The house will come to order. Members, please take your seats. Visitors,
please retire from the chamber. Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery,
members, please silence all cellular phones and all personal electronic
devices. The pray will be offered by representative Alma Adams. Members
and visitors in the gallery, please stand and remain standing for the
Pledge of Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
This is the day that the Lord has made, we will rejoice and be glad in
it. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for this day. It is a day that we
are grateful to have. One that we have not seen before. We thank you for
life, and health, and strength, for family and friends, and the
opportunity to serve and do your will as servants of your people. We
remain grateful to you and acknowledge that you have provided this
opportunity of servant leadership for each of us. Not because of any
good or gracious thing that we might have done, but only because of your
goodness and your mercy. We thank you for your tender loving mercy.
Lord, your words are true and you credit righteousness to those who
trust in you. Guide us back to you when we fall into disobedience and
teach us how to examine our ways. You have said in your word that
obedience is better than sacrifice, so help us to know the difference.
Lord, we are meeting today to conduct matters of business for your
people, guide our hearts and our minds with the spirit of fairness,
right thought, and speech. Park your supreme wisdom upon our activities,
so that our affairs may reach a successful conclusion. Help us always to
remember Galatians 6:10, which says, as we have opportunity we should do
good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of
faith. Thank you for being our source of guidance today and the days to
come. We ask all of these things in the precious name of your son. Amen.

Gentlemen of the house this bill is just a clarifing in the original

having voted in the affirmative and two in the negative. The amendment

follow up question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone does the
gentleman yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the time that they visited did you tell any
of them about these proposed bills or ask any them about it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] When the Lee county board of education. One or two of them came
by my office. I answered all the questions they had provided for me
about the session that they asked. I give them 45 minutes to ask any
questions that they wanted to ask. And I provided all their answers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But you didn't tell them about the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If the members will please direct questions through the
chairmen. Does the lady wish to ask a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just trying to ascertain whether he told them he
was proposing this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the time they came to my
office I dodn't know we even had the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
May I have permission now to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I also represent
part of Lee county and that 65 percent of the city of Sanford and both
the town board of Sanford, their board of commissioners, and the school
board strongly object to this bill. They came and spoke in committee
against this bill. They did not know about this bill until after it was
filed. And they immediately contacted me to say what can you do to stop
this. And I confessed possibly very little but that I would do my best.
Because I believe that as far as I understood the representative
proposing this bill has stood for less government and less restrictive
government. And to me this is state government telling municipalities
what they have to do when they strongly object to doing that. And it
serves no purpose. As a ten year member of a board of education in
Chatham county I have felt like politics, partisan politics in
particular, had no place on a board of education. I would assume the
same would go for a town board that is trying to do the best for the
citizens in a township. I honestly have served with school board members
that I did not know their party. It was never an issue of partisan
politics with school board</p>

There was no referendum. I'm not sure how many citizens really know
about it. When we say up here that we talk to the citizens in our
community we probably just talk to the few that we normally interact
with, and I'm not sure that the entire community is really aware of this
and I think that's a disservice to them to do that, and particularly
since the governing bodies, that we're talking about changing here,
don't want it, but again we're dabbling in people's personal business. I
just think that when we start talking about what we need to do for our
children that we need to be pretty even on that, and I do think that
there are some philosophical differences between parties too, and
sometimes that translates into how we vote on things and what we put
forward, so I would have some concerns on this bill and I would ask you
not to vote for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.

To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The comment has been made earlier, I believe in a committed meeting,
that there is no such thing in the state of North Carolina as
nonpartisan elections. I live in ?? County, and you figure from the news
that we've made over the years that there holds true that statement.
It's not nonpartisan, and we do owe it to our citizens to educate them.
Now when somebody in a nonpartisan race is running they won't ?? an
apple pie, they just don't tell you how they wanna get there.
Representative Adams mentioned the philosophical differences,
Representative McManus has mentioned the achievement gaps. There are two
different ways to work in that, one is teacher tenure and one is teacher
merit pay. Very extreme differences, but when someone runs for the
school board they tell you they want qualified teachers they may not be
telling you how they want to get them once they've been elected. That's
where we owe it to our citizens to let them know the methodology.
Everybody wants the same result, we want a safe public, we want educated
students, we want healthy individuals in our state, but what we argue
about is the methodology and that's what are citizens need to know. When
we get elected how are we gonna do it? Thanks you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ?? is right now to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the house. I know
that we respect the citizens that vote, not only for us but who vote for
our locally elected officials, and when we get into a position of
deciding that we want to make that decision for them without doing a
survey, or a poll, or having a public hearing of some type then we may
be taking away from them, their right to have the government of their
choice. I don't think you know just because of someone's party
affiliation what they're going to do on particular issues and I know all
republicans in this chamber don't think alike. Representative Jones came
here, was not a republican, became a republican after he got here, so
you couldn't know how he would've thought before he got here and
democrats the same way. To say that we're gonna improve the selection by
the local citizens by putting, or requiring, that these be partisan
elections doesn't do anything to say that they will have better, more
representatives, or a more effective government. I ask that you not
support this. If the citizens have been able to elect the five
republicans they did, presumably they learned about the candidates,
they're positions, and made that choice and that's what we should
encourage them to continue to do. Learn about the candidates, their
positions, how they're gonna get things achieved and vote based on that.
Not just let dumb the election down and say 'just vote D or just vote
R.'
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ?? right now is to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. It's precisely because we have these philosophical
differences that it's important that we know who we're voting for. A lot
of the folks that vote have no clue whose running for the school board,
they have no clue whose running for the county commission, and the only
thing that they will know is if</p>

[0:00:00.0]
It’s a partisan election is that they are Republican or Democrat and
there are huge competing ideologies with regard to government and why
all Republicans don’t think exactly the same and all Democrats don’t
think exactly the same? There is a huge divide in what we believe
philosophically, ideologically. When I go to vote I like to know what
party somebody is, the bottom line is there is no such thing as a
non-partisan election because if you will think about it everybody that
has run in a so called ‘Non-Partisan Election’ they showed up, all the
Republicans have showed up that your party headquarters and ___[00:35]
precinct meetings the Republican precinct meetings and the Democrats
show up at the Democrat precinct meetings. So, everyone is still running
as a republican or as a democrat. The only ones that don’t know what
they are the people that actually have to cast the ballot. As far as
whether or not the gentleman let the boards know that are sitting what
difference will that make, their incumbents it’s not about them, it’s
about the people have any opportunity to know when they get ready for
the next election who these people are not everybody spent the amount of
time that folks like us might do researching the candidates and looking
to see who they are? If you have the information that says Republican or
Democrat they gives you a basic ideological ground work for making new
decision and I recommend that we pass this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, I want to just bring two points to the
body’s attention. One and it’s particularly queued in an area like mine
but that’s bill over I believe into Lee County, one of the restrictions
you will be putting on and that we put on whenever we move to partisan
elections for the most part under the Hatch Act, it eliminates anyone
who is Federal Government Service from seriously being candidates for
partisan offices, if you ran a non-partisan office the Hatch Act allows
you to run. So, what we do and towns that have large Federal long claves
for Federal workforce or employees although there are few exceptions to
it effectively we are eliminating anybody from now seeking these seats,
who is a Federal employee because of the Hatch Act. So, I think there is
a very legitimate reason why a lot of districts keep non-partisan
outside of issues we have talked about on the floor. The second point
and the other reason why although I agree with some of the speakers who
have made the point that when we call non-partisan it ends up often, too
often I think lately being partisan elections. I do think and perhaps
because of the experience I had let Representative ___[02:46] on my
school board, my desk colleague was the lone Republican on the board we
did probably more together than anyone and she bring her board together
and we never much thought about those issues at least on the school
board. I will agree the come election time it becomes always more of a
challenge to maintain that. To given what's occurring and the partisan
nature what's occurring across the country I think that there are at
least legitimate reasons to keep things non-partisan that would not
however be my second reason for voting against the bill. My second
reason is when we make fundamental changes in the election process to
our counties I think it comes to us not to sort of look out at town home
meetings, one or two we may have and our friends I think it’s coming on
us to have a wide spread comment in multiple forms before we bring that
kind of bill to the floor because we know what we want, we know what we
believe and we can all become insulated here and we are talking about
the citizens, right. And I don’t think in all fairness when in fact even
the boards involved and fairly knew this bill was coming you can say or
any of us can say that there was wide spread notice and publicity and
the comment capacity in the county, it maybe that Representative Stone
is exactly write about where his constituents lay but I think it’s safe
to say that we would no better had there been time for it to be out in
the public and for true public comment to occurring because I think
that’s been truncated here and because I do believe in our area of the
state the ___[04:24] there are huge numbers of people doing distant
franchise from running under this bill for important spots I’m going to
vote against the bill, thank you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, Representative Glazier and one of my points about

are registering coming to the state, they are not registering
republicans and they are not registering ___[04:54], the registrant is
unaffiliated and what this bill does is taking the largest growing
percentage and they can’t…

education, share in the power in that city and in the decision making.
Educational policy should be set by professional educators who are doing

less and so I don't understand why you would want to keep voters from
finding that out. Thank you.

this will be a little bit less controversial bill. This is a bill that I
believe is just good public policy. You can see from the draft on the
dashboard that it's a pretty long bill but it's really just a change of
a few sentences. Staff and I felt like by laying the bill out, you could
see how minor the changes were. You could see how it fit and flowed with
the current law. Currently after a DWI conviction, after a year of
driving on a limited driving privilege, you can go down to DMV and get
your license back...</p>

When they give you your license back, they put a restriction on your
license much like an eyeglasses restriction. It simply says you can
continue to drink and drive, just don't drink as much. Your limit is
now, instead of a .08 legal limit, it is now .04. For people who are
repeat offenders, or people who had a high BAC the first time, we have a
zero tolerance. You'll see under B and C of the different statutes that
are set out, you will see that .00. This bill would simply change the
.04 to the .00 for all offenders while you have this restricted license.
The sheriff's association has come out and supported the bill, and I
have emailed you that. There is a small fiscal note available, I emailed
you that, I don't believe there will be much of a fiscal impact on this.
I do believe this is just public policy and just telling folks &quot;You
made a mistake, don't do it again. Don't drink and drive for at least

Representative, in going through these debates before, it was brought
out that cough medicines and things might cause an alcohol reading, has
that been reviewed and would that occur?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative, that question has been asked to me both
privately and in caucus. The response I got from staff when I asked that
question is that although the law currently says there is a zero
tolerance, that people who are required to have an interlock, the DMV
actually sets the positive reading somewhere higher than .00, so that
cough medicine and certain foods should not trigger a positive result,
that they do not set it at .00, and they tell me that this change would
be consistent with that. If I find out otherwise, I would certainly let

Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I first became aware of
this issue about a year ago. I had a class of fourth-graders who came to
visit, and I brought them in here and we talked, I told them about how
laws were made, and then about a week or so later I got thank-you notes
from the students. They sent me little pictures and they wrote, but they
printed it. All of them were fourth-graders and they all printed, and
some of them did not know how to turn the paper to write the notes. I
started asking &quot;Are children not writing cursive anymore? Are we
not teaching cursive anymore?&quot; I have two school systems in my
district, and the city school system said Yes and No, that the teachers
had a choice. Some did teach it and some didn't teach it. But some of
our students were not being given this skill. Our county school system
said they were teaching it. So I asked my county school system if they
would please give me some research, and they did.</p>

there is licensure paperwork renewal and et cetera. And what's happening
is that information not just the business aspect of it, but the
personal-private information is open to records request and we've had
numerous examples of this being exploited. One of the more severe
examples was this December in Jacksonville, North Carolina where a felon
rapist was apprehended and had a long list of real estate agents' home
addresses and phone numbers and House Bill 214 solves this issue while

[??] distribution. General Assembly of North Carolina next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, before we go to debate on this, just again
for your edification, the Chair allowed the votes to change, allowed the
members to be excused from the vote because the Chair did not anticipate
that it would change the outcome. If those votes changes had changed the
outcome it would have been out of order and the vote would have stood.
Representative Davis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the
House, this bill has to do with equitable distribution, which is a
division of marital assets and debts in a domestic case. It was drafted
with the assistance of the North Carolina Bar Association and a Family
Law District Court judge. It comes to you with a favorable report from
Judiciary C. The changes are two-fold. One, as the law now stands, it
states that it is presumed that all property acquired after the date of
marriage and before the date of separation is marital property, except
property which is separate property, under subdivision two of this
subsection. This presumption may be rebutted by the greater weight of
the evidence. The situation we have is that the language does not
differentiate between personal property and real property. Case law in
North Carolina holds that if a party who is married during the marriage
conveys their separate property in real estate to the other spouse as
husband and wife, which is tenants by the entirety, that there is a
presumption that there is a gift to the marital estate. That follows the
language in the statute. But also, in that particular situation, the
burden of proof by the case law is by a clear, cogent and convincing
evidence, which is a much stricter burden of proof than greater weight
of the evidence. So, what this aspect of the bill is doing is to codify
what is now the case law in North Carolina. And once again, that is
simply that all real property creating a tenancy by the entirety
acquired after the date of marriage and before the date of separation is
marital property. So it really doesn't change anything that's in our
case law. Once again, it simply codifies it. But, this bill does do one
thing. It changes the burden from the case law, that being the greater
burden of clear, cogent and convincing evidence to make it be the same
presumption as that set forth in the statue being rebutted by the
greater weight of the evidence, because you would not want two burdens
within the same statute. The other aspect of the bill deals with the
definition of the visible property. The visible property is what happens
to either personal or real property from the date of separation until
the time you do the equitable distribution. Visible property, per the
statute, is defined as being passive appreciation or passive
depreciation, which simply means something either accumulates in value
or decreases in value just sitting there, like a bank account. If you
have interest that accrues after the date of separation, that's passive.
If you put a deposit into the bank, that's active. If you do addition to
your house, that's active. If the real estate value goes up just because
real estate values go up through no action of your own, that's passive.
So, what the second change does is, lower down under the definition of
the visible property, it simply said under the existing law: increases
and decreases in marital debt and financing charges and interest
relating to marital debt. What this does is change the language to say,
passive increases and passive decreases, because once again, that is
what the visible property is; it's passive. So that's just a
clarification there. And Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time, I
understand Representative Sarah Stevens has an amendment. The bill as
presented, our existing law stated that the Act is effected when it
becomes law but because we're changing the bill, the amendment which I
support would state that this Act becomes effective on October 1. And I
would answer any questions that you might have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens is recognized in support of the
amendment. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens must amend the bill on page
two, line twenty-two by re-writing the line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis said it all. We just ask for your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
set forth by Representative Davis</p>

The Speaker Pro Tempore: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Rep. Malone: Ladies and gentlemen, this bill transfers the authority to
prescribe forms for the application and permit for concealed carry from
the administrative offices of the courts of the state to the SBI.
Largely this is already programatically done, by the way. We had a
member of the AOC there to answer that question.
It requires the clerk of court to transmit an order expunging a
conviction to the SBI and for the SBI to forward the information to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI. It qualifies for benefits
under the Crimes Victims Rights Act to any victim of persons committing
an assault on firefighters, emergency responders, or health care
professionals. It also grants jurisdiction for magistrates to hear open
burning cases.
It also clarifies, and this is the last point, that a person seeking
expungement of a criminal offense must wait the statutorially-prescribed
period, either from the date of the conviction or the date when the
sentence, to include post-release supervision, if applicable, or
probationary period, have been completed, whichever is later.
This passed committee yesterday unanimously. Any legal questions I will
give to the other primary, Senator Stevens, and I commend this to you
all and ask you to vote.

Engraved by the State Board of Education. General Assembly of North
Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Langdon, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill and send forth an
amendment. I send the amendment first. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Langdon moves to amend the bill on page 3, lines
31 and 32, by adding between the lines a new section read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The amendment in the Education Committee came up about whether
or not exception of children were taken care of in this. So what I’ve
done is amend my bill to take care of that. This is the law in relation
to that whole program. And this amendment covers that and I think helps
my bill so I appreciate you vote for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cotham, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker and members. I just rise in support of this amendment and
thank Representative Langdon for bringing it forward. We did have a few
questions in the House Education Committee specifically in regards to
this amendment. So thank you for bringing it forward and I ask for your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the
amendment. If not, the question before the House is the passage of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Langdon to the House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 435. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] All members wishing to record,
please do so at this time. The clerk will lock the machine and record
the vote. 110 having voted in the affirmative, none in the negative, the
amendment passes. We’re back on the bill. Representative Langdon is
recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Folks, what we’re trying to do with this bill is take care
of something that is already law. And in the last session, there was in
the budget, a system on rating schools. And that was an uncodified
system. What I’m trying to do is codify the way we’re going to rate them
and to make it fair and hopefully we’ll do what we wanted to do which is
carefully look at schools, come up with a score that actually ends up
showing that school’s position. So this is not changing anything in the
sense of that other than trying to fix something that I think was wrong.
And I hope that you will agree with me. One of the things that we need
to do is make sure when we’re rating schools, that we come out with a
system that actually rates them correctly and verifies their position
and doesn’t harm them in the sense of that. Now it came up in the
Education Committee that there’s a mix of schools. And this is because
of where they’re located, and the clientele they have. Hopefully this
redoing of what we’ve got will actually take care of that, and support
the schools that may have some barriers because of where they’re at and
disputed clientele they have, all those things that go into making sure
schools are doing what they need to do. And most of all, educating the
children that are in that school, from wherever they come from and
whatever they bring to that school. So hopefully we’re addressing that.
I don’t think this is a complete fix, but it is a lot better and I would
hope you would support the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Cotham, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized
to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
Representative Langdon. Thank you for allowing me to be a primary
sponsor with you on this important piece of legislation. As the
Representative said, this debate today, this policy decision is not
about grading our schools A through F. So whatever opinion you may have
on that, that is really not what is before us. What I think we’re doing
and what the House could be commended on in House Leadership, is making
this bill better. And making it more fair, as the Representative said.
This bill will seek to delay the grading of the A through F schools by
one year. So there will be a delay. Part of the reason for that is
because as we all know, North Carolina will participate in the Common
Core Standards that will start this Fall. Part of the concern</p>

<p id="80:00">
... and the problem is if we do not do this bill today, then we're going
to start grading our schools incorrectly and it could really cause more
of a problem a year from now when Common Core has already started. That
is part of the reason.
The other part of the reason is that as the bill that has already passed
and is already law, is written, and there are a few little issues with
that, almost 70% of all of our schools in North Carolina would have a D
or an F. That's not the way we want to start out and I'm not saying they
should all start out with an A because that's absolutely not correct.
But there's something wrong in that piece and in that measurement and so
our bill hopes to look at that and to correct that. Again, and for those
who are listening, I know there's been a lot of confusion but this bill
does not say we are already going to grade the schools A through F. That
is already current law. We are hoping to make that law better and I do
ask for your support. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The ?? is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I agree
with what both Representative Langdon and Representative Cotham have
said about how we are making the best of a bad situation. I think that
was a ?? Motown song, I think, a few years ago. We’re making the best of
a bad situation but it's important to recognize that this came into law
through the budget which means it didn't really have a full, in 2012,
Representative Langdon.
What it means, members, is that we did not have a full discussion of
this through the policy committees. It just really was popped in the
budget and I certainly understand how sometimes to get the budget done
you have to accept things from the other side that you really wouldn't
want to accept if it had had a debate in our chamber.
The fact of the matter is, I think many of us on the House Education
Committee feel it's a very troublesome thing to put the A through F
label on, particularly on the schools that get an F label.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The gentleman would ask the, the Chair would ask the
gentleman to stay focused on the content of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes, sir. I will. I'm coming right to it. What I'm
just saying is I think it would, in my opinion what we ought to do is
repeal that which is in statute and therefore, while this bill makes the
best of a bad situation, I really just think it's unfortunate that we
even have this.
When I cast my vote no against this and maybe others would too, it's to
say the whole idea of labeling schools D and F when teachers and
principals are trying so hard, particularly in high-poverty schools to
do this, it's just a real problem and we ought to get rid of the whole
darn thing of A through F. Thank you, members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the House is to pass it to the House committee
substitute, to House Bill 435 is submitted on its second reading. All
those in favor, vote Aye. All opposed, vote No. The clerk will open the
vote. All members wishing to record, please do so at this time. The
clerk will ?? record the vote, 105 having voted affirmative and four in

[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Senate Bill 123, a bill to ?? clarify the existing
law pertaining to sex offenders residing near schools or daycare
centers. General Assembly of North Carolina ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Zelka [sounds like], please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Ladies and gentlemen, Senate Bill 123 is really
correcting a problem with the original bill when it was passed several
years ago. The specific date that you'll see on your screens was not
entered into the general statutes and that caused enforcement problems
for law enforcement district attorneys.
Law enforcement and association district attorneys asked us to fix that
by putting the exact date for this to be in effect into statute so that
there'll be no confusion when they go prosecute these cases and enforce
the law. This bill fixes that problem and it does not in any way change
the original intent of the law. Had unanimous support in the Senate and
I recommend the bill to you.</p>
