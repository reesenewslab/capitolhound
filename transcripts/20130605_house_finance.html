has a Fire Department and a Police Department and they will provide fire
and police if called upon, but in fact the airport has it’s own Fire
Department and it in fact has it’s own Police Department.  So no the
city doesn’t actually provide those services to the airport.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We had a, obviously we were sent information, a lot
of us, that the city does provide and there was a plan here laid out
about their provisions of providing those services for the airport, the
city, and the money.  It’s a laid out email that some of us got.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I guess then my response would be well if we
de-annexed they won’t have to provide those services to the city of, the
actual airport, but as a practical matter we’ve got to recognize that
the airport has it’s own Fire Department and it’s own Police Department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I’d like to make a motion for
a favorable report for House Bill 568.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further questions of Representative Hamilton?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In terms of water and sewer
services, did you address those?  Are they provided to the airport
property at this point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, the City of Asheville provides water to pretty
much all that part of the county, not just within it’s municipal limits.
So, it’s not a service that’s specifically provided because the airport
is within the city.  In fact, it provides water in the area.  Sewer
service is provided by a regional authority, not by the city of
Asheville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Are there folks here from Asheville today that are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I believe the city has a lobbyist here representing
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Would it be appropriate to hear from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. ?? if you will please approach the podium and
state your name for the record.  Even though I’ve already addressed you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’m Jack ??.  Do you want me to answer specific
questions or just give you the view of the City of Asheville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  If you would, both if the committee wishes, but if
you would like to give the general view of the City of Asheville over
this bill we would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The City of Asheville is not in favor of this bill.
In fact the information that Representative Carney referred to was
provided by Scott Burnette who is the Fire Chief  for the City of
Asheville. There is somewhat of a partnership between the City of
Asheville and it’s Fire Department and the Fire Department that is at
the airport.  They do a lot of work together.  There were plans for the
Airport Fire Department to move into a new facility and the old facility
was going to be renovated by the City of Asheville and they were going
to be providing additional fire services to the airport. They do at this
time provide some fire services and other first responder services,
emt’s and that sort of thing.  So the question the City of Asheville
would have is that if this bill passes and they’re no longer responsible
who’s going to make of the deficit because the city does in cooperation
with the airport provide some services now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Those services can be picked up by Skyland Fire
Department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  I was looking for comments from the
community as well.  Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further questions or comments from the committee?
Questions from the Representative of Asheville?  If not, members of the
committee you have heard the motion from Representative Moffitt to give
House Bill 568 a favorable report and then a re-referral to the
committee on government if favorable.  All in favor say aye.  All
opposed?  Motion carried.  Thank you Representative McGrady and good
luck in government.  You’re gonna need it.  At this time we will have,
as you need luck to take any bill to any committee in the general
assembly.  We will have House bill 558 Soil and Water District Refunds.
Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chair.  Thank you committee for hearing
this bill.  This bill should be a kindler gentler bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well that’ll be the day but please continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  With that, House Bill 558 Soil and Water District
Refunds Bill, what we’ve got around our state out of 100 counties, all
but 5 of the counties, their soil and water district is</p>

&lt;h3&gt;basically defined by their county as far as boundaries, their
state organizations up in the far northeast. We have five counties due
to population and what have you that are rolled into one grouping. So
there's 96. Out of these 96 districts, which do some incredible work. I
grew up on a farm. And if you live anywhere in the vicinity where you
may have streams, creaks, rivers, waterways, etcetera, they yeoman's
work when it comes to basically stream bank stabilization, erosion
control, what have you, very practical manner in which its done. The
very essential in the function that they have. 86 of them get their
sales tax rebated. 10 of them don't. And from a reform standpoint
standardized and basically make it where they're all, which they all do
the same function, basically operate on the same sheet I'm using when it
comes to the sales tax rebates and that's only for certain sales tax as
defined. This bill would standardize all of our solo water districts so
that they have the same sales tax rebate. The cost of this, while it is
an estimate, the fiscal memo gives a range of $5000 to $40000 total, the
entire state. Our figures that we've calculated puts it more of in a box
of 5-10,000 dollars to fix this issue. And I know 5-10,000 dollars on a
personal level is a lot of money in my household, but from the
standpoint of our multi multi billion dollar budget, that's what it
would cost to fix this problem. I ask you to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. A motion for a favorable report ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'll ask you a question and then if you don't have the answer
then staff can. But, how did we get into the situation where some water
districts are treated different than others as far as tax status goes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. I do have such a matter of expertise ?? let me take a
stab at that. The sole water districts had transferred from deaner to
agg and the way the majority of them are able to benefit from the tax
rebate, they're state entities but they will have their purchasing put
under the local government where they're located. There are some, for
various reasons, which if we need more detail I will defer to the
division director solo water who's here in the room with us. There are
some ?? some of which are regionalized with the five counties rolled
into one and other specifics, but there are flies in the ointment to
make this simple. That is a great question. That is one of the first
things I had.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me address the question staff as opposed to the water quality over
here. What was it a collection of local bills that have come through the
general assembly over the years giving them tax refunds? Or, I mean, I'm
just curious, usually we have a we try to keep it systematic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding was the same as the Representative explained. It was
just that most of these districts were claiming them a refund under the
county government for getting it you know because counties are eligible
for sale tax refund but not all of them are able to do that. So that's
the extent of my understanding of that as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions or comments from the Committee? You have heard the
motion for a favorable report from Representative Waddell for House Bill
number 558. All in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed.  Motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Committee thank you for your kind patience as this
meeting is adjourned.
