House Bill 157: Amend Environmental Laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen and the senate, the reason
why we have to take up this bill on this type of fashion is that over
last two weeks we have been a victim of climate change of the snow, it’s
supposed just back about two and the half weeks of getting this bill in,
in front of their line on the 17th, we have a good discussion in the
Agriculture Committee by a lot of the technical changes in this bill and
if you want I can go through each section of technical changes or I can
get to some other areas where you have the questions such as the oil and
gas exploration but part of that was I will just explain it just to make
sure that the rules that we already had in place are adopted in a proper
way because right now we have the rules in place and we are not adopted
because we thought we had rules in place, this is just make things to
clarify that we do have the process and for air quality, currently there
are 400…

  ...43 air toxic rules that are on the books, and that&#39;s with federal
and state so that should take care of that issue. The recycled and
recovered materials, or some clarified definitions on technicals. One
thing is on electronics devices and the statutes. As an example, we have
spelled out a notebook computer, but as technology changes so fast that
with tablets and other type of electronic devices we changed the
definition of that in this statutes to make sure we can use those. As
far as recycled materials also with still flag as another clarifying
definition of that we can use as that material and other issues and its
just clarifying that one, but I think most of the questions were on the
shale gas expiration and the toxics and we think with the federal laws
that are out there and the additional North Carolina rules that are out
there that it should take care of all questions that are out there. We
had a good discussion in Agriculture Committee and the vote was
unanimous. I&#39;ll answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or ??. Senator Bryant for what purpose she rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill presenter a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And there may be some concern enough that we might need some staff
support since this was just heard and committed this morning. But,
Senator Brock, can you explain what is the impact of the change in terms
of allowing the EMC to default to the state and federal air quality
rules? Does that prohibit them from enacting any different rules if they
would find those rules to be desirable? Does it prohibit the mining
commission from getting EMC studied or approval of additional rules?
What is the impact of that preemption if you could explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll try to do this to best of my I may have to call on staff to
answer each part of your question. One thing they do have, still have,
the 60 days for any permits will be offered or extended and, honestly,
with the way the economics are right now with the price of gas this is
long term off. Gas price keeps dropping. They found another play in
Marsalis which kind of pushes us back further on the back burner which
is good. We can have some of the out there, however, having this in
place. When we passed 820 in 2012 there was 3 directives that made the 3
agencies to create a regulatory program for this so the EMC, the ??, the
Public Health and that&#39;s what we are trying to do, was trying to
make all the rule making process that we&#39;re putting in, of all the
different agencies, is that we basically left this loophole in there
which the provisions were not put in place in time, even though the
rules were already there. The federal rules were already there. And like
I say, with air toxics, is that with the 430...there are 433 federal
rules and an additional, including North Carolina, 447. So this goes far
and above what the EPA Department wants to do. We just try to get it in
time because what will happen is when the 17th comes around the rules
will not be quote &quot;in place&quot; even though the rules are already
on the books.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Chair - Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant for what purpose does she rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My understanding of this language around the air quality
issue is that the Environmental Management Commission shall adopt rules
if it determines that the state and federal rules are not - are
inadequate which doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t adopt rules, or
that the rules process is like 100% preemptive is my understanding. In
terms of the comfort of some of the other members we might want to get
some staff reiteration of that if they have questions. On that basis
I&#39;m supporting the amends bill. I know there&#39;s some concern in
environmental community that this will signal a sort of weakening of the
commitment to have some of the strongest environmental protections we
can have as we go into the fracking era, and they feel that this might
be a retrenchment from that. My understanding is that additional rule
making, should it be deemed necessary, can be made. ...

  <p id="10:00">
  So I’m banking on that interpretation and that reality from what I’m
reading. I just wanted to acknowledge on the floor for some of my
constituents who are concerned that there would be a significant
opposition if we were in any way weakening the air quality protections
that will be needed when we engage in fracking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Bryant a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, do you yield?

bill?

  It’s third reading. The amendment will be engrossed and it will be sent
to the House. Members we wanna thank our pages for this week. We’ve had
a full week of debate and I hope they’ve enjoyed their time, but let’s
thank them for their service this week. Thank you, pages. [applause]
Notices and announcements. Senator Brown, for what purpose to do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege when you get a
chance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s see if there’s some notices. Senator
Newton for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] An announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. Just a reminder for members of J1 there is still a 10 o’clock
committee meeting scheduled but it should be brief so if you’re on J1
please come to our regular place. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other
notices or announcements. Senator Brown is recognized for a moment of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies
and gentlemen of the Senate, I know you’ve heard and it was mentioned
yesterday in the prayer about the helicopter crash in Florida. Seven
members on that helicopter were from my district at Camp Majourn. Those
Marines were part of the special ops that trained in Onslow County and
those special op Marines are really like Navy Seals. That’s how
extensive training that they go through and I was reading an article in
the paper today and to give you an idea of just how trained these guys
are, it says that they’re trained enough to form a team that could train
200-300 foreign forces, so this is a major loss I know in my community
and I think for the Marine Corps in general cause these guys are special
guys and you know, if you ever get a chance to go to Onslow County and
go to see where this takes place, this is built up over time. there’s
probably I guess 4,000-5,000 marines at the special ops training center
now in Onslow County and these guys go in places nobody else wants to go
and they really are special guys and it’s gonna have a huge impact on
our community, so in closing we might wanna recognize these seven
marines. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further notices or announcements? Is there
further business to come before the Senate? If not, the chair recognizes
Senator Pate for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. President. I move that
the Senate do now adjourn subject to the memory of those marines who
were lost in the defense of our nation and our national way of life,
subject to the standard stipulations set forth in Senate rule 24.1, the
receipt and referral of committee reports, receipt of conference
reports, the ratification of bills, appointment of conferees and
messages from the House to reconvene on Monday, March 16, 2015 at 7PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn in memory
of the marines who lost their lives subject to the stipulations stated
by Senator Pate to reconvene Monday, March 16, 2015 at 7PM. Seconded by
Senator Brown. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Opposed no. The ayes have it and the Senate stands adjourned.
