<p id="05:00">
think about things. I had a, and this isn't real unique, but I had a
professor in business school and I remember he used to talk about,
there's really three types of risks that business people, that
governments, that all of us face in a society. The first is that which
we know, right? That being we know that if we create a business there
might be a competitor that pops up, they may lower their prices and
force us to lower our prices. That is what I call we know what we know
there. The second area of risk is that which we know that we do not
know, that being the idea that if we take a loan, for instance, that the
interest rate and the cost of that loan may change over time if we have
a variable rate interest. That's what know as it relates to unknown. The
third category, and that is what I think we're really discussing today,
is that that we do not know that we do not know. An example of this in
business is, all of the sudden, government decides that they don't like
your business anymore and they're going to regulate you out of business.
That is what we do not know what we do not know. So the third category
of risk, the unknown of the unknown as I like to call it, is the area of
risk that is unacceptable to a marketplace. It creates instability and
uncertainty in the marketplace and in society. It deters risk taking,
undermines entrepreneurial drive and, in short, it's not really a good
thing for our economy. By voting in favor of this bill you will be
declaring that our state government is somehow above the legal and moral
obligations expected of its citizens and private enterprise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. [??]. I appreciate it. Mr Hill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. My name is Skip Hill, I am a citizen but I also serve as
the Raleigh Vice President of Highwoods Properties which is a commercial
real estate developer. And like many developers in North Carolina,
Highwoods has been consistently supportive of utilizing the Dix Campus
as a signature urban park which can be enjoyed by all citizens of North
Carolina. But the many social and economic reasons that have been
discussed for years, and again, I want to echo what Mr. Pool said, this
is not a partisan issue. And so I come up here and I personally applaud
our North Carolina representatives for being diligent in pursuing ways
to be good stewards of the state's assets on behalf of the state's
citizens. I think that is good.  However, the state of North Carolina
and the city of Raleigh recently entered into a legal agreement to lease
the Dorothea Dix property to the city for use as a signature park. To my
knowledge the process was fully vetted within the governing and rules of
the state of North Carolina, giving full consideration to use, values,
income, elimination of state expenses, maintenance, and a plethora of
other considerations. This was reviewed at both city and state levels,
voted on by the Council of State, most of whom were re-elected by the
citizens of North Carolina, and unless there was some sort of unlawful
activity or the North Carolina state process was not followed as
lawfully provided, then it is my opinion that  to undo a contract signed
by the good faith of the state of North Carolina should require very,
very, very careful consideration. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll go a lot faster if we can hold the applause down. Mr. Schmidt,
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Harvey Schmitt, President, Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce. Mr
Chairman, committee members, good to see you all again. I, too, would
like to reemphasize the fact that we do not see this as a partisan
issue. This had broad support throughout the community. Last December
the state and the city entered into a contract to lease the property to
the city of Raleigh for use a signature urban park. This lease was
entered into in good faith and offered significant benefits to both
parties. Moreover, we believe this to be the best use of the Dix Campus
for the future benefit of the state at large and we encourage you to
share with your colleagues that they consider the impact that the
creation of a new destination park in North Carolina's capital city will
have in promoting economic development in one of the state's vital
regions with resulting high-quality jobs and increased tax base for the
state as a whole. Businesses and their employees choose locations based
on a number of factors, one of which is the cultural and recreational
facilities in the area. A large park will help doing that. I would note
that the residents in a three county triangle region contribute over 2.6
billion dollars in state</p>

sales tax and personal income taxes representing 17% of the tax
collections in these areas. One of the primary reasons our region is
able to make these contributions to the state, is because it offers a
great quality of life and regularly attracts talented people and good
jobs to our state. We believe that limiting the community's ability to
transform this campus into a large park would be detrimental to the
state's continued growth and development. This conversation is about the
future of our region and our state, and we encourage our delegation in a
bipartisan fashion to help our community and state come to a solution
that respects the good faith expectations of the lease in force.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. As you come to speak, it would be helpful
just to say for the record, your name and if you're representing an
organization, when you come speak. I believe Mr. Cain is next. Mr.
Whitehurst. Mr. Huberman.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. My name is Joseph
Huberman, and I was appointed to the Dorothea Dix Legislative Study
Commission in 2003. I've been working to create a public-private
partnership to develop Dix Park now for ten years. During these years I
have been involved in four studies. In each study, there was a lot of
public input, and the net result was always that the public wanted the
entire remaining tract to be a fantastic world class destination park.
The lease negotiated in 2012 was not a rush job. It was the culmination
of years of work to find the optimum use for this wonderful property.
And when the 75 year lease is over, and the state has collected
approximately 85 million dollars from the city of Raleigh, the state
will own the park, and the many millions of dollars of improvements that
went into it. The Dorothea Dix campus used to exceed 2,000 acres, and
now all but 306 acres have been committed to other uses. In order to
make a world class destination park, it is important that the whole
remaining Dix campus be used to create this park. If there is private
development on the land, then the remaining acreage will not attract
investment around the park, and will not provide the substantial
economic multiplication that a large destination urban park will create.
The public-private partnership that this lease created is a promise that
the state made with the city, the business community, and the citizens
of North Carolina. If you renege on this lease, it will send a chilling
signal to every other group that wishes to do business with the state of
North Carolina. Don't set the precedent of being the first legislature
to destroy the credibility of the word of North Carolina. And finally, I
would like to ask the people who came here to support the park to please
stand for a moment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Lynn
Edmonds. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Lynn Edmonds and I live here in
Raleigh. I'm here today to oppose senate bills 236 and 325, both
targeting the Wake County school system. I am the parent of two Wake
County Public School students, and I believe very strongly that control
of facilities and the building of new schools needs to stay in the hands
of the school board. School programming is directly related to school
facilities. What teachers do and what goes on in the classroom is
closely tied to the design of school buildings. The school board knows
better than the commissioners what teachers and students need in their
facilities. It is the school board who has great experience in designing
and building high quality schools for Wake County. This is evident in
the fact that Wake school system has received numerous national awards
for their school designs. The facilities department in Wake County
schools have vast knowledge and experience in building schools. And as I
said before, they have been nationally recognized for their work. This
assertion that educators are making all the decisions is misleading to
the public. It is imperative that educators are involved in facility
design because programming is so directly linked to the physical space
where teachers teach and students learn. Another assertion that's been
made is that we need this bill because the county's bond rating is at
risk. This is a huge perversion of the facts. It is, under the current
model, Wake County has the highest bond rating possible, a triple A bond
rating. Again, under the current model, where the commissioners fund the
schools and buildings, and the school board controls them, Wake County
has the highest bond rating possible. The bond rating agencies
understand this relationship, and those that claim that the bond rating
is at risk are trying to deceive the public into believing this bill is
necessary.</p>

<p id="15:00">
Finally, it is egregious that Senate Bill 325 redistricts our school
board lines again, only two years after this was done. Do not support
these bills. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Dr. Earl Johnson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, for another opportunity to come before
you. I am Revered Earl Johnson, pastor of Martin Street Baptist Church
and President of the Rotting Wake Citizens Association, RWCA. I am here
too, to oppose Senate Bill 236 and Senate Bill 325. I believe that
Senate Bill 236 will weaken the power of the Wake County School Board,
by allowing County Commissioners to control the construction, design,
and maintenance of our schools is essentially taking powers away from
our school system. My fear is that shifting this power away from the
school board would be a colossal failure, as the commissioners do not
have the experience, and from talking to some of them, they do not even
have the desire to take on what they already know the school board
should be doing. Further, I don't think that the public, students,
teachers, taxpayers in general are too enthusiastic about the fact that
commissioners would be designing their classrooms and auditoriums. In my
opinion, this is an attempt to take away power from the school board,
and to punish and to control the school board itself. If this bill is
passed, I, along with other groups in the county, would do as much as we
can to ensure that no bond for school construction is passed in this
County. Finally, I am also opposed to Bill 325, which would change the
way Wake County citizens elect their school board members. This too is a
nightmare, a political train wreck waiting to happen. This would do
nothing but uproot and replace and already stable system. The voters of
Wake County have stated over and over again that they are please with
the way they elect their school board officials. And they see this as
another attempt by Republicans to ensure that they will always have a
majority of members on the school board in power. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Amy Wammel, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the
chance to speak. My name is Amy Wammel, and I'm a parent and concerned
citizen. I live in Carey. Senate Bill 325 flies in the face of good
governance. It would allow school board districts to be redrawn, without
the required census, in an effort to choose voters. It would also
subvert the will of the voters by lengthening the term of some board
members and lengthening the terms of others, such as Mr. Tadesco. This
bill would also pit an in the beltline district against the suburbs. How
is that good for our county? Senate Bill 325 will only bring more chaos
to this county, and on its face it appears to be politically payback for
ending the choice assignment plan and firing Mr. Tada. Perhaps you've
heard the choice plan worked, and it did for some people, yet for many
it was an abject failure. Here's a bit of what happened. There were
literally upwards of 300 families a day for several weeks spending hours
waiting to register their children. Many of these were families of low
income status who had to take off of work. Families who had just moved
to the area were told their children could not attend with the other
neighborhood kids. At least in past reassignments children were
reassigned with the neighborhood cohort. Hundreds of families didn't get
a choice in the first round. Realtors were not able to sell homes, not
to mention the busing debacle. Currently, this year, our buses are
traveling an extra 10,000 miles a day at a cost of an extra two million
dollars for Wake County taxpayers because of the choice plan. Our
current board has worked so hard to honor families' cries for stability.
They have returned to base assignment and implemented a stay where you
start policy. Senate Bill 325 will disrupt these efforts at stability
and return chaos to our system. Please rethink this bill it is very bad
business. It is very bad for business in Wake County. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Chris Fray. Brian Anderson. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Chairman, good
afternoon, my name is Brian Anderson. I'm a 15 year resident of Raleigh,
at 109 West Acott. So that all of you here may know me a little bit
better, let me start off by saying I am a vice president of a financial
services firm, here in town. I'm also a Marine Corps reserve officer
with three combat tours. My wife is a small business owner that is
thriving with six employees. Politically we would probably describe
ourselves as fiscally conservative.</p>

<p id="20:00">
So I'm thinking that a smaller government is generally a better
government. However, I am here before you today because I fear for the
long-term health of our county and our state. This current legislative
session is rapidly becoming a debacle. Where to start? Joe Bryan's plan
to essentially nationalize our school district. How is this such an
urgent and rushed matter to this state when the North Carolina
Association of County Commissioners didn't even have this as one of
their top 50 priorities until the very last day. And even then, it's not
even in their top five. Heck, even the normally silent Greater Raleigh
Chamber has come out and said that this is bad for business. This is
forcibly taking power from those at the local level and giving said
power to the state, and it reminds me of something that Hugo Chavez
would do. Mr. Hunt, Senator Hunt, where are you sir? You are the sponsor
of this bill. Dorothea Dix, do you really wish to revoke a signed and
legally binding contract because you simply don't like it? Sounds a lot
like Cyprus. The UDO and revamping and modernizing development codes.
Literally tens of thousands of man hours, put by nationally recognized
planning experts, have gone into this. And we wanna throw that out?
Representative Dollar, this is your bill. Don't overreach in this
session. If you do overreach, what will happen is what happened with
President Clinton and Obama in their first terms. And I warned some of
you about that. Don't let this become spite. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Robert Segall, please? [SPEAKER CHANGES]Good afternoon. My name
is Robert Segall and I've lived in Wade County since 2002. There's been
much discussion focusing on the dirty politics of Bill S325. And the
politics are dirty, nullifying an election by the citizens of Wade
County. What has been lost in the talk about S325 is its effect on the
children of Wade County. Their parents spoke loud and clear in the
election of 2011, voting for stability and continuity in school
assignments. Wade County parents also spoke loud and clear that we do
not want schools of poverty with high concentrations of under performing
students. We want the stability of a base school system and choice. The
2011 election was also a vote to restore Wade County Schools to the
shining beacon that it was, a school system where all children receive a
good education, not a school system of haves and have nots. Forcing a
new election is disruptive to the assignment plan currently being worked
on by the Board, and to the students and their parents. It's also
dragging Wade County back to the bad old days where the community was
divided. Now it's being done on the slick, with extralegal if not
illegal gerrymandering and ad hoc elections when results don't suit the
current power brokers. If there are to be new elections, at the very
least, let an outside nonpartisan board draw the district boundaries, or
get competing plans and see which is the fairest and most cost
effective. Unless, of course, the state's legislature wants to force all
the majority school board members into one district. Perhaps you want to
send them to Guantanamo. No one is fooled by S325. This bill will bring
back negative national publicity to Wade County. The citizens will fight
just as hard as we did to win the last election. I respectfully ask the
state Legislator to play by the rules of fairness, withdraw or defeat
S325, and keep Wade County Schools that shining beacon. Thank
you.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Tayon Danzig. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Hello, I am Tayon
Dancy, a concerned mother and a Wade County taxpayer. And while I have
your ear, I wanna speak on a different bill that was recently filed. I
urge you to vote No on the Senate Bill 361, the Excellent Public Schools
Act of 2013, sponsored by Senator Berger. This bill introduces a form of
performance-based compensation that encourages competition as opposed to
the effective collaboration that is needed to create a better
educational environment for our children. With the old saying, it takes
a village, I am reminded that in order for all of our schools to be
successful, everyone has to work together, and not in competition to
produce higher performance results. In a school system already impacted
by low teacher compensation, our pay system should focus on creating pay
equity to the job responsibility teachers are already performing to
teach the future leaders of America. Senate Bill 361 also introduces a
new plan to grade our public schools A through F. I am reminded of a
book I read as a young child, The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel
Hawthorne. In this book, the main character, a woman named Hester, has
an affair, and as a result, a child is born. Because of her wrongdoing,
Hester is required to wear the scarlet letter A. When her child, Pearl,
was born, by default she also became the scarlet</p>

<p id="25:00">
Please wait, delegation.  I charge you, do not allow our schools to
become recipients of scarlet letters. Do not allow my child, your child,
or any of our children in Wade County to become cast out by default
because of the derived grade of the school. Lastly, I urge you to find
better ways to manage size in the Wade County School system.  If
students and teacher ratios continue to increase, our teachers will have
a harder time teaching to the student rather than to the test.  There is
a difference. Senator Burger’s bill will push us to weed out the
teachers that teach because they have a passion for the field, but not
because of equitable pay. The bill will also leave our children strapped
with the shame of wearing a scarlet letter for all to see. Put Senate
Bill 361 to rest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. John Reeder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon.  My name is John Reeder and I am here this afternoon
representing myself. I’m here to speak against the passage of Senate
Bill 325 and Senate Bill 236. However, most of my remarks will apply to
325. This bill will result in the general assembly overturning the 2011
school board election in that it will take 17 terms of the people
elected in 2011 and add nine months to the terms of those elected in
2009. The Senate sponsors of 325, Senator Hunt and Senator Barefoot,
were asked by four of the Wade County commissioners to draft and pass
this bill because I feel the present board has made decisions for which
they strongly disagree. I believe the dismissal of Superintendent ?? was
their final straw and now they want retribution. The decision on how our
school members are elected should be a local issue. As the Raleigh
Chamber of Commerce pointed out last week, maybe we should look at
revising the districts and making some at large. But that is not an
issue for the General Assembly. Hundreds of people worked hard in 2011
to get people elected that had the experience in school board issues to
serve on the board. It was a partisanal action, yes, because of the way
the GOP made it partisan in 2009, in which they helped to elect
candidates that wanted to use the school board as a stepping stone for
further political ambitions. As it has been stated many times, this bill
is simply a power grab and an attempt to put GOP board members in
control again. The district’s maps were redrawn in 2011 at the budgeted
cost of $35,000 by the Shanahan Law Firm. In closing, how much
soul-searching has been done in the past by the national GOP after
losing elections they thought they should have won in November 2012?
Governor Bobby Gendel of Louisiana has been quoted as saying, “the GOP
needs to stop being the stupid party”. Is that the final warning? I’m
sorry. Our new Lieutenant Governor Forrest used to campaign,
Run Forrest, Run” for his slogan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Reeder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate that.  John Gilbert.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had the privilege of serving on the school
board for 16 years during the 80s and 90s. I’m here today to speak
against the two bills that concern the schools. What I’m especially
concerned about is the partisanship. Both these bills are transparently
partisan. That’s clear to anybody that’s paying attention at all. The
pity is that we went until 2009 with a board that was not only nominally
partisan, but was actually non-partisan. Now there was many of us on the
board who were partisan, but we didn’t bring our partisanship to the
board.  It never happened.  There was never a single vote taken by the
board until after the 2009 election in which the board split along
partisan lines. Not one. If you want some hard evidence that after the
2009 election, a number of almost all the living former school board
members met and petitioned the board, all the members of the board, to
back away from the partisanship. There were many former Republican
members, as well as Democratic members, involved.  My God.</p>

<p id="30:00">
Look at it. There were 8 people who served as chairman of the board
during that period of time. Now you know everybody who runs for any kind
of board thinks they have what it takes to be chairman, so those are
part, those are split votes, but they weren't split on partisan lines.
There were four republican chairman and three democratic chairman, I
don't know what Mary Gentry's registration was. I never had reason to
think about it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Gilroy. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Beverly Clark. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Bring that down. Greetings. I
come before you today as a former member of the Wake County, the
non-partisan Wake County Board of Education. At least during my 10 years
of service we treated every issue as a non-partisan issue. For both
democrats and republicans the primary concern was always how do we make
our students, our schools and our community strong and successful. Your
proposals to change the district lines and to change the building
process curiously fail to meet that standard of making our students,
schools and community stronger and more successful. Instead you are
bringing, returning, chaos and upheaval when our community desperately
needs and wants stability. First as to district representation.
Seriously. The districts were redone two years ago by republican Keenan
Chanahan. Wake County was the only school district in the state that
actually paid an outside political consultant, as has been mentioned he
was paid between $35 and $40 thousand instead of using the free proposal
that was prepared by the nonpartisan league of women voters. So now
having already just paid $40 thousand you want to do it again. I'm a
fiscal conservative and that is a waste of taxpayer money. Besides being
gerrymandered and overtly partisan. I brought to you today copies and
I'll share them with the members of the delegation, this is what the
current, Mr. Shanihan's districts look like. They're fairly compact.
This is what the districts look like now. They go from Briar Creek Mall
over there to the intersection for going to Selma. It's a totally
gerrymandered. Just how gerrymandered? Lacey Elementary is across the
street from Martin Middle, but in Senator Hunt's bill they don't have
the same School Board member. Daniels is not in the same district as
Braughton. Lacey is in the same district with Heritage Schools in Wake
Forest. Seriously, I could go on and on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Miss Clark. Perry Woods. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senators,
Representatives, for your time today. As you all know Wake County is
consistently listed as among if not the best place to live and work in
America. That didn't happen by accident. It took vision and leadership
from many of you in this room on both sides of the aisle. Many of these
bills that have been proposed recently do not build upon what made us
great, the collaboration, making prudent investments in our community
while protecting our AAA bond rating, but they threaten to destroy what
has made us great and this area is the economic engine for not only our
region, but for our entire state. On the proposed digs bill the reason
given why this lease needs to be torn up, this contract not to be
honored is because it was a shady deal, not a good deal for the state
and it doesn't do enough for mental health. Well, the governor and the
council state were constitutionally empowered to enter the deal. This
legislature had 9 years since the closing of the park to make their
wishes known before the deal was entered into. It's a good deal for the
state as far as $500 thousand a year is a far cry more than $1 a year
for 193 acres in Guilford County from the mountain to the sea trail in
Senator Berger's district or what we saw with Senator Hise. Well, a good
idea to give a community college land for $1, this is a good deal for
the state as well by making it a park we're going to generate more tax
dollars in the longrun than a one time windfall selling it, dividing it
up and selling it off. As far as the school board elections, if you
don't want it to look like a power grab, you shouldn't shorten the
democrat terms, lengthen the republican ones and have less compact
districts. When it comes to our House Bill 150, our city and counties
have passed a new comprehensive plan, a united development ordinance was
done by basically getting all the stakeholders together and we have less
strife between developers and neighborhoods in this city than we've had
in 20 years. This is going to exacerbate it. Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Woods. Colleen Sharp. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

<p id="35:00">
I'm not associated with any of the special interest groups here today
but it turns out that we all seem to agree on many of the topics.
Beginning last year with billboards and continuing this year with House
Bill 150, House Bill 120, and the Wake County School Legislation, I see
an apparent disregard for local government and bills aimed at reducing
our ability to vote to our local government to determine what is best
for us and our communities. If a community wants to enact strict zoning
regulations that include esthetics let them. If people want to move
there they will, if not they won't. Apparently it hasn't slowed down.
Cary, Carey's growth, in all of these years it hasn't slowed down growth
in Charlotte and other areas of this state. House Bill 150 also
unnecessarily undoes local districts created at the request of citizens,
citizens who have not asked for these legislative changes. At a minimum
I'd urge the bill to be rewritten to protect existing districts that
have been clearly created and approved by the community to protect
specific neighborhoods, such as with Raleigh's Neighborhood Conservation
District. We also expect our local governments to provide services to
protect our health and safety and that includes living in homes that are
well made and safe. House Bill 120 is another attempt to weaken local
government standards. At a minimum I urge you to change the portion
regarding the frequency of housing code updates. We need to ensure that
our housing and other construction standards are always current and that
are not left to lag behind. That is a fundamental role of government to
ensure our safety and that includes the structures we all live and work
in. Local government is where we as citizens can have an impact. It's
where we can determine what is important to us and how our community
should grow. We have the ability to participate in the processes and can
make a real difference. House Bill 150 undermines my chance as a citizen
to help shape my community by unilaterally making changes to zoning
regulations that have been developed in conjunction with citizens. The
legislature is stepping into local decision making processes and undoing
the good work of people who have worked tirelessly to define their
communities. It is big government at it's worse. I ask you to vote
against House Bill 150, House Bill 120. I ask you to vote against the
pieces of legislation regarding Wake County Schools. And I ask you to
keep the Wake, I mean the ?? property lease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Ms. Sharp. Tom Rhodes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I'd like to begin by thanking the members of the
Wake County Delegation to give us this opportunity to be heard. I
realize that there are a lot more people here in the audience than have
actually signed up to speak, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't
also have an opportunity to make your opinions known as well. A little
bit earlier one of the speakers asked those people who were opposed to
the state government revoking the ?? County lease to please stand. I'd
like to also offer an equal opportunity who those of you who are in
favor of these state governments revoking the ?? county. If you would
also please stand. OK thank you, thank you. I would also since we've
also been standing and there's also a number of people here who have not
had an opportunity to be heard if you are in favor of the state
government taking over the Wake County School board in terms of
redistricting if you would please stand. OK. I see one person waving
over here. If you're against that would you please stand. OK thank you,
thank you. Please be seated. If you are in favor of the state government
taking over the terms of the Wake County School Board and lengthening
the terms of some and shortening the terms of others would you please
stand if you're in favor. Would you please stand if you are against
that. OK thank you. My time is up. I would just remind the delegation
that we are your voters and we are activist as well. That's why we're
here today. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Rhodes. Greg Flynn please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Greg Flynn. I'm an architect by profession.
I research public policy. I've been a builder. I have a child in Wake
public schools. For six years  I reviewed school construction plans for
the State Department of Public Instruction. By statute each school
project must be reviewed for conformity with facility guidelines of
these State Board of Education. I was the editor of the most recent
addition and author of several revisions. I found the Wake County school
staff to be among the most competent in their guidance to designers
among the most comprehensive. They're proactive in avoiding surprises
and delays and despite the large size of their projects they're
relatively error free.</p>

<p id="40:00">
I think that the construction process is so accessible that it falls
prey to what I call the Bob Villa syndrome.  That any problem can be
constructed over the weekend with a few tools, a credit card, and little
skill.  Good school buildings are like finely tuned instruments, well
suited to the task of supporting our teachers, and imparting to our
children not just knowledge but wisdom, and the skills to reach their
maximum potential.  Our best schools do not supply just a collection of
rooms and corridors and durable materials, nor are they palaces.   Our
was struck one time when a designer told me he was instructed to design
an ugly school because county commissioners didn't want to waste money
on design, quote-unquote.  Good schools don't have to cost a lot of
money but they do require knowledge and wisdom of experienced people who
can navigate the path from curriculum to certificate of occupancy.  We
don't need more fingers in the pie, we don't need a bigger pie, we just
need a better pie.  Tax reform with stable revenues.  In boom time, when
the market increases prices, and now would be a great time to build
schools, but no local bonds have been issued in the last 5 years.  And
corporate tax revenue for the capital fund is being diverted to other
uses.  The lottery money has gone to debt services.  this leaves school
construction in the hands of its professional stewards and the folks on
providing stable revenue.  School construction is dead on the water.  We
don't need to argue about who's steering, we need to get going.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Flynn.  Daniel Kaitis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Good afternoon.  I'm a North Carolina native, and
husband, father of 3 kids in Wake county public schools.  I'm here today
as chairman of Wake Up Wake County.  And as an organization of thousands
of members, we've chosen to focus our efforts in 3 areas, education,
water resource, and transit and land use.  Needless to say, we have been
very busy lately.  Most of you know that Forbes magazine recently
decided that with a growth rate of 47.8% since 2000, Raleigh MSA has
been the fastest growing area in the country over the last decade.  What
a great testament to the wonderful attributes we have to offer, and what
a great responsibility this growth brings.  I am here before my county's
elected officials as chairman of an organization that devotes itself to
representing  a large portion of our community, and hopes of balancing
the influences of money and politics in our system of politics.  And it
is in this vein that we cannot be more concerned for the future of our
region.  As our elected officials, we place an enormous amount of trust
and faith in each of you to represent us in a fair and receptive manner
as you see fit.  Do we expect to agree with every decision you make?
No.  Do we hop that you exercise this legislative power with respect and
appreciation that we have placed upon you?  Absolutely.  Distrust and
gridlock plague our nation today.  It is quite concerning that recent
action, taken at the state level seems to reflect the national
sentiment, rather than the local successes and rich history this state
has in its fair and representative government.  We did not become the
envy of so many by simply taking our marching orders from DC, or one
party's well being over another.  We flourished on our own, with our own
agenda and priorities for all of North Carolina, and quite frankly, we
are better than that.  Wake Up Wake County works hard to promote the
local citizens voice and opinions in our community, and the recent
actions from the General Assembly feel more like Big Brother than a
representing and respectful governing body.  The pace at which these
last few weeks have been unfolding have been alarming, the implications
that local citizens and communities are incapable of determining what is
in their best interest is nothing short of offensive and disrespectful.
We all deserve better.  I'm not a fool, we are not fools, and I know
none of you are foolish either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Kaitis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]What do you say we all stop treating each other as
such.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Kaitis.  John Adeo?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, my name is John Adeo, I'm representing
myself and my 2 children.  Lacy Elementary school.  6 years ago, my
company, on executive relocation program, asked me to move back to the
United States since living overseas.  We went through an exhaustive
criteria.  Community, quality of life, and most important, education.
We chose Raleigh, simply and most importantly because of the quality of
education.  In the last 2 years there have been too many changes and
uncertainly added to the education program here in Raleigh.  as elected
officials, we put our trust in you.  We put our faith in your ability to
make these decisions.  Unfortunately, these decisions lately have not
been in respect to what we are looking for in our elected officials.
Quite frankly, SB-325 does not meet the community standards which we
accept, the quality of life, and most importantly, the education for our
children.  On another matter, and recently Senator Hunt's</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Bowers. Harvey Richmond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for providing this opportunity to address the Wake County
Delegation. My name's Harvey Richmond and I'm a 20 year resident of
Cary. I'm speaking today on behalf of the Capital Group of the Sierra
Club, which has about 3,000 members living in Wake, Johnson, Lee, Moore,
Granville, and Cumberland Counties. My remarks today will address two
issues. One, the misguided effort to derail the Dix Park deal and two,
the legislator's attempt to meddle in local affairs by prohibiting local
governments from withholding building permits based on builder's design
elements. With respect to the effort to reverse the legal deal made
between the state of North Carolina, as ratified by the Governor and the
Council of State and City of Raleigh, I strongly urge our entire Wake
County Delegation to oppose this effort. The agreement reached to lease
the land to Raleigh for the purposes of creating a flagship park has
been debated for eight years and I believe has the support of the
majority of Wake Count citizens, as you've heard today. Great cities
have great parks and Raleigh, our capital city, needs this park not more
apartments or commercial building on the Dix site. The alternative of
allocating 200 acres that are in a flood plain is plainly inadequate.
With respect to the second issue, House Bill 150, I find it surprising
that a conservative-led General Assembly is advocating moving control
over an area that is usually reserved for local governments, they want
to move it to the state level. Communities should continue to have the
right to impose stricter or additional standards that go beyond the bare
minimum. The state has no business regulating what local governments
pass in the way of building codes, especially ones that enhance the
visual appearance of our neighborhoods and/or improve energy efficiency
or safety. Mayors and other elected officials in Wake County including
democrats, republicans, independents, have all spoken out against this
bill. In Wake County, which you are supposed to be representing, housing
sales and building construction are up precisely in places that have
additional requirements. People want quality construction not the bare
minimum. Step up and listen to your constituents, not the building
industry who mainly care about profits not healthy and great
communities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Richmond. Patti Williams?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good evening, my name is Patti Williams. I want to thank you for the
opportunity to comment about what I believe is about the most
undemocratic and unconstitutional piece of legislation I can imagine.
I'd like to start off by reminding everyone what former First Lady
Barbara Bush said after a candidate she endorsed lost an election,
&quot;People spoke, move on, get on with it. I want to do other things
and not to be ugly.&quot; In 2011, then Wake School Board Chair Ron
Margiotta paid Kieran Shanahan to redraw school board district lines
after the 2010 census. Many voters were moved more than necessary to
balance the population in each district. Some districts were made more
partisan and then other districts voting precincts were split, adding
cost and confusion for voters in that election. The people spoke, Mr
Margiotta lost his bid for reelection. I thought we had moved on but the
newly proposed Senate Bill 325 effectively undoes the results of the
2011 Wake County School Board election. Now Senators Hunt and Barefoot
have proposed to remove the authority to redraw School Board District
boundaries from the local Board of Education in violation of state
statute, redraw the School Board districts again, placing several
current board members in the same district when the state statute says
you can't redraw district lines unless you have a new census, cut short
the terms of five board members and extend the terms of four others,
create two at-large seats adding tens of thousands of dollars to the
cost to run an effective county-wide campaign. The high cost of
campaigning would exclude many from running. Moreover, electing our
school board by district allows each board member to establish
relationships with principle, staff, students, and their families at a
subset of our 169 schools. Representation by district enables greater
accountability and more effective advocacy and problem solving. This is
purely a political move. It's not coming from citizens but from
overzealous, power hungry elected officials who didn't like the outcome
of the 2011 school board election. Let's move on, let's get on with it.
There are four school board seats up for election in October, find good
candidates, and may the best people win.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Williams. Barbara Vandenbergh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My name is Barbara Vandenbergh. I am a retired Wake County
schoolteacher and a parent of two sons who got an excellent education in

feel we do not need Senate Bill 325. These school board districts were
re-drawn in 2011 after the U.S. Census</p>

<p id="55:00">
before the last school board election to change the election process is
an unwise use of tax dollars at a time when you are advocating
conservative budgeting. We have paid for this once why should we pay for
it again? Senator Hunt argues that this bill will give voters greater
choice because they get to vote for two board of education members.
Seventy percent of the residents of Wake county do not have children in
school and of the remaining 30 percent a very small percentage of
families have children in multiple districts we would be spending this
money for a small fraction of the citizens. We do not need this bill.
However, if that is the model that you choose than when can we expect
legislation that will give us a chance to vote for two senators? We do
not need this bill. In summary I'm sure you object to the Federal
government dictating to states how to govern. I urge you to be
consistent and do not dictate to wake county how we run our school
system. This is a example of big government not sensible government. We
do not need this bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ??
Stephanie Goslin Charles Ridder I'm sorry I didn't see you [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It's alright. My name is Stephanie Goslin and I come here to
speak on behalf of the state honoring its contracts. The state if the
state were to renege on this contract it sets a very dangerous
precedent. If you were if you set this precedent what would prevent the
state from being able to renege on any of its future contracts? If the
party comes into power if a new party comes into power what would
prevent them from reneging on contracts this legislature enters into.
Who will be willing to do the business with the state in the future? Are
you willing to take that chance? and the argument that the state is
doing this in support of mental health is erroneous if that were true
they would be expanding the medicaid program. Which brings me to the
other reason I come before you. I recently gone on disability and did
you know that a person that has disability has to resign their position
with their employer thus giving up medical benefits and if you are on
disability you have to be on disability for two years before medicare
will kick in. My one thousand four hundred and seventy five dollars per
month puts me over the amount that you can make before medicaid kicks
in. I am sure that how many people that are disabled can go two years
without seeing a doctor. I urge the legislature to expand the medicaid
program and as a United States tax payer I don't understand why I have
to pay for other states to expand their medicaid programs while we are
foregoing expanding ours. Finally the hospitals would also appreciate
the expansion of the medicaid program they would be best paid for the
low income population that is filling up their E R rooms. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mrs. Goslin. Charles Ridder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon my name is Charles Ridder from ?? and I
am here to urge t he Wake county delegation to stop SB76 what this bill
does it preapproves what the mining and energy commission is doing they
are coming up with quote safety guidelines and by preapproving it by
eliminating the legislature from having final approval is like signing a
blank check so we don't know what we are going to get. It also does alot
of other nasty things including eliminating the North Carolina State
Geologist from mining and energy commission and fracking is allowed it
will contaminate the drinking water in Wake county and I'd like to show
this and I have handouts here. I don't know ?? delegation. This is quick
fracking allows the use of carcinogens Halliburton loophole goes into
the shale. The shale intersects the water table in Chatham county that
intersection is about two to five miles from Jordan lake. When you
contaminate Jordan lake those carcinogens will come out of your faucet.
So there is a path there and the only issue is not if it will happen but
when it will happen.</p>

issues.  First, senate bill 334, house bill 319, which would break the
contract, between the state and the city of Raleigh, for a park on
Dick’s Campus.  Really… maybe it’s something that not every legislature
likes, but it’s a decision made by our city council on behalf of it’s
citizens, and they have a valid legal contract with the state.  To
intervene is to set a precedent, that says laws come and go, every time
we have an election.  That is a very scary prospect to me.  Not to
mention that a park, envisioned by the far-sighted leaders of this
effort, would bring jobs and money to our state, and a steady stream of
funds for mental health services.  So I’m confused… even if you’d simply
as an economic development strategy, why would you not support this
park?  In fact, why aren’t you actively advocating for it?  Secondly,
senate bill 325, a bill to overturn our most recent school board
election… again, why?  Because the candidates who won were Democrats?
It’s pretty difficult to read this bill and not see retribution all over
it… a petty and un-admirable motive.  Surely we should have the
expectation that when we elect someone to the local office that that
person is not going to be imprudently removed by you.  I looked at the
definition of conservative in the dictionary, and I wondered who had
really been elected… it was defined as, “tending or to maintain existing
views, conditions, or institutions, and marked by moderation or
caution.”  I’m not seeing any of those things from you…  So I urge you
to consider Samuel Johnson’s advice, “to push advantages too far, is
neither generous, or just.”

state and county seriously, as I'm sure all of you do. That is why I'm
here to share with you my grave concern about Senate Bill 325, and my
great disappointment with Senator Hunt's and Senator Barefoot's
sponsorship of this bill. New School Board district lines were redrawn
by a Republican majority on the School Board for the 2011 election.
Many, many people of all political stripes worked long hours to ensure
that the political process during that election was fair and somewhat
uncomplicated for the voting public in Wake County. We had a fair and
open School Board election. The people voted, and they had their say. To
now throw out the results of that election and once again redraw new
district lines and have a new special election is costly, and is frankly
undemocratic. If people need more representation in their school
district, let's talk about it. Let's have the School Board sponsor more
public forums and listen to their concerns. This is a Wake County School
Board issue, not a state government issue. Our School Board was legally
and fairly elected to govern Wake County's public schools system. It's
time to concentrate on the needs and challenges of the children in Wake
County, and to support the people who were legally elected on the School
Board by the citizens of Wake County. I respectfully ask you to rethink
your sponsorship of this bill, and ask you to seriously think about the
implications, the expense, the loss of good will, and maybe even the
loss of future revenue that will be generated by this bill. Please allow
our School Board to do the job that they were elected to do. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Ms. Boose. Tina Govan. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
One good thing about all this is the level of civil engagement that you
see happening right now. You've thrown cold water in the face of North
Carolina, and we are awake. It was Ronald Reagan who said the government
was beholden to the people. He believed in our capacity for
self-government, not representatives in a, quote, far distant capitol
who think they can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them
ourselves. It applies to the state just as strongly as it does to the
Federal Government. Local control, governance, and representation. I
thought you believed in that. Why, then, are you meddling in the affairs
of Wake County? What does the rest of North Carolina have to fear from
you? Are you planning to redraw the school district boundaries and
arbitrarily terminate the terms of school board members in all the other
North Carolina counties as well? It's disenfranchisement pure and
simple. We're back to taxation without representation. Never in my life
have I had my vote undone by kicking out elected officials. Shame on
you, Neal Hunt. Gerrymandering district lines to win elections for your
own party is a shameful, undemocratic practice. It should be illegal.
It's about maximizing votes for your own team and disenfranchising
everybody else. It's not representative government. People should choose
their representatives, not the other way around. Many states use an
independent nonpartisan commission to draw district lines, with
regulations limiting participation by elected officials. It's time for
us to do this. Enough with this selfish, never-ending messing around
with district lines. I want to ask you, what is the state? There is no
one place called North Carolina. The state is cities and town. North
Carolina thrives only when local places thrive. Why are you trying to
steal authority away from them? It's the city and county governments
that are closest to the people. In North Carolina everywhere, people are
trying to build stronger communities and make where they live a better
place. What works for people in Asheville may not work in ?? Hall. Here
in Raleigh, we've worked hard for the UDO and to put the ?? and elect
school board members who represent them. Respect that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Govan. Melanie Taylor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like all
of the Wake County delegation to raise their hands. I want to see them
high. I'm a retired school teacher, if you can't tell. Today my purpose
is to pose some thoughtful comments about a number of issues, not
provide a litany of statistics. I'm sure facts and numbers will be
covered by others. As the old song goes, change, it's been a long time
coming. So I understand why it's necessary for the current majority to
undo what was done by previous lawmakers. Let's take away local control
of our municipalities and schools and put them in the hands of
lawmakers, for Heaven's sake, on the state level yet. Put</p>

School teachers all notice they may not have a job that long and they're
not going to be paid much anyway. Take away unemployment benefits, allow
Senators Pate and Tucker to use treatment of the mentally ill as a smoke
screen - as a smoke screen to avoid a lawful contract for a [part] which
benefits all of the state. Above all let's do away with diversity and
put up road blocks to voting for the poor, the old, minorities when no
real fraud exists. It's time to resurrect the poll tax and the
Grandfather clause. If we continue all of this undoing, maybe we can
return to 1719 - history teacher here [laughter] - when the Carolina
Colony was divided into North and South Carolina. After all, when all
this undoing is complete, we'll just be another South Carolina, Georgia
and Mississippi. For heavens sakes they save us most of the time. I'm
just trying to light a candle in the darkness so that our lawmakers in

window dressing so that you can go ahead and undo what you are going to
undo all along.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Miss Taylor [APPLAUSE]. Let's keep it
moving, thank you. Mary Marjorela please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. I am Mary Marjorela, chair of the
League of Women voters of Wake County. I am here today to advocate for
responsible government. A recent proposal from the Wake County Board of
Commissioners, followed by a similar proposal from the North Carolina
legislature, is causing us great concern. Senate Bill 325 would change
the election district boundaries, the terms of office, and the way in
which Wake County school board members are elected. Wake's commissioners
had asked that a majority of school board members be elected at large
instead of representing single districts. The League believes all of
these actions and proposals defy principles of democracy. They thwart
transparency in government, citizen participation, equity in
representation, and bring arbitrary changes for terms and districts of
previously elected officials. Transparency in government requires
explanations for why suggested radical changes are desirable. Time for
discussion and opportunity for input. These are necessary for informed
citizen participation. We do not have explanations of why the need for
thee changes is called for at this time, and it appears there will be
limited time for consideration of the consequences. Following the census
of 2010, school districts in Wake County were modified by the
appropriately assigned bodies, with some attention to equity and
representation, to bring the districts into conformity with the
consensus. Now the legislature, after the fact of this revision, is
without explanation planning to take the role of drawing new districts,
and completely revising the composition in terms of the members of the
Wake County school board. We ask that the Wake County delegation
withhold it's approval of SB325, so that any changes in methods of
election reflect citizen input, previously mandated government
processes, and thoughtful legislative study. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Gail Wisener, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for listening. I'm a realtor, and I've lived
in North Carolina since 1994. Lived and loved it. My husband is a
psychologist. So we are both very interested in development issues in
the area. We are both very interested in mental health issues. My
husband actively works in politics as well, defending the rights of
North Carolinians and protecting the rights of mental health. And those
two things are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A study was made - or
several studies were made - to show how we could benefit both. When I
was a kid I grew up in New Orleans, and we were poor. And we spent many
hours in City Park, which is a fabulous park in the middle of New
Orleans and I think it rivals City Park, though not as large. Kids of
all ages play there. Companies have their picnics there. There's a
beautiful museum in the middle of it. But there's not an office, or God
forbid a condo, in sight. It is a jewel. And it has been for many, many
years. It continues to be an asset. Because somebody, somewhere had the
foresight to think ahead. They weren't in a hurry to do anything and
everything they could to make their mark.</p>

result, as a result of that. Making all kinds of decisions willy-nilly,
that are going to affect the health and welfare of the citizens in North
Carolina for decades to come. Some of this can't be undone, folks. Some
of these decisions you're making are extremely serious, and we school
kids learned when we were little that there were great leaders like
Theodore Roosevelt, who was instrumental in creating federal parks, and
we remember him for the good that he did. But you know what? We studied

CHANGES] Mr. Chairman and members of the Wake County Delegation, my name
is Anita Earls. Together with Allison Riggs, we represent several Wake
County voters who are dedicated to fair elections for Wake County
schools. And I'm here today to oppose senate bill 325. I have written
comments which I hope that you will take into account that go into more
detail. But basically my clients oppose this bill because it is
fundamentally unfair. It is highly disruptive and against the other
expressions of public policy that we have in the law, to redistrict
again without some kind of legal mandate. The current districts have not
been found to be unconstitutional or violate the Voting Rights Act. We
don't have two school board systems that are merging. There's no legal
reason why there needs to be a redistricting at this time. It's also
unusual to consider this change against the wishes of the current board.
It's highly unusual to consider this change without public input,
without a chance for the public to give their views on whether or not
they think it's necessary. And the only explanation we've, non-partisan
or non-political explanation we've heard, that parents want to be able
to vote, that they may send their kids to a school in a different
district than the one that they live in, that they vote in, isn't
explained by the provisions of the bill itself, and I go into more
detail on that in my letter. Legally, you might note that the eastern
half of the two district part of the plan, the eastern half of District
A actually follows the same lines as Senate District 14, which is
currently being challenged in litigation in state court on a number of
grounds. The districts are non-compact. The deviations are beyond what
current districts have, leading to unfair vote dilution of urban voters.
And finally, we know that there are 15,000 voters who lived in a
district in 2009 that didn't have an election, that didn't vote in 2011.
This extends until 2014, a total of seven years when they can vote. This
is bad policy, but we also think that senate bill 325 as written is
unconstitutional. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Ms. Earls. It would be
helpful if you gave the writing to the Sergeant at Arms and they will
distribute it to us. Thank you. David Diaz. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
I'm here on behalf of the Downtown Raleigh Alliance, a non-profit
organization whose mission is to continue the revitalization of downtown
Raleigh. Downtowns are the heart and soul of our towns and cities. Every
town in North Carolina shows its pride in its community through the
success of revitalizing their downtown. Dorothea Dix's proximity to
downtown means that any plans for developing it could directly undermine
the recent success of downtown Raleigh. Any Dix plan should complement
and not undermine the investments that have been made by the city of
Raleigh, Wake County, and the state of North Carolina, to revitalize
North Carolina's downtown. We urge the legislature to not support this
bill, bills 319 and 334. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Diaz. Mike Lindsay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to thank the Wake County
Delegation for this opportunity to speak. And also thank you for your
service to our county and to our state. My name is Michael Lindsay. I'm

me. I live in one of the best neighborhoods, in one of the best cities
in America. You may or may not know about my neighborhood, yet last week
the legislature voted to eliminate building guidelines for beautiful
Cameron Park. Something we spent years developing, the legislature voted
to eliminate without even knowing the details. Surely state government
doesn't know Cameron Park better than its own residents. Now I hear this
same top down approach is going to be applied to the Wake County school
system. A system with a great national reputation, is now going to have
something fixed that isn't broken. And finally, why is state government
preparing to go back on its word? After years of work, the city of
Raleigh and the state signed agreement to lease the remaining land of

To the city for a future park. Raleigh will pay the state well over $68
million in the course of 75 years. Yet it isn’t good enough for the
sponsor of the bill to revoke Raleigh’s lease. This same man, however,
sponsored a bill that gave a $2 million prison to the local people for a
dollar. As a pro-business, independent voter, I am stunned at all this
ill-conceived legislation. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Burham. Steve
Church. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. My name is Steve Church and
I’m an advocate for Dorothea Dix Hospital. The reason we’re here today
is that past or present political leaders have conveniently framed the
conversation on Hicks to be about real estate opportunities rather than
the mentally ill. They knew that mental health was not a topic that
people would rally around but a park would be. Judging from the comments
so far, their deception has worked brilliantly. Dix’s closing was an act
of evil toward the mentally ill but it took good men and women to do
nothing, doing nothing to achieve it. The influential people with money
and a vision, patiently waiting for Dix to be of no further use to North
Carolina so they could take it over without any remorse. The media for
the most part has allowed most of this to take place. Media outlets like
the ?? observer and WRAL had a long-term vested interest in Dix’s
defunding so their own visions for the land could be realized. We can
only honor Dorothea Dix by once again promoting mental health care as a
primary source for this property. The Reverend Martin Luther King once
said, quote, “Our lives begin to end when we become silent about things
that matter.” So before you begin to feel too sorry for business leaders
up in arms about binding contracts, Republicans in charge who oppose the
deal like it is now are park advocates who want all the property. Please
take a moment to reflect on those who cannot fend for themselves. Only
they have a legitimate right to honestly show shock and outrage over Dix
?? takeover, no matter the outcome. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you very much, Mr. Church. Shane Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi. Thanks
for letting me speak today. I’m Shane Collins and I just want to talk
about three things today. Parks, jobs and money. I came here in 2001
from Colorado. I turned down a job at UC Boulder. There’s a lot of parks
in Boulder. Well, in Colorado. And I turned down a job in Boulder to
come to Raleigh because there was a better job in Raleigh. But then I
found out there were other things in Raleigh and the surrounding area.
Notably parks. Parks, people, jobs and money. And so I bought a house.
There were no parks nearby but there was NCState, which became
Centennial Campus. And now there’s a park and a house, my first house in
Raleigh, that’s going on up ?? Drive. The city has approved that park,
and they’re working with the community to establish a park there. My
next house was on Lake Johnson, which is a beautiful park, enjoyed by
students, by seniors, and by young children and they’re looking to
expand that park. My third house is in North Raleigh, near ?? another
park off of Quail Hollow, I’m sorry I forget the name. It’s off Quail
Hollow Drive. And so the parks have been big decision-makers for me in
getting property, and buying property and maintaining property in this
area. And what I would like to do would be to encourage the delegation
to consider the importance of parks, the importance of jobs, and the
importance of people need for money. Because parks generate value, and
that’s very important in home ownership and in purchasing property in
areas. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Collins. Lois Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. I’m Lois Dixon. I live in Carey. And I
am speaking in opposition to Senate Bill 325. I’m an unaffiliated voter,
and I believe strongly that public education should be non-partisan
issue. It is the most important thing we do and the foundation of our
responsibilities as a society. And by the way, Wake County is divided
almost evenly between Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters at
about 30-40% each.</p>

<p id="85:00">
I have three points among many that illustrate that this Bill is
inferior to current legislation.  First, the current districts that were
just revised and paid for by the Republican-lead Board of Education are
compact and reasonable and give each municipality a designated Board
representative, but the map, excuse me, but the map showing districts
proposed in this Bill are loopy like a can of worms without clear
representation for any community.  This maps puts 9 of the 12
municipalities between two districts, carves Raleigh into six of the
seven districts and splits twenty-one precincts, which would be
confusing I'm sure.  Board of Education, secondly, Board of Education
advisory councils which mean on a regular basis with their district
board member will now be required with these districts to drive from one
end of the county to another for their meetings.  This will break the
local connection and the sense of responsibility of board members to the
schools and neighborhoods they represent in their districts.  Third,
holding the election with the 2014 primary election when each party
selects its partisan candidates, sends a clear signal that this is no
longer a non-partisan board.  It will disenfranchise unaffiliated voters
who do not realize they too can vote in a primary election.  And
finally, I would urge the senate leadership to stop saying that our
public education system is broken.  The only thing broken about public
education is the per pupil funding, which is second from the bottom in
all fifty states.  In spite of that our students, aided by our teachers,
are outperforming the funding and posting higher achievement scores and
other measures that are better than they have ever been in the history
of North Carolina.  Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Ms. Nixon.  Jerry Ackland.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  I'm Jerry Ackland, I'm the current President of the
National Alliance on Mental Illness, Wake County, and I'm here, believe
it or not, to support Senate Bill 334.  Now you might ask why in the
world would I want to support something that doesn't support parks.  I
love parks too but what has happened is that people that  Dorothea Dix,
and her legacy left for us, is the need for taking care of the poor and
the people with mental illness.  And so, when, when the people that were
meeting in closed rooms and talking about places, about building parks
and things, guess who was left out?  Those with mental illness.  They
were left out completely in the discussion.  They were ignored, and so I
think this lease that was put together at the very last minute, in a
smoke-filled room, with all sorts of things that went on, ignored a very
important component; and because of that I want to speak up and say
something about that.  In particular, I would imagine that you don't
even know that in the very last minutes of this, this debate, more land
was given away to one of the property leasee's, the Healing Place, did
you know that?  Your sign that says Dix 306, it's not 306 anymore, it's
less than that already.  Golly gee, things happen that you probably
didn't even know about.  Therefore, I'm telling you maybe we have to ask
questions of why did they happen.  Could it be that Mr. Goodman's wife
who is co-founder of the Healing Place that got the benefit of this had
some influence on the decision?  I don't know.  But why can't we have an
open and transparent society so that we can all be a part of this?
Finally, I am not going to go very far here am I?  I just ask the
delegation to open up and reconsider and think about what you can do to
compromise here and make this a better place for all of us in this
state.  Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you, Mr. Ackland.  Louise Fisher.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you, I have been a volunteer advocate for the
mentally ill for thirty-one years.  Many of you think in this room that
what is happening as far as the decisions being made about the park and
development have nothing to do with the mentally ill.  I beg to differ.
I also differ with the notion that the plight of the mentally ill is a
smokescreen.  Folks, it is real.  I wish you got the information that I
received on my car phone and some of these other people received about
people who are frantic even with small children and cannot get services,
afraid their family member will kill someone.  That's how bad our
services are.  I support both Bills that void Governor Purdue's leased
with the City of Raleigh.  The lease culminated thirty-one years of
efforts to close Dix</p>

to gain control of the property. I don't have time to give you the
history. Those efforts eroded North Carolina's failing mental health
system. Not one penny in the least is slated to go for the mentally ill.
The Dix property issue boils down to an unfair battle between the haves
and the have nots. Most park advocates have money and voice. The
mentally ill have no money and no voice. They are simply at your mercy.
The Dix property was originally donated for the sole purpose of
providing more humane treatment for our mentally ill in North Carolina,
not not for development or a park. What- why is no one concerned about
that agreement with these families? Dorothea Dix's mission was to get
the mentally ill out of prisons and into hospitals. Today we have more
mentally ill in prisons than we do in our hospitals. They've continued
to downsize the hospitals every year. I'll finish by saying, in 2000 I
attended a conference dealing with the homeless mentally ill. I'll never
forget an elderly Jewish lady who rose to her feet with tears streaming
down, and said &quot;I lived through the Nazi holocaust, these years
will go down in this country as the holocaust of the mentally ill&quot;.

I'm Hope Turlington, a Dix advocate. Start your engines. 10 years of
work in a park vs a life struggle of mental illness? What would you
choose? North Carolina, as per the Dix lease is to approve any Raleigh
plan, so we've got to say no for 99 years? So our sick could get the
care that belongs to them? What's fair? Do the park people think it's
fair to kick our sick off their deeded ground with 1.4 million they
didn't care, and the figure's population's growing higher every day? Did
you hear Dr. E. Fuller Turley on national C-Span put us on the bottom in
mental health care? Does Buttoner replace Dix' 500 bed loss along with
1300 jobs? How high will Raleigh resident taxes go, and will  Ralegh
depend on North Carolina taxpayers to pay for their park? Doesn't North
Carolina get their long awaited vote as honored? Who's to pay for
cleaning the varmint toxic dump on Dix hill from Raleigh building
projects? Who pays to raise Dix and remove toxic waste as New York
Central Park has no buildings? Why did Raleigh close parks out of 3800
if they can afford another? Can a deed of Dix Hill to care for ou sick
be ignored? Now researched and proved? Did Sen. Ham say &quot;I know no
one who deserves a view from Dix Hill better than our sick?&quot; Is it
right for our sick to wait a 6 month period in jail for a bed at
Buckner? How can sheriffs fund transport? 2 Sheriffs at the time are
patients. How can families find Buckner or afford the gas, or afford the
gas to go to  your park you're talking about? Most of North Carolina is
poor now. Is Raleigh not center of the state, and the largest population
of needing help? Sen. 334 and House bill 319 is fair to all. Please vote
for that, it's the only thing that's acknowledged we do have sick people
in the state of North Carolina. Lord please save us from this expensive
deadly trespass, and I do believe he does set the path right, not us.

[These will]. Many schools we worked on. And I see some solutions,
possibly, from a guy working from the inside out. I believe that we
should be designing smaller schools closer to neighborhoods, to create a
connected community and less bussing. That's the first thing I see. And
that protects our environment from green gasses. Second I see that we
should start looking at building innovative schools. We call ourselves
Raleigh Innovate, well let's innovate and build schools that are better
fortified, and more cost effective, and energy efficient overall. Let's
think about net zero energy so that we can save the tax payers money.
Building better schools, better fortified, using the innovation and
advances in technology we have today, could save a tremendous amount of
money for the Wake County taxpayers. And at the same time we could pay
our teachers better. So it's not all about brick or mortar. We're about
ready to spend a billion dollars or more in school construction. This
time we take the old style, copy and paste over and over the same
buildings. It's time to innovate and really look for solutions, and
maybe the Wake County could form a commission to look at the advance
technology that we have today to lessen the impact on the environment
and save the taxpayers money. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ?? thank you. I apologize once again to everyone,
and the next person in line always feels the pain the greatest. I
apologize. But we have to end it at some point and we said the meeting
would go until 6 pm. We will-- Wake delegation meets again in two weeks,
and so anyone who signed up will have an opportunity to address us then.
As the chair I just want to thank everyone for your comments today. They
were very informative, very civilly delivered and we appreciate it.
Meeting adjourned.</p>
