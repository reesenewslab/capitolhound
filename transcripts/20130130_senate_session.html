From Wednesday January 30th, 2013 the following is a replay of
voterready.com's coverage of the daily session in the North Carolina
Senate.
[Speaker Change]
Senate will come to order. The Sergeant at Arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will
please silence all your electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer
is the Reverend Peter ?? of the Senate chapel. All members and guests in
gallery will please stand.
[Speaker Change]
Please pray with me. Almighty God, you are our light, and our salvation.
Lord you have been our dwelling place from generation to generation,
grandmother, to grandfather, great grandfather, to great grandmother.
And so as we gather here today under the shelter of this building in the
hallways of centuries of law making we realize almighty lord that we're
actually underneath the sky of your grace. Many saints, many citizens,
and many senators have gathered here, they've prayed here for
protection, and for wellbeing of citizens in this state. Each of these
men and women have been sent here on a mission to represent their
constituents. Less we not forget Jesus that even in the midst of the
ceremony and sometimes even despite ourselves you are somehow leading
us. You are our guide, so lord you God are the chief cornerstone. Help
us as we pray to be given a plum line, to be given exactness, accuracy,
and direction by your perfect cornerstone. We pray in the name of Jesus,
amen.
[Speaker Change]
Amen (together)
[Speaker Change]
Senator ?? is recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. The Journal of Wednesday January 9, 2013 has
been examined and is found to be correct. I move that we dispense with
the reading of the journal and that it stand approved as written.
[Speaker Change]
Without objection, the journal for January 9th stands approved as
written. Senators if you will please note on your desk there is a
notebook filled with forms and papers on that desk that is usually
stuffed into a drawer somewhere below and it may disappear into that
drawer after today, and you may not ever see it again. But that notebook
contains forms that you will need during the session, like excused
absences, and those types of forms. So please take note of that today,
open it up, thumb through that journal, and then feel free to place it
in your drawer, but know that, that's where it will be. You will also
find a copy of the 2013 rules that you adopted on January 9th that
should be there on your desk as well. If you don't have a copy please
let somebody know and make sure that you do get that copy. Notices and
announcements. Do we have any notices and announcements?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Speaker Apodaca for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. President three announcements please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  You have the floor Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. President.  Actually there’s gonna be
four.  The first one members as we go forth in the electronic age, and
Senator Allran we go kickingly, I want to let you know that as of March
15th we’re gonna go paperless.  So, we have a couple of months to get
cranked up if need be your L.A.’s can print it up and put it in a book
for you.  But as of March 15th they’re no longer gonna be brought around
to you from the Sergeant at Arms.  In behalf of all the trees that we’re
saving, Senator Kinnaird, this is a good thing.  You’ve got a couple of
months to adjust.  I know it’s going to be difficult but we’re all here
willing to work with you on this.  The second thing, tomorrow at 10 am
room 1027 we’re gonna have our first committee meeting.  It’ll be the
insurance committee.  It’ll be emailed out to you today.  It’s gonna be
dealing with Senate Bill 4.  I think there should be quite a bit of
interest in Senate Bill 4.  It’s on the computer now and I encourage
everybody to sign on dealing with healthcare exchange.  The last item
Mr. President if I may, it’s come to my attention from the facilities
management evidently there has been a Senator or someone who has gone
into the ladies restroom over on the house side and taken some furniture
out of it.  We hope we don’t make a habit of this.  We are trying to get
the house members to learn how to use the restroom and if they don’t
have the proper things in there it’ll be difficult.  So let’s keep the
furniture where it belongs and thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Senator.  Any further notices or
announcements?  The chair would like to extend courtesies of the floor
to Senator Wes Westmoreland.  I saw the Senator in here earlier today.
Senator Westmoreland still in here.  Senator if you’ll stand please.
Thank you for your service in the State of North Carolina.  It’s good to
have you with us today.  Is there any further business to come before
the Senate?  If not, the chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. President.  Members of the Senate I’m
going to make the motion to adjourn at this time and you will note when
I make the motion that the adjournment will be until 9 am tomorrow
morning.  Our plan will be to have a skeletal session at 9:00 and then
recess until noon.  That’s a practice that we started last time towards
the end of the session.  I think it seemed to work fairly well.  I think
we’ll continue that practice beginning tomorrow.  So with that Mr.
President I move that the Senate do now adjourn in honor of the memory
of Senator Jean Preston and her service to the children of this state,
subject to the receipt of any reading of  messages from the house and
the governor, the receipt referral and re-referral of bills and the
announcement of committee appointments to reconvene on Thursday, January
31, 2013 at 9 am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Senator.  The motion’s that Senate do now
adjourn  in honor of the memory of Senator Jean Preston and her service
to the children of our state, subject to the receipt and the reading of
messages from the house and the governor, the receipt referral and
re-referral of bills and the announcement of committee appointments to
reconvene Thursday, January 31 at 9 am seconded by Senator Apodaca.  All
in favor say aye.  Opposed no.  The ayes have it and the Senate stands
adjourned.</p>
