  ?? Sergeant at arms, close the doors. Members will get to their seats.
Members and guests in the gallery, please silence all electronic
devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter Milner,
Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will please
stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us pray together. Almighty God, as we enter
into your presence we are reminded of your goodness, your majesty,
you&#39;re the giver of every good and perfect gift. Who shall climb the
mountain of the Lord? Who shall stand in the holy place? The man with
clean hands and pure heart, who desires not worthless things. Who has
not sworn so as to deceive his neighbor. And so this is our prayer, Lord
Jesus, that your glory, your light will keep us from deceiving our
neighbor, that your glory and light will transform us into people that
long to serve our neighbor in truth and righteousness. In Jesus&#39;
name I pray, Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger is recognized for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I was looking for my
note. The journal for Tuesday February 3, 2015 has been examined and
found to be correct. I move that we dispense with the reading of the
journal and that it stand approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without
objection, the journal for February 3, 2015 stands approved as written.
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually Mr. President, I was just sitting down. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Mr.
President, I move that the Senate now stand in recess, subject to the
standard stipulations set forth in Rule 24.1 and messages from the
House, to reconvene at 4:30. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, the
Senate will stand in recess until 4:30. Senator Brown, for what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Republicans will caucus during recess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;re in recess. [PAUSE] Senate will come to
order. Sergeant at arms, close the doors. Members go to their seats.
Members and guests in the gallery please silence all electronic devices.
Senators we have leaves of absence today granted for Senator Bingham. We
do have one item on our calendar today. Public Bill, second reading,
Senate Bill 14. Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 14, an
act to ?? standards, rules review, coal ash funds. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown is recognized to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I think I&#39;d refer this as a cleanup bill.
It&#39;s really three parts to the bill and I&#39;ll try to briefly go
over them. The first part transfers $100,000 from the State Board of
Education to the Office of Administrative Hearings to provide for
litigation costs of the recently filed lawsuit against the Rules Review
Commission. The second part transfers $275,000 from Department of Public
Construction to the Department Administration to cover the cost of the
Academics Standard Review Commission. This section also includes some
transparency provisions, such as putting out handouts and agendas on
website, and live streaming of the commission meetings. And finally the
final piece of the bill fixes a timing issue with the way the Coal Ash
Commission gets their money. Due to the timing of the Duke receipts
coming in, the Coal Ash Commission will not have the money it needs to
operate between now and the end of the year. So this will adjust the
appropriations language to account for this by giving the Coal Ash
Commission the money it needs to hire staff and perform other operations
that are needed of the Commission. That&#39;s pretty much what the bill
does, and I will try to answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we
have any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick has the
floor to speak to the bill.

This bill is one of those where you can prop, so we find some good. And
it&#39;s likewise one where you can see where perhaps some of the things
which you can take with the editor in my opinion are somewhat misguided.
One of the provisions here that gives me concern is the specific
provision where they talk about us spending money to go out and find
qualified experts on academic standards that will be used in alternative
to Common Core Standards. Now, that disturbs me and it disturbs me
because when it comes to these Common Core Standards we have 50 states
in the United States and what we had were 48 of the 50 states coming
together to develop Common Core Standards. What we had were the National
Governors Association coming forth with the association composed of the
superintendents of education throughout the 50 states to deliberate and
come up with standards. They employed best practices from all of the
states to see what needed to be done. They talked to school
administrators. They talked and employed experts of their own to help
develop those Common Core Standards and when utilizing all of those
resources right now we have 43 states in the District of Columbia which
have approved them. I hate to see us spending and wasting money powering
more experts to go back and do the same thing. For that reason I cannot
support this Bill. I don’t want to see us continue wasting good
hard-earned and taxpayer dollars to go out and rethink or redo something
that’s already been done collectively, that&#39;s been embraced by 43
states and when they develop them, they looked at internationally what
it would take to compete, to have our students compete. The top
countries around the world when it came to their graduates, we need to
think about what we are doing here. We need to be careful, we need to
deliberative and that provision of this Bill gives me heartburn, the
extent to which I cannot support the Bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President?
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
Speak on the Bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Tillman has the floor, speak to the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator McKissick, maybe you were absent last year when we passed the
bill, eliminating the Common Core. That bill has passed. And during that
we set up a standards commission to have higher and better standards for
North Carolina and not be dictated by national set of standards. Now,
your 43 and your 48 are both wrong on states that are now doing Common
Core. For most liberal state one of the most in the whole US of A was
State of Washington. Democrat controlled legislature has now agreed as
did the Republicans a year ago in that same state and the Democrats have
done the same thing. Said, we don’t want any more of Common Core. Now,
they lay common to the table, but that State will eliminate Common Core.
We fought this battle and you lost. That Bill passed. Now we go set up
our own standards commission of experts and I fully believe North
Carolina can do this better and have higher standards and more
appropriate standards. There is nothing magical about a set of standards
and nobody said they were all perfect. They are not. That&#39;s why we
are paying the Standards Commission to look into this with experts and
to come up with our own North Carolina standards. That&#39;s simply all
we are doing.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
Speak a second time on the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Speaker McKissick, has the floor, speak a second time on the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
The data relating to the 43 States of District Columbia is available
right now on a website dealing with Common Core as of 25 minutes ago.
Now, it may be incorrect but it&#39;s certainly put out there by the
entity or organization that supports Common Core throughout this
country. So as the accuracy of that data, it seems to have come from a
very authoritative source and then I can’t help believe that it is
accurate. Notwithstanding bills and legislation we passed last year,
notwithstanding the lack of wisdom they are doing so, why go out and
spend more money unless we are going to try to lower the standards. Not
when our students be able to compete, I want our students to thrive. I
want them to reach the highest potential. I don’t want to lower the bar.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
Speak a second time.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Tillman, has the floor, speak a second time.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator McKissick this was about partisan bill and this is not a
partisan issue. It&#39;s about who sets our standards. If you want a
conglomerate of states to do that, you are entitled to that belief. We
don’t think that way and the bill that we passed, exactly puts it back
in our hands where it ought to have been all along. That&#39;s all with
that.
[Speaker Changes]
Any further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, question for the
senate, is the passage of Senate Bill 14 on a second reading?

CHANGES] Senator Tillman has the floor for a point of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now many of you are not qualified to speak
on what would make 50 years of wedded bliss because you haven&#39;t been
married that long. Now there are a few of you that have. I&#39;ve been
married, my wife and I, for 51 years. I finally, bless her! [APPLAUSE] I
finally figured out, and I seldom share deep wisdom with you, but I
think this I must share with you. I figured out what it takes to have 50
years of wedded bliss. Now you&#39;ve got to think all along during your
marriage, on the 25th you want to do something real nice for your wife.
Take her to Alaska. On the 50th you go back and get her. [LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Don&#39;t anybody pay attention to Senator
Tillman&#39;s wisdom on marriage. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To make an announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer has the floor for an announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, a moment of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the
floor, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Two years ago I spoke on the floor for
the first time, and I understand that my voice even cracked. Well today
I do so with great confidence and the reason for this is to wish Senator
Curtis a very happy 21st birthday. So happy birthday, Senator Curtis.
Thank you very much for my opportunity to speak two years ago and you
had no idea what that would get started. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [APPLAUSE]
Any further notices or announcements? Is there any further business to
come before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for
a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President this is a motion to
recess. Mr. President, I move that the Senate now stand in recess,
subject to the standard stipulations set forth in Rule 24.1, and
messages from the House, to reconvene at 6:25PM. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
motion is that the Senate do now stand in recess, subject to the
