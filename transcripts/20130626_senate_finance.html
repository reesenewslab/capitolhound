Bingo. How's that? I would want you guy miss a word I have to say Sir
Apodaca Okay in deed. We give thanks to as always our segregated arm
staff if we could have one of them check the air conditioner and make
sure we keep it cool around for senator Hunt and Hise that would be
appreciated so if you could turn it down or not please. Welcome to our
Senate pages. Eva your handwriting and mine isn't too good from Oxford
senator McKissick welcome. Trip ally Davie county senator Brock Seya
Nubby Senator Curtis and it can do the justice I don't care what can
might that be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Blushy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Grand Murphy from Darn senator Woodard Garret Barlow
boom senator Soucek Kina Nolan Charlotte senator Clodfelter Ashley Kings
Neets Fair senator Brown Ashley, Victoria Fernstak, Rocky Mountains
senator Bryant Welcome. If you see we pass anything today that might not
stand Supreme Court master. If you could please let us know you can save
lot of money and lot of time.
Thank you we will now move on and to the enter the agenda. We will do
local bills first bill 107. We have an amendment for that.
Representative ?? Thank you and we have an amendment from Senator
Sanderson Okay. You have the floor and then senator Sanderson you can
explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman this is a very simple bill. I
know we have heard that before. About 20 years ago global trance park
was created and 20 years it was supposed to bring in 53 thousand jobs.
Over the course of last 20 years it hasn't done that. It's brought in
very few. It's been a money pit. Bottom line is there is a find there
that was collected from the license plates and some of you remember that
so GGP license plates for several years they added five dollars on your
fee in getting the plates and this money went into a fund that the
global trance park was going to use to loan out to the counties they
lone it out to them with interest and they use it for infrastructure
academic development within the counties. This money has not bend on out
for the last couple.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me representative we have a motion from Senator
Cook but we have not heard the amendment. Would you like to amend that
bill now senator Sanderson before we go further.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I think all the members have a copy and
the amendment would do only one thing would add Pamlico County to
craven. This is at the request of our board accounting commissioners
that they'd be headed to this local bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay there is unremembered before you Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman Senator Sanderson is only
Pamlico County that you are adding?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman can somebody explain to me this 5 dollar
license fee. Is it everybody in the state or just the folks that live in
those county? Would you like to explain that or would you care for
staff? Do we have a staff or something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's no longer being collected. But out might be
saying of the time it was only those on that region who had got a
certain plate but it has not been collected since 1999.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So we are there evidently as a balance in that
account? Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. This staff may have a balance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Another follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would it not be best if we just said every county that
had paid into that got reimbursed that amount? I am just think out loud.
Well originally it was but somehow got amended to just Craven County.
Senator Brown.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Again I am reading senator ?? amendment in just
says to allow certain counties.I guess somewhere else.</p>

<p id="05:00">
Representative: …that, maybe, specifies that county is just Craven
county, I guess. It was my understanding, Senator Sanderson, that you
were going to amend the bill to include all the counties in the eastern
region – to have that option, I guess.
Representative : Okay, do we have a dialogue going, or…? Senator
Tillman?
Representative: I believed that more than those two counties
participated in this [xx] collection thing. I do not want to muddy the
waters, but I think we are fixing to muddy the waters anyway. Those
counties that don’t get to share in this – that participated in the $5,
when we were collecting it , they are going to be left out according to
what I am reading here. Is that true? I need an answer to that.
Speaker: I will ask the Representative to respond to that, but I think
that is where Senator Apodaka was headed. Do you care to respond sir?
Representative: The original bill, without just Craven County, the
original bill was intended to allow any of the counties that paid into
that to get their money back. The current law states that if they pull
out of the region, they can get their money back only after the region
falls part, i.e. that it is dissolved. What this bill is intended to do
is to allow them to pull out and get their money right away. It must be
used for economic development. They will only get their potion. In the
case of Craven County, it is about a 1.5 million. So it depends on the
county, how much was put into their, on the license plates fees and
everything else. So, it s only taking their portion of the money less
any loans or money outstanding they may have left out.
Speaker: Further questions or debate? Senator Jenkins.
Representative: Mr. Chairman, I would be willing to offer a second
amendment if this is all of the counties that have the same rights and
privileges, not just a few.
Representative: Mr. Chairman, I would agree to that.
Speaker: Do we want to just hold this until our next meeting and move
forward? Senator Apodaka?
Representative: Why don’t we towards the end and [xx], because I don’t
know how many more of these meetings we are going to have.
Representative: Do you have about ten minutes for, about fifteen minutes
at our disposal, please? We will straighten this out in between now and
then.
Speaker: It is a Edgecombe County occupancy tax. I believe that is going
to be Senator Jenkins. Senator Jenkins, did you move that so you could
get up and leave or did you [xx]?
Representative: I am enjoying my time here…
Speaker: Well, I enjoy your outfit. You have the floor.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This bill is Edgecombe County
occupancy tax. I discussed with Senator Tucker at lunch. He is very
excited about this bill. It is what a lot of other counties have done,
is to levy the occupancy tax on travel…
Representative: Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Senator Harrington, I would
like to move for a favorable report on this bill.
Speaker: To move for a favorable report, by Senator Apodaka. Hearing no
further discussion or debate, all those in favor say aye [aye]. Opposed,
no [silence]. Motion carries. Prepare yourself for the next. So, house
816, Representative Laneman, come on forward.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. House bill 816 is the tobacco
grower assessment act and all this does is set up an opportunity for the
tobacco growers association collect their dues and use it for that. It
is with the [xx] act.
Speaker: Thank you sir. Senator Jackson, you are recognized.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I move for a favorable report.
Speaker: Thank you sir. Motion for a favorable report from Senator
Jackson. Any discussion or debate? Senator McKissick?
Representative: Just a quick question. I take it that what we are voting
on right now is the bill that came out of act yesterday – it does not
have any amendments attached or anything like that?
Speaker: That is correct.
Representative: Okay, just want to make sure. Thank you.
Speaker: Further discussion</p>

Hearing none, all those in favor of the motion, please say Aye. Opposed,
no. Ayes have it, motion carries and Senator Jackson will be running
down on the floor. Thank you, Sir. Let’s see, Representative Glazier,
House Bill 462, increase family court fee. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very briefly, this bill which passed the house 107 to
4 and sponsored by the Cumberland Delegation deals with the facility
that’s in Cumberland which is a supervised visitation and exchange
center to be used by victims of domestic violence and the parties and it
allows the exchange of ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I think this is an excellent bill, move
for favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree with you, whole heartedly though we have a
motion before us for favorable report. Discussion or debate? All those
in favor, please say Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries. Thank you,
Senator. Representative Glazier, you may head on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, Hunter education and ?? permit, this
is a PCS. Motion here to PCS from Senator Brock, all in favor please say
Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I bring this bill before you;
I was called in late working with this bill with Representative Bell.
This is his bill and he is in session, so I’m doing this for him. This
bill really allows for some fee increases on certain hunting and fishing
licenses. Repeals the County hunting and fishing trapping licenses etc.
This bill, through the increase in fees or raise for the wildlife
resources commission about $2.5 million. We in the Senate budget reduced
their budget significantly. I think the number was $9 million roughly
and they can’t survive on that. Obviously it’s a substantial cut but
they were gonna try to work through that and then I think the house
restored about 4-5 million dollars of that money and then through these
fee adjustments. Wildlife resources commission is moving towards being
self-sufficient, not depended upon state dollars. So this increase in
fees and some of them have not been increased in a long time but things
that may come up and you may hear about this in this bill is that we’re
going from the adjusted age for special licenses from 65 to 70. I’d hope
to get my permanent license in two years, now I’m gonna have to wait 7.
Hopefully, by the time I’m able to get my licenses, I’ll be able to buy
a coat like Senator Jenkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m waiting for Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. I think the explanation is adequate; if
someone has questions later, I’ll be glad to answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think everybody has this; I may get the staff to
help me with this but there was a concern about deleting some dollars
that I had a concern with and I’ll staff touch on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Heather, could you help us please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Senator Brown’s amendment clarifies how the
compensation to the vessel agency collect fees on the behalf of the
commissioner paid. Under current law, they come out of the fee. This
language would allow the surcharge to be imposed in addition to the fee.
Sir that is the clarifying language that Senator Brown offers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any questions? Senator Brown, you have a
motion to accept; Okay, we have a motion from Senator Brown on the
amendment. Those in favor, please say Aye. Opposed, no. Ayes have it,
motion of amendment carries. We have a motion from Senator Brock to
accept PCS as amended, unfavorable to the original. Those in favor,
please say Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it, motion carries. Thank
you. Okay, eliminate tax designation for political party, House 951.
Welcome, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is
a simple bill. House Bill 951.</p>

...WOULD ELIMINATE THAT 3 DOLLAR CHECK-OFF POLITICAL PARTIES THAT YOU
SEE ON THE FAMILIAR D400 INDIVIDUAL TAX FORM. BY DOING SO, YOU PREVENT
THE DIVERSION OF WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND FROM
GOING TO POLITICAL PARTIES, ONE OF THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, DEMOCRAT,
REPUBLICAN, OR LIBERTARIAN, AND WE PUT IT BACK IN THE GENERAL FUND WHERE
IT BELONGS. IT'S A 2 MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FOR THE GENERAL FUND BY DOING
THIS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU, SIR. YOU EXPLAINED THAT VERY WELL. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE, WE
HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR TILLMAN TO ACCEPT THIS BILL. ALL THOSE IN --
YES SIR, SENATOR MCKISSICK?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'D JUST LIKE TO GET SOME INDICATION..WHAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS ARE THAT
HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN RECENT YEARS AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN DISTRIBUTED.
WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL, I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT OUR
POLITICAL PARTIES GETTING ADEQUATE CONTRIBUTIONS, ASSISTANCE, AND THE
EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN DO IT WITHOUT GETTING IN DONATIONS, SOMETIMES
FROM PUBLIC OR FROM INTEREST GROUPS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PHILOSOPHY OR
PERSPECTIVE. I THINK THAT'S PERHAPS A GOOD THING, HOW I SIMPLY TRY TO
GET MORE DETAIL, IF WE COULD, ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING TO
OUR PARTIES AND OUR STATE.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
YES SIR, YOU MAY ANSWER.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
SENATOR MCKISSICK, I THINK FOR THE QUESTION -- FOLKS THIS IS A QUESTION
I'VE PARTICULARLY AVOIDED. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH GOES TO
PARTICULAR PARTIES ON THIS ISSUE, SO I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO STAFF. I
THINK IT'S RELATIVELY IRRELEVANT. THE ISSUE IS, SHOULD THE STATE,
PARTICULARLY THE TAX COLLECTING ARM OF THE STATE, BE ?? DONATIONS FOR
POLITICAL PARTIES.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
FURTHER DISCUSSION.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
IF THE STAFF COULD HELP WITH THAT, I WOULD APPRECIATE JUST GETTING THAT
INFORMATION IN THE RECORD.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
SENATOR MCKISSICK, THE AMOUNT THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED IN RECENT YEARS
FROM THE CHECK-OFF HAS BEEN IN THE 2 MILLION DOLLAR RANGE AND THAT
AMOUNT FUNDS THE POLITICAL PARTIES' FINANCING FUND AND THE NORTH
CAROLINA PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR FUND.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU, I GUESS MY THOUGHTS ARE THAT ..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
IS THIS A FOLLOW-UP OR COMMENT?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
SIMPLY A COMMENT. AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE VOTED UPON,
BUT MY THOUGHTS ARE SIMPLY THIS. IT'S GREAT WHEN WE CAN HAVE PUBLIC
FINANCING TO AN EXTENT THAT'S FEASIBLE TO DO SO. THE EXTENT TO WHICH
SPECIAL INTEREST OR CONTRIBUTING MONIES, FOR WHICHEVER POLITICAL PARTY
IT IS, WHETHER ITS REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS OR SOME OTHER PARTY THAT
MIGHT BE OUT THERE, SOME THIRD PARTY, AND I THINK THAT IT SERVES A
PUBLIC INTEREST, A PUBLIC GOOD, FOR US TO TRY TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY,
BECAUSE I DO GET DEEPLY CONCERNED WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY BEING SPENT
BY DEDICATED INTEREST GROUPS TO PROMOTE A CERTAIN PHILOSOPHY. AND I'LL
LEAVE IT AT THAT.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU, SIR. SENATOR TILLMAN, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE AN ANXIOUS LOOK
ON YOUR FACE.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I GOT MEAN WORDS, BUT I'M GOING TO HOLD THEM UNTIL I SEE AN APPROPRIATE
TIME TO.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU, SIR. IS THERE A MOTION TO ACCEPT? THERE'S SEVERAL MOTIONS TO
ACCEPT. ONE FROM SENATOR RABIN. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR FOR HOUSE
BILL 951. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION PLEASE SAY &quot;AYE&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
AYE.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OPPOSED, &quot;NO&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
NO.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
MOTION CARRIED. THANK YOU, SIR.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK THE COMMITTEE, THANK THE CHAIRMAN.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATE BILL 261. SALES TAX REFUND FOR REGIONAL
JAILS. SENATOR JENKINS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. ONCE AGAIN, QUICKLY, MARTIN COUNTY AND BERTIE
COUNTY WENT TOGETHER AND BUILT A JOINT JAIL, WHICH WE OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE
TO SAVE THEM MONEY, HOWEVER THEY WILL NOT GET THEIR SALES TAX REFUND
BECAUSE A JOINT JAIL IS NOT LISTED AS ONE OF THE REGIONAL THINGS THAT
CAN GET THE REFUND. AND ALL THIS BILL DOES IS SAY THAT THE DISTRICT
CONTAINMENT FACILITY IS ADDED TO THE LIST OF ENTITIES THAT CAN GET THIS
SALES TAX REFUND.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
THANK YOU, I HAVE A QUESTION TO ADD. JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, AS IT WAS
EXPLAINED TO ME BY THE BILL SPONSOR, SINCE THIS IS TWO COUNTIES RATHER
THAN ONE, THAT'S WHERE THE MONKEY WRENCH IS, VERY GOOD, THANK YOU SIR,
WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR TILLMAN, AS ALWAYS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
MR. CHAIRMAN.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OH YES INDEED, SIR ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
SENATOR JENKINS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THIS FORMER BILL ABOUT SPENDING
TIME SOMEWHERE AND I JUST WONDERED IF THAT WAS TIED INTO THIS ALSO.

Representative: … our area. I am glad we got that clarified. So we have
a question from Senator Heist?
Representative: I have a question which may be in the broader. When we
are looking at sales tax refunds, and we have had several conversations
on not returning sales tax returns to particular government entities as
a whole, does the timing of when this will pass, does this mean that
ultimately you could wind up where county jails are the only entity that
would get the sales tax refund after reform bill, before reform bill. I
guess my inquiry is – isn’t this part of the overall tax reform
discussion?
Speaker: Ask Cindy.
Representative: Yes. The way it is written, it would be added to the
list of those nongovernmental entities that are refund. This would begin
with purchases made after July 1, 2013. The bill that you have passed,
you would eliminate those refunds beginning with fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2014. If you make that policy decision, then this county will
receive those refunds for a year.
Speaker: Thank you. We had a motion, I believe from Senator Tillman, for
a favorable report? All those in favor please say aye [aye], no
[silence]. Thank you, motion carries. Senator Apodaka, senate bill 480,
would you like to do that first? I think it is right, thank you Senator
Apodaka, we will go back to house bill 107.
Representative: Mr. Chairman, I would like to send forth an amendment.
Speaker: Senator Apodaka has amended the bill, would you like to explain
that amendment sir?
Representative: Yes sir. I just took the language that was in for those
counties that actually paid the fee, they will be eligible to get their
monies back. I noticed Jones County was in there, and I do not think I
could go on without protecting Jones County.
Speaker: Thank you sir, so we have a motion for amendment 2? All those
in favor of the amendment say aye [aye], opposed, no [silence].
Amendment carries and we are back on #1 which is before us. All those in
favor of the amendment will say….i am not correct here? I am getting
looks?
Representative: Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the amendment #1.
Speaker: Thank you, that amendment #1 is withdrawn and we are back to
the original bill. Thank you. So, all those in favor of the bill as
amended please say aye…Senator Heist? You are full of questions today
senator Heist, we go to use some cool in here.
Representative: I know. I am trying to get a census as a whole and what
I remember of the global transport. The global transport took a large
loan from the state and [xx] fund, when we put that in. over the last
two years, we have done a nice shell game, and moved around, and for
practical reasons said, we took money out of the [xx] fund and it was
just a gift to global transport, that is the way I would summarize that.
I would hope to say that I was unaware that there were a pot of funds
that was paid into that global transport was to use as revenue before we
got into this. So now we are saying that we have paid you off, you may
or may not be profitable but let’s take away the funds and give it back
to the counties you would ultimately have made money off of? I mean
there have been jobs created, but not nearly the amount they promised ,
I grant that.
Speaker: Representative Caley?
Representative: The money has not been loaned from that fund for several
years and John Schafey, when he spoke to the house finance committee,
said they were holding onto that money in case they had to use it for
operating funds. This money belongs to the county, and I think that was
one of the deciding factors to get the committee to pass this. The money
belongs to the counties and under current law, they get that money back
if it falls apart. It is not operating funds and it is not</p>

…they’re responsible for this debt. We just okay it. Could we do it that
way and not have to go one by one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I will defer to bill sponsor on that and see how he
wants to handle this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be fine with me. I understand the bladder
control issues Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. I was suffering this list for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Jenkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When I was going I couldn’t ?? this revenue was
gridlock when I got it out of ??. Anyway I move for favor of the forward
block ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to send forward an amendment please. Members
have copies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Brunstetter amends the bill.
Senator Brunstetter will…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman, this amendment does two things. First of all
it removes one of the projects at the request of the university system.
I believe it’s a pedestrian walkway but it’s a fairly minor project and
that’s being removed from the list. The second is as it relates to the
transfer of the Bowman Gray Stadium from the City of Winston-Salem to
Winston-Salem State, it adds a variety of conditions onto the transfer
to insure that the NASCAR racing operations continues largely intact as
it currently stands.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. We have an amendment by Senator
Brunstetter. A discussion on the amendment? Senator Tucker is your
discussion on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s on the bill. Any further discussion on the
amendment? Senator McKissick
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter. I know there was some controversy
about this project last year and I’m glad to see it’s resolved and it
looks like the acquisition is here. Have all the parties agreed upon the
contents of your amendment? Is everybody onboard with what’s suggested?
I know that looking at further detail there’s also a language there
dealing with the ability to sell alcohol at events related to the NASCAR
facility but I guess that remains all intact. Is it dealing with the
conditions in which things would occur?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Senator
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick. I would never represent that all
parties are on board. The University system is onboard, Winston-Salem
State’s onboard, NASCAR operations have been consulted as part of this.
There’s going to be some people in our community who are going to be
uncomfortable with change and that will continue but this is an effort
to try to make sure that those concerns are addressed in some reasonable
way at this level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and I might say..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick
[SPEAKER CHANGES] …this bill overall, I do appreciate the kind of
institutional equity that’s shown here this year.  It does not go in
others.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Is there any further discussion on the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who said that? That was Senator Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a question on the stadium. Have we looked at any
type of environmental impact of buying this property and taking it under
our control than from the city about what was under the parking lot
years ago and around the lot?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Brown’s up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I don’t know the answer but I do know
that any acquisition like this will be done with the full processes that
the university system uses in general and they’re here, they can comment
on that but it goes through the same kind of scrutiny that any other
project would go through.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Further discussion? If not all those who
are in favor of the amendment please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. Amendment carried. We’re back to the
original bill and Senator Tucker has a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I don’t have a question. I just want to
make a comment. Senator Tillman mentioned self liquidating debt here and
that the students pay for it. Often times the legislature gets blamed
for the increases in tuition. I just want to make sure this is a request
of the university system for these buildings and, I heard a number, $450
increase per student is not coming from the legislature. It’s based on a
request that the university system and we, in the legislature, did not
increase that tuition. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re absolutely right Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I would like to send forth the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t think the members have a problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Send forward the amendment and have the floor to
discuss the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman. When we were putting this
together we had somewhat of a difficult time with getting some factual
information from the universities on some of these projects. I think we
asked for a little more detail than has been asked for in the past, so
with that taken into consideration, we prepared this…</p>

...amendment to make sure they report to Gov Ops before they proceed
with these projects to make sure everything's in order. I think this
gives us some good assurances as a body that things are being done
properly. We have no reason to believe they're not, Drew, I don't want
to upset you. But I think this is just a good precaution for us. Senator
Tucker ought to like this. So I recommend its adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any discussion on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just speak to the amendment and maybe a question for
staff. I think this is a great amendment. Something we need. I know
before Gov Ops we asked Tom Ross about the current needs of the system
and they've said they have about $2 billion outstanding in repair and
renovations for existing buildings. And I know there's some new
buildings in their request. How much of this goes towards that $2
billion worth of needs that we need at our existing buildings? Do we
have that with staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't believe these go towards that, no. Not towards
those projects.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Noted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Bondo, can you respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, Mark Bondo with this research. The $2 billion
figure that was being referenced is the general funds supported building
at UNC, so these are receipt supported buildings and so therefore would
not impact that need at the university system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any follow up then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to make a recommendation. I think if they have $2
billion worth of needs, I think they should help pay for some of those
buildings. It would be nice if instead of building a new building every
time, they need to clean the gutters and repair the roofs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Hartsell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just wanted to ask the bill's sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the Rizzo Center addition at Chapel Hill on the
Horace Williams campus?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I certainly hope not, Senator. We hope to deal with
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. We have one more question from Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is for the bill's sponsor or anybody on staff.
When these self-liquidating bonds are paid off, do the students receive
a reduction in tuition once these are paid off?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can answer that for you, Senator. I doubt it,
seriously. I haven't seen it in any bills I've paid for dumb and dumber,
my two kids.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very good. Hearing no further discussion, we will now
vote on the amendment. All those in favor please say aye. Opposed no.
Amendment carries back to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Favorable report has been requested by Senator Tillman
for Senate Bill 480 as amended. All those in favor please say aye.
Opposed no. Motion carried. Thank you, Senator Apodaca. If you would
like to continue with Senate Bill 485, and I believe that is a PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. It is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion is PCS from Senator Hise. All those in favor
please say aye. Opposed? The motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, this does two
things. Number one it allows the Board of Governors to get rid of a,
originally it was ?? reporting but we've gutted that out and put in the
use of electronic commerce infrastructure and capabilities so they can
buy through a system and take advantage of discounts that are available
for larger orders and work between each other. The second thing is this
is in for NC State dealing with some issues they're having with some of
their sorority and fraternity houses and getting those fixed up and
getting them up to snuff and dealing with the taxing of said Greek
homes. Basically this is it and I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good thing. I think it
will streamline and make their reporting easier and update it to meet
the new computerized equipment. And it's something they've been needing
and it's a good bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you. Any more discussion or debate?
All right. Hearing none, Senator Tillman moves for a report favorable to
the PCS, unfavorable to the original. All those in favor please say aye,
opposed no. Motion carried. Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the business before the committee
today. The meeting is adjourned.</p>
