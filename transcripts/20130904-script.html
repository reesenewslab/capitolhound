  <p id="00:00">Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms, close the doors. Members go
to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery will please silence
all electronic devices. Leading the senate in prayer is the reverend
Peter Milner Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will
please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's bow our heads for a second and pray. Lord, thank you for this
new day. Thank you for mercy, it falls fresh on us with every turning of
every day. Give every Senator here a glimpse of your mercy. If you move
us forward into this day keep their eyes on you, this we ask in the name
of Christ, Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. The journal of Tuesday, September 3, 2013
has been examined and is found to be correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate, let's come. Senators, senators let's come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move we dispense with the reading of the journal and that it stand
approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection the journal for September 3, 2013 stands approved
as written. We have leaves of absence granted today for Senators
Clodfelter, Daniel, Don Davis, Senator Beringer and Senator Woodard.
Veto messages from the Governor, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Governor's of rejection and veto message, house bill 392, an act
requiring a county department of social services, DSS, to verify whether
an applicant for our recipient of temporary assistance for needy
families, TANF, benefits of food and nutrition services, FNS benefits,
is a fleeing felon or probation or parole violator to direct
inter-agency cooperation and information sharing in order to verify the
eligibility status of an applicant or recipient to deny TANF or FNS
benefits to an applicant or a recipient who was a fleeing felon or on
probation or parole violator and to require drug screening and testing
for certain applicants and recipients for Work First program assistance.
It is critical that funding for public benefits be protected from abuses
by felons and those fleeing prosecution. The criminal background
requirements makes sense on house bill 392. Therefore, under my existing
executive authority, I am directing the department of Human Health and
Human Services and our state chief information officer to develop a plan
and recommendation to ensure that fugitive felons and probation or
parole violators do not receive these public benefits and that the law
enforcement has access to the most up-to-date information. This
administration believes that there are better ways to fight addiction
and prevent criminal drug abuse. However, this is not the best way
forward and I must veto this bill because of my concerns about the
implementation of the drug testing provisions which were not thoroughly
analyzed prior to passing this legislation. Additional veto reasons
include: The changes that been required are not funded in this bill or
the 2013/15 budget. The bill is a step backwards for DHS and it's
efforts to assist people in combating substance abuse. The department
currently screens all adult applicants for substance abuse issues and as
appropriate, facilitates a treatment plan with which the applicant must
comply prior to receiving benefits. I am concerned that the means for
establishing reasonable suspicion as outlined in the bill are not
sufficient to mandate a drug test under the fourth amendment. The
punitive mandates of this bill go too far in restricting future access
to benefits that could have a negative impact on children and families.
Similar efforts in other states have proven costly for taxpayers and did
little to help fight drug addiction. There are potential obstacles to
consistent applications across 100 counties. I continue to recommend
further study on this issue. Pat McCrory, governor of the state of North
Carolina. Governor's rejection veto measures House bill 786. An act to
require the department of public safety to study-

  <p id="05:00">Pat McCrory: -discussing the problem of illegal immigration in this
state, and to clarify which employers are subject to the state’s
E-Verify Laws. I am vetoing House Bill 786 because I promise to protect
and find out for North Carolinians.
This bill has been thinly disguised as a measure to help our farming
community, when in fact it applies to a broad spectrum of other
businesses in both urban and rural areas. There is a loophole that would
allow businesses to exempt a higher percentage of employees from
[??]pulling their illegal U.S. citizens or residents. This legislation
increases the seasonal employee  90-day exemption to nearly 9 months in
a calendar year, and will put our legal residents at a disadvantage in
the job market.
We must do everything we can to help protect jobs for North
Carolinians first and foremost. This legislation needs further study, as
I recommended months ago. However, the bill did not provide funding for
a study. North Carolina has the fifth highest unemployment in the
country. Now is not the time to put our citizens at a disadvantage to
find jobs. I have remained focused on jobs growth in North Carolina and
I will continue to do so in the future. Therefore, I veto the bill. Pat
McCrory, Governor of State North Carolina.

Apodaca: Senator Apodaca  for a purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker  1: Mr. President,  motion please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apodaca: Senator Apadaca is for [??]a promotion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker  1 : Mr. President, the two veto messages  just read in by
the clerk, I move that they be placed on the beginning of today’s
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apadacas: Objection [Sp]Soren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker  1: Mr. President, additional motion while I’m up please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apadacas: Of course Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker 1: Thank you Mr. President. I move the rules be suspended
until the end, it’s house joint resolution  1024. Adjourn, reconvene

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Corcory: House Bill 392. Warrant Status /Drug Screen. Public
Assistance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apadacas: Senator Apadacas, recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Corcory: Mr. President, I move that House Bill 392 become law,
notwithstanding the objections of the Governor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apadacas: Is there any discussion or debate? [Pause] Senator Nesbit

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Corcory: Would the gentleman yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apadacas: Senator Apadacas to yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Corcory: Certainly.  I’m not able keep up with you this morning.
Which one of these bills is this?  394 or 5? The Drug Screen/Public
Assistance.  [Pause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apadacas: Any discuss or debate. [Pause] Hearing none, the motion
before the body is that House Bill 392 become law, notwithstanding the
objections of the Governor. Senator Davis, what purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Davis:  To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apadacas: Senator Davis, you have the floor to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Davis: Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, with all due
respect to the Governor, this bill was never and is not designed to be
an effective way to fight criminal drug abuse. This was a bill that was
designed to quit supporting those people who use illegal drugs and their
habit and to try to move them into self-sufficiency so that they can
have a job.
We don’t want to hard working North Carolinians to be supporting
illegal drug use. I believe that illegal drug use is a scourge, a plague
on our society. This is just the one way that we can help to steer
people away from that. I’d like just to briefly summarize what this bill
does.
What part one does is, we know that Federal law prohibits fleeing
felons or individuals with active arrest warrants, probation, or parole
violations from receiving certain benefits. This bill gives DHHS the
authority to take the steps necessary for compliance. Specifically the
warrant status provisions of House Bill 392 would require a County
Department of Social Services to verify whether an applicant for or a
recipient of TANF funds or Food and Nutrition Service benefits is a
fleeing felon, or a probation or parole violator.
The act would further deny TANF or FNS benefits to an applicant or
recipient subject to an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony, or for
a probation, or parole violation, but would not affect the eligibility
of a member of the individual’s household for those benefits.
Part two applies to the Work First Program. That is the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families. H392 -
Notes: I was able to verify the names of Apadacas and McCrory online,
and but in [sp] for the other names I could not find verification for. I
had 2 [??], but put my best estimate after listening to the audio slowed
down and at normal speed.

  <p id="10:00">Requires that some individuals who apply for or receive work force
program assistance, North Carolina's temporary assistance for needy
families program, take and pass a drug test prior to receiving benefits.
This drug testing requirements applies only to applicants or recipients
whom DHHS suspects are engaged in the illegal use of controlled
substances. The bill does not apply to child only cases in which no
adult is included in a benefit calculation. I ask for the members to
override this veto and to approve this bill. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson has the floor to speak to the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, members this bill has not
changed since we've seen it just a few weeks ago. I would ask that you
support this bill. It is the right thing to do for our ag community. We
need the 9 monthly verified exemption in there, which will help us
mirror their federal H to A program, which is actually the only true and
legal way to have a work force for agriculture in North Caroline and the
United States currently. This bill in no way adds to the illegals and if
you're hiring illegals, it's still illegal to do so and you're wrong.
This will help us reduce the paperwork that we as H to A growers have to
do from year to year to year. I would ask for your support and
appreciate it. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor, senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you. The Democrats will caucus immediately
after session and then the second thing would be a point of personal
preference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor, senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Members, I'm not gonna keep you
long today but we don't but gather up every so often and when there are
matters that I feel are -- that we feel are -- pressing to the body.
This is our opportunity to bring them before you. We find ourselves in a
situation right now where the -- as you've all seen in the paper, the
unemployment rate in this state is now the third highest in this
country. The economy is not clicking along in this state -- I don't know
what it's doing in the rest of the country, but it's not in here. We
should do everything we can to help that economy. There have been some
things that we've done and we pointed those out as we went that took
money out of this economy
But something that's occurred here lately is not something of your
doing but if you don't do something about it before long, you're going
to own it too. While the unemployment rate's third highest in the
country, apparently 1.7 million dollars was given and raised to DHHS.
Now last I heard from you all, they were the problem, not the solution.
I don't know if those increases were appropriate or not, but if they
were, apparently they didn't give them to the right people. Because
we've got two things called NC Tracks and NC FAST over there that aren't
on track and aren't fast and they're about to kill this state. I've
started gathering information and I found out on NC Tracks for instance,
their goal that they've set for the approval of claims is like 59% for
institutional claims, 68% for professional claims -- that'd be your
doctors -- and I'm looking at that and I'm saying 59 and 68? Why is that
the goal? Well, that's the goal, because they set it 10 percent less
than they used to do under their old legacy system because of
anticipated problems.
So now we've already gone down ten percent. On professional claims,
the ... of one million 500 claims they approved 553,000 or 36%. So the
doctors of this state that are providing Medicaid and sending their
bills in -- 2/3 of them are being turned down under their system. ou're
getting the same emails I am, I hope, but I'm getting emails from people
who say they're going out of business if they don't get this
straightened out. They're underpaid from Medicaid as it starts with and
they cannot just sit there and do without. One of the fellows was
actually thrown out of the system and it totally wasn't nec--

  <p id="20:00">Eligable and he can't get eligible again to even get his claims
submitted. We must do something about this. The state of North Carolina,
I believe, it used to be and I think it probably still is, is the
largest consumer in the state. We consume from the public, and therefore
pay them for more stuff than anybody. And if we aren't paying our bills
then how in the world is this economy going to operate if the biggest
contractor in the state isn't paying his bills. We've asked for hearings
and I would urge you to do that. Something must be done and somebody's
got to get a handle on this and when I get an analysis like this, and by
the way, the problem is, I believe the word was taxonomy. Taxonomy, the
problem is taxonomy. Now only in the world of DHHS could you find
another acronym to describe the new problem. You go look it up, I had to
look it up to see what it meant. But that's the problem is taxonomy. So
we need to gather up down here and get a hold of this thing and get
somebody moving over there. And I thought I would bring it to your
attention.
[speaker changes] Is there any further notices or announcements?
[speaker changes] Mr. President.
[speaker changes] Senator [??]
[speaker changes] Point of personal privilege.
[speaker changes] Senator [??]. You have the floor [??] point of
personal privilege.
[speaker changes] Since we were here in last July and last convened
doing our work one member has [??] resignation Senator [??] we may not
all agree with her philosophically on her position on issues, but I
think we all know that she was a passionate, vocal advocate for those
causes that she believed in ans she served this body with integrity for
about 17-18 years so I would ask that we adjourn today in her honor. Due
to her years of service and I'm sure that we will all miss her and her
advocacy for those things that she believed in particularly those things
that were progressive in terms of leadership in this state and someone
who was certainly a dear friend to me. Thank you.
[speaker changes] Senator Tillman [??]
[speaker changes] Personal privilege
[speaker changes]Senator Tillman has the floor for a moment of
personal privilege.
[speaker changes] I know if Don East were here he would have a word
to say out of admeration and respect for Ellie [??], and I do to. She
now has the old office that I had and she was happy to be there. In
fact, I liked that office. She and I were good, close buddies [??]
offices right next to one another there. You had to like Ellie, her
biggest thorn was never republicans. It was David Hull. She told me that
many times and you all that have been here a while remember one day when
she was questioning David's bill and said 'I think, I think, I think'
and David stood up back there in that seat and said under [??] 'I don't
give a damn what you think.' Now that, she got gavaled down for that, so
if I do to I'll understand, but Ellie was an unabashed Liberal who, it
didn't bother her if David called her every name in the book. She would
be right back up the next instant. You got to love that in a  person, I
mean I don't care what stripe you are, be whatever you are, but be that.
And Ellie never wavered. So I respect her and wish her well. Ya'll
remember when she was double bunked with Howard Lee? She had a 1 in 10
chance of winning. She won. That's the campaign's hardest working lady.
She used to represent part of Randolph county and come to every
Republican event that we would invite her to and once in a while she'd
come to one where she was not invited. That's the lady that I know and
will remember and respect, so I think it's proper that we do adjourn in
honor and respect of the great lady, Ellie [??]
[speaker changes] Any further business to come before the Senate?
[??] the chair recognizes Senator Burger for motion.
[speaker changes] Thank you Mr. President. I actually have an
announcement moment of personal privilege and then the motion of
[speaker changes] You have the floor Senator.
[speaker changes] Thank you. Firs the announcement Appears that this
is the time for us to say goodbye to certain people and one of the
members of our staff is leaving us. Tracey Kimbral has been counseled to

good job

And I guess this is a combination of personal privilege and
announcement. With reference to [??], your comments, I will tell you
that many of us agree with you and we agree that those problems are not
of our making. In fact, those problems go back to the last
administration with the attempted implementation of a computer program
which I think everybody would have to acknowledge still has bugs in it.
We will be, today hopefully, announcing the interim committees, and the
Republicans pledge to work with the Democrats to help solve some of the
problems that you’ve identified and try to make sure that our folks –
your folks, our folks, everybody’s folks – get paid for the work that
they do if they’re entitled to be paid. And unfortunately the system is
not working as… I don’t think anyone thinks it’s working as it should or
as we hope that it will, but we will be appointing the interim
committees, and those committees are the appropriate place for the
legislature to begin to look into those issues. And so I pledge to you,
[??], and to the members of this body that we will work together with
you to try and find the solutions to those problems. And  with that, Mr.
President, I move that having concluded the business for which the
Senate reconvened, I move that the Senate, in honor of Senator Ellie
Kinnaird, do now adjourn in accordance with House Joint Resolution 10
