  <p id="00:00">
  To the first finance committee meeting of the long session, I am joined
by Senator Rabon and Senator Tillman, our cochairs of the Senate finance
and we are excited about a lot of good things that&#39;ll happen this
year. We got a, a very important time as far as getting our budget. The
House is going to be going ahead and taking care of the budget this
time, and then we&#39;ll fix it when it comes back. But first thing
first, I&#39;d like to recognize our Page, Brianna Yo. I think, am I
pronouncing? Thank you. Welcome, appreciate you, hope you enjoy your,
your stay here. And then we have our two members of the sergeant in
arms, Steve McCade and Charles Meselles, both of which are very helpful
with keeping this meeting in order and making sure it runs and actually
allowing the microphone to work for me too. The, let&#39;s spend a
minute since this is our first finance committee meeting and talk, have,
some of our staff, Rodney, will everyone just identify themselves so
that we can have the members recognize who we&#39;re working with this
year?

one of, on this bill, although she won&#39;t be a regular for finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. And then let&#39;s also, since we have a number of members that
are either new to the general assembly or new to finance, would Senator

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

would you identify yourself here and, and. Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot, district 18. Wake County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot, welcome. Okay. Thank you everybody. We have two
important issues today. Both of them are very time sensitive. If you
haven&#39;t heard, the IRC update, there are a number of accountants and
tax filers that want to get this information so that they can file their
tax forms, and that is the first item. That&#39;s the one on there. And
then I believe we&#39;re gonna have a PCS. Senator Rabon, would you give
us a motion please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So moved

  <p id="05:00">
  We accept the PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Senator Rabin is going to
have a PCS which is in your folder which includes an issue of gas tax,
so we have two important issues to take on today. Staff, any comments at
this point. Okay, Senator Rabin, would you take on the first part of
this bill? And he&#39;s going to explain the gas tax. Members of the
committee and members in the audience, this is Senate Bill 20, IRC
update, PCS, now including the gas tax provision. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members. I will go through this quickly and
then I will answer any questions if. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If that&#39;s okay with you, Mr. Chairman. What we are doing in
this bill is we&#39;re going to cut, freeze and stabilize the gas tax.
That is our plan. This is mainly a bill that is just corrects things and
this is why it is coming out when it is now and I will run through it
for you very quickly. We immediately would like to, this bill will put a
floor on the gas tax. It is a tax cut of 2.5 cents. The motor fuels tax
was set at 37.5 cents January 1. This bill immediately lowers that tax
to 35 cents. It also adjusts the formula by which we do this and it does
that by setting the fixed rate at 17.5 cents, which it is now. It then
either sets the, adjust the rate to an additional 17.5 cents, which
brings us to 35, or it uses a factor of 9.9% of the average wholesale
price of gasoline to set the tax. Okay, the other thing this bill does
is it changes the date. We currently set the gas tax twice a year. This
bill will set the gas tax as an annual reset on January 1 rather than
resetting it twice a year, so we will go from March 1 to January 1 at 35
cents, then there will be an automatic reset which will probably be at
35 cents. That is the long and the short. There are adjustments that
will have to be made to the budget because this tax cut will mean $33
million coming out of the current transportation budget, a little over
$8 million will be from the Highway Trust Fund, the balance will be from
the Highway Fund. The bill goes through where those cuts are to be made.
You may have some questions about that and I will answer. I give you the
broad stroke, bridges, contract resurfacing and system preservation have
0 cuts and no, my mistake, ferries have 0 cuts. Primary roads, secondary
roads and cistern preservation have a 1% cut. The remainder of the cuts
come from the Department and from the Highway fund, so that is the long
and the short. Again, we&#39;re planning to cut and freeze, stabilize,
get the volatility out of the motor fuels tax so that going forward the
Department, the industry and the legislature can better forecast and
budget the Department of Transportation. If I have left anything out or
if there are questions, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, members of
the committee? I&#39;ve got Senator Blue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. Senator Rabin I, in listening to the three verbs that you
use, cut, freeze and stabilize, given that the increased demand in fact
seem to be overwhelming demand on the Highway Fund as well as the Trust
Fund, why can&#39;t we just freeze and stabilize with this tax rather
than cutting it? We could freeze it at its current level, leave this $33
million in transportation and therefore not have to back up on making
bridges safe.

  <p id="10:00">
  And these administrative cuts to the department as well as the secondary
primary road cuts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, that&#39;s a tough question
to answer, Senator Blue, and it is well put. I would say that if we did
that we might have difficulty in some or one of the chambers of passing
such a bill and it is imperative that what we do get a floor and the
stabilization to this highly volatile situation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay,
I&#39;ve got Senator McKissick. You moved on me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah,
I know, new seat. Alphabetical order. In any case, I like the part of
the bill dealing with the stability. We certainly have a very volatile
situation. We don&#39;t have a predictable income stream so I appreciate
the need to establish that at $0.175. Now the 9.9%. I mean, I know that,
you know, it&#39;s impossible to look in the future and come up with
sometimes realistic financial projections but I assume that someone has
set there and computed out what that might mean if prices go back up to
where they&#39;ve been historically, you know, over the last three
years, sort of a blended average. Do you know what that impact might be
if we went back in that direction? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In what you&#39;re,
I am assuming that that 9.9, this is off the top of my head but I do
have something that is close to that and we can ask fiscal if we need to
go further. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure and physical might be the group that
has the best answer, but if you can help that would be excellent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Miss Cameron has those and I will believe that if
we will allow Miss Cameron to answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, and
who is that again, Senator Rabin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Cameron.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Cameron. Miss Cameron can you help enlighten us
on the question from Senator McKissick? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick. Again, I&#39;m Amni Cameron with the transportation team on
fiscal research. Are you asking about the tax rates? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it looks as if it&#39;s a guarantee of $0.175 or 9.9%, so that
increase goes up to 9.9 I guess if that were to kick in. You know,
whichever is greater. I was just wondering based upon projections. I
assume some financial projections have been made based upon this new
standard that would tell us what we might anticipate if the price of
fuel goes back up to what it&#39;s been before we saw these rapid
decreases because I don&#39;t think we can anticipate them staying there
indefinitely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m gonna give you a series of
number. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you want to write
it down. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have a follow up,
Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead and I&#39;m sure, can we provide
this to all the committee members at some point, the information?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, move on. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] In 2016, the consensus forecast rate that was completed in the
last week shows that the motor hill tax rate will be an average combined
rate in the next fiscal year of 30.4 cent per gallon. What I was saying
was that in July the rate&#39;s not going to be 30.4, but the July plus
the June, the July and January rate combined would be 30.4. In 2017 the
forecast shows that rate at 31.3 cent per gallon, moving to 33.8 in 2018
and 34.2 in 2019. Moving on to the bill before view, those rates that
start in 2016 at 35 cent per gallon. It&#39;s assumed that the rate will
be below that, but the floor will kick in and bring it up. 2017, 36.4
cent per gallon. 2018, 40.5 cent per gallon. 2019, 41.0 cent per gallon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, that&#39;s excellent. Follow up if I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question, Senator McKissick. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sure, Senator Rabin, I noticed underneath the summary here that
we have for the bill, it indicates in terms of reduction to the highway
trust fund that one of the things that would occur it says by March 1,
2015, a reduction in force of 500 filled full time positions and a
minimum

  <p id="15:00">
  fifty vacant positions within a department. What impact have the folks
at DOT indicated this particular reduction would mean in terms of the
operations of the agency?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that it can be absorbed and absorbed very well. They&#39;re
around thirteen thousand employees at DOT, that =we think this is a very
reasonable number, and it is a way to balance this bill with the budget
and not damage our bridges and contract re-servicing and the true job of
DOT, which is roads and highways and byways of the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow-up, do we have anybody from DOT who&#39;s going to speak
today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have anybody from DOT who&#39;s going to speak on this today at
all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there anyone from DOT present today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Lewis is in the audience.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Mr. Lewis, could you come up, identify yourself, just make sure
you press the button. Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bobby Lewis, Chief of Staff NCDOT.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, Senator McKissick, what is your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just if the DOT has reviewed this particular provision dealing with the
impact upon its staffing effective March 1, assuming this bill goes
forward and are you in concurrence with Senator Rabin&#39;s assessment
that it will have minimal impact upon the agency?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can&#39;t hear that, just-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that better?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m just a country boy, I&#39;m not used to this technology. What I
would say is, full disclosure, there has been some outsourcing
requirements in terms of legislation that we have not put the best foots
forward. So just with that, I think that would get us in compliance with
current legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, okay, I mean, I&quot;ll get with him later, I guess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it&#39;s a good bill overall, I think decreasing this volatility
makes a lot of sense. So I think we&#39;re headed in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator McKissick. Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want some clarification, if you would allow,
from staff. Section 2.2, Mr. Chairman, any time I see a piece of
legislation that has Mecklenburg in it I get skiddish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is not changed, that is the law as it now stands. There is no lines
underlined or nothing drawn through. Just as it is. This is the old law
as a vehicle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. You can understand where I&#39;m coming from. You&#39;ve got
Senator Rucho chairing and Mecklenburg in the bill, so I just want to
make sure, for the general public, that the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, questions are good, speeches aren&#39;t.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Senator Ford, I will say that I read this again this morning because
I was contemplating ?? that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. I got Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe that we have asked DOT in the past on
more than one occasion to make these cuts to the number of employees and
I believe that, in all due respect, they drug their feet and didn&#39;t
do it and now I heard what I thought, Senator McKissick, an answer you
didn&#39;t like. If they could do this without a lot of harm at all?
Thank you, Bobby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, any additional questions, members of the committee? Alright,
seeing none, we&#39;re going to go into the second part of the bill.
Senator Rabin, thank you. You did a great job. Senator Rabin will chair
the meeting at this moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. At this time Senator Rucho is going to go over the IRC
portion of the bill. Senator Rucho, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Members of the committee, if many of you might have been
on revenue laws, we went through this, all of the portions of the IRC
update. Problem that we face, and actually this year is a little better
than in the previous years. When congress decides to make a change in
the tax law, they wait until the very last point and the last time it
was like the 18th or 20th of December, the previous time it was on the
31st. So it puts a lot of pressure on the general assembly to make
decisions as to how were going to either couple or decouple with the
different tax changes that have been promised and passed by congress.
The other difference is that they don&#39;t have to worry about paying
for things. They can just print money up there. So the bottom line is we
do have to live within our means and that&#39;s something that is very
important and part of our decision

  <p id="20:00">
  Process, there are, let&#39;s see, one, two, three, six pieces of this
IRC update. I&#39;m gonna ask Jonathan Tarte in a moment to explain,
I&#39;ll just say to you that in previously assemblies we&#39;ve
decoupled from every one of the portions that we will recommend a
decoupling today. The revenue law study commission, I believe House
unanimous, I think the Senate may have one dissenting vote, all endorsed
this change. If you haven&#39;t heard yet, your accountants, your
business owners are all screaming and yelling we need to know what the
rules are. We are in the process now, this is gonna be a five day bill.
We hope to get it through this committee, through Appropriations today
at 1 o&#39;clock, to the floor Wednesday and Thursday both, on its way
to the House so that they can do that and so that one, the gas tax issue
can be resolved. The issue of IRC is completely clarified and so under
the circumstances we will work to get this through today, out of this
committee and on to Appropriations. There is a cost of coupling with the
IRC changes out of congress, which is about $73 million. That is a
direct reduction, Senator Brown, on availability and as we&#39;ve done
in the past, and I mentioned earlier, every single one that we&#39;re
decoupling we have decoupled in a previous session. Mr. Chairman, can we
have Mr. Tarte explain going from the 179 on down as to what each of
those means and talk about the recommendation from the Revenue Loss
Study Commission. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, thank you, Sir. Mr.
Tarte, would you please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. So we do start with
Federal Income, so as your staff we go through and when we have Federal
legislation we go through and we identify specific provisions that would
have a significant impact on general fund revenues. Again, this
legislation was passed at the end of the year and it&#39;s made
retroactive to January 1, 2014, meaning it is fairly urgent that you
pass this because it does affect tax returns that are currently being
filed. So when we look through this legislation we identified those and
I think I&#39;ll talk from the fiscal note that&#39;s in your packet. If
everyone will flip through there you&#39;ll see the fiscal note
that&#39;s for this bill, and the first item on there is enhanced
section 179, expensing limits. This allows businesses an accelerated
write offs of investments they make during the year. Instead of having
to depreciate them over their useful lives they can, under the Federal
law this was expanded to a ceiling of $500,000 in available deduction,
so the cost of going to that expansion, without the expansion the limit
is $250,000 a year, so this expansion would reduce General Fund revenues
by about $52 million, this specific provision. If you turn over to the
next page, we have one for qualified tuition and expenses deduction
which is for the higher education deduction. If you conform to that one
it would reduce revenues by $1 million. The next one is a deduction to
allow mortgage insurance premiums to be deducted like mortgage interest.
That one would reduce revenues by about $4 million. The fourth one is an
income exclusion for discharge of residents indebtedness which would
reduce revenues by approximately $14 million and then the last one on
the bulleted list is an income exclusion for an IRA distribution to
charity for a person who&#39;s reached 70.5 years of age. That one would
reduce revenues by about $1 million. So these figures I&#39;ve given you
is the estimated cost on the General Fund if you were to simply update
the date reference on the Internal Revenue code and adopt all of these
for North Carolina purposes. This bill does not conform to any of those
provisions and consequently under this bill you would not incur the cost
to the General Fund. Now moving back to the front of the fiscal note,
you&#39;ll see that on the top of there, there is a General Fund Revenue
impact of $-1 million and that is because of conformity to one of the
provisions which is the

  <p id="25:00">
  ...deduction for teacher classroom supplies of up to $250. And so, to
sum it up,  the total of all of these that I&#39;ve talked about would
be a 73 million dollar reduction on general fund revenues if you conform
to all of them. But this bill again does not and only conforms to the
teacher classroom deduction at a cost of 1 million dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman we&#39;d entertain questions from the committee on each of
these issues. Just identify them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Verify which ones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just so that I&#39;m clear on it: the federal
policy was to institute these deductions to sort of help juice the
economy a little bit. But in particularly I&#39;m interested in the
exclusion for discharge of qualified principle residence. Given that
they were trying to bounce people back from some of the predatory
lending practices and various other things that led us to the busting
bubble in 2008 so do I understand this correctly: if you can negotiate
with the mortgage company because you are upside down in a mortgage or
you&#39;re basically gonna participate in a quick sale or something like
that. Although the debt forgiveness is, say $50,000 on a $150,000 house,
the debt forgiveness would be recognized at the federal level. You
wouldn&#39;t have to pay income tax on say that $50,000 difference
between what you owe and what they are willing to write-off. But
we&#39;re gonna charge state income tax on that debt forgiveness from
that mortgage company? Is that it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, that is correct. We coupled the last time and we will do so. We
believe that this is a real dollar figure of 14 million dollars that
will go against availability and under the circumstances the decision
was made to decouple it. Secondly, there are a number of other areas
that aren&#39;t offering the relief from income debt: credit cards and
the like and what we feel is that we are at the end of the issue of home
workouts through the plan that you are describing and we feel that this
is the appropriate time as it was last time to stop that and not effect
the availability of the budget at the level of 14 million dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one follow-up. I know that staff has a number, that&#39;s how
you&#39;re able to compute how much it would cost, a number of dollars,
but do you have any rough estimate of the number of transactions that
this would cover? That is, how many people or homeowners would be
effected?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Stark?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, we did do some research on that. We&#39;ve done this
estimate a couple of ways: one was primarily using tax data and then we
did it a second way, trying to rely on more on housing data and from our
research into housing data we believe it is somewhere between 3500 and
4000 short sales that would be impacted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, as you know, this just effects the state end of it.
They&#39;re still are eligible for the federal side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment on that and then a question on another subject. The real
challenge with this debt relief is that we&#39;re making people come up
with real cash to pay the state department of revenue. If you had a
$100,000 debt write-off on a loan in Mecklenburg County where you were
really underwater - that $100,000 write-off is totally on paper.
It&#39;s just reducing the amount you owe the bank. You&#39;re not
getting cash. So we&#39;re making them treat it as though it was income
that they earned and now they have to pay real taxes to the state which,
if it is 5%, that&#39;s $5000.  That&#39;s cash that they don&#39;t
have. That&#39;s the reason they are in financial problems in the first
place. As you remember, Senator Rucho, I didn&#39;t like this provision
last year and I think it remains problematic. My other question has to
do with the higher education deduction when just saw Institute for
Emerging Issues talking about innovation and the need, what
distinguishes innovative places is having a high education work force
and so we want to do everything we can to help people afford college and
what this does is, as I understand it and please correct me if I&#39;m
wrong, is that it will end up taking away a deduction from middle-class
families who send people to higher education, and if so, why did we do
that?

  Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The issue of
$1 million in the scheme of things is not a lot of money but here&#39;s
the point, if we couple with this it opens up the opportunity for the
Federal Tax or, let&#39;s say, the recipient to either claim a credit or
a deduction on the Federal side and if they do that, then that means
that the state has to accept either the credit or the deduction and
rather than $1 million, it means a $25 million hit against the
availability so we just chose not to go into and complicate the tax
system by decoupling. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And one follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know that
we&#39;ve decoupled from the Earned Income Tax Credit in the past. Just
by the fact that it&#39;s not in this bill, does that mean we&#39;ve
coupled with it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, no, Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Earned Income Tax Credit was
removed the last time and it was replaced by a increase in what the
standard deduction or what we like to call a zero bracket and that
picked up some of that additional savings, but the Earned Income Tax
Credit is no longer in our system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator
Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. Senator Rucho I&#39;ve got a
question for you. When is a tax cut not a good idea? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
When is a tax cut not a good idea? I might have to ponder that for the
remaining part of my life, Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You finally
stumped him. Any further questions from the committee. Hearing none, as
Senator Rucho mentioned earlier this is something that we need to move
on with and so we will entertain a motion to accept the PCS for Senate
Bill 20, unfavorable to the original bill and favorable to the PCS.
Motion by Senator Tillman. Second by Senator Andrews. No more disussion
or debate. All those in favor, please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. Motion carried, Meeting adjourned. No,
meeting is not adjourned. You got another one? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One,
just, no, no more, Mr. Chairman, no more on that bill with Appleby, just
a reminder for everyone that we, the Senate will be in Appropriations
meeting at 1 o&#39;clock in 544 to discuss these issues and then
we&#39;ll be able to go to the floor with it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ve got something that I failed to say a while ago. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think this is important in lieu
of our meeting just now. These three boys were outside in the playground
bragging. One says my daddy&#39;s faster than you all&#39;s daddy, and
he can shoot an arrow at the target and catch the arrow before it hits
the target. The other little boy says my daddy&#39;s faster than that,
he can shoot a 22 and catch the bullet before it hits the tree. The
third little boy came up and said I got you all beat. My daddy works at
DOT and he gets off at 5 o&#39;clock and he&#39;s home at 4:30 every
day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, if there are no other questions or
comments from the committee? Now we can adjourn.
