Ladies and gentlemen, at this time home, we'll call this meeting of
health and human services to order.  I'd like to begin by welcoming our
pages that are with us today, and I'd like to recognize you, if you
would stand and the recognize when a caller name.  Madison Gilliani,
from Mecklenburg County sponsored by representative, I suppose that's
William Brawley.  Ape Commodore, from Cumberland County, sponsored by
Representative Lucas.  Graham Lauder from Wake county, sponsored by
speaker Tillis, and Elizabeth Mazinka from Wake county, sponsored by
representative Stam.  We're happy to have all of you with us, and we
hope you're having a good week at the general assembly.  Very
educational, and a good time.  We're glad to have our sergeant at arms
with us today, Bill Bass, Joe Crook, Carl Morello, and Martha Gadison.
Thank all of you for what you do for us every day.  Members, we have
three bills on our calendar today, and will begin with house bill 580.
We'll ask Representative Martin to come forward and present your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning.  Members of the committee, I know you don't get enough
e-mail, but I hope you had it chance to see the e-mail that I sent out
that a lot of background information on house bill 580, on
tele-psychiatry.  We've had a pilot program in place for the last year
or so that's been really a partnership between ECU school of medicine
and Avamore Hospital foundation, and it's been very successful, and I
met at the joint legislative oversight committee of health and human
services during the innerim and proposed that this be continued and
expanded because of the success.  And we've also seen as implemented on
the state level in South Carolina.  I do have some folks here who have
run the pilot, who are prepared to give you some more background
information, but I think this is really a good strong policy position
for us.  We know we've had a lot of issues with mental health in the
state, and this has come from losing hospital beds and trying to push it
more into the community, but not necessarily having the services
available in the community, so what this will do is allow us to get the
patients in the door sooner and have the skilled people to make an
assessment fee a telemedicine so that in those rural communities, in
places where we don't have access to care, that they would get in, they
wouldn't be sitting in the waiting room and get into the system, they
would have a diagnosis by skilled psychiatrist whose licensed in North
Carolina who could reside somewhere else in the state.  And we would
create that hub across a state what this bill.  So that we get patients
in the door quicker, shorter wait times and appropriate diagnosis.  And
we've seen it this is saved a lot of money and has really improved
access to care and improve patient outcomes.  So it's a small
investment, but it saves a lot of money in the backend and its something
proactive we can do to improve mental health.  So, I think it's a strong
policy.  It is in the senate proposed budget.  The same amount of money,
two million dollars, to move this forward.  And we've seen this work, so
I recommend we move will forward, blessing this proposal, and let the
department work with the different groups that are out there.  There's
actually two groups.  ECU is implementing this, as well as Carolina's
medical center has a hub that is doing this.  So what we want the
department to do is bring it together, make it statewide.  And that is
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comments or questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comments or questions, members of the committee, Representative Brady?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I rise just in support of this bill, also
because of the one of the bill so we passed recently was a telemedicine
bill, and I think these are going to go hand in hand, and I do, when
appropriate, would like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.  If you'll hold that motion.  Representative Farmer Butterfield,
you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was just going to ditto what the gentleman just said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good.  And the other members to speak?  If not, Representative
Brady, you're recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'd like to make a motion for favorable to
report on house bill 580.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Represented Brady moves for a favorable report for house bill 580.  All
members in support, signify by saying aye.  All opposed, no.  The ayes
have it, and Representative Martin, it looks like you have house bill
973 as well, so if you'd like to precede with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  House bill 973 addresses a similar issue</p>

<p id="05:00">
As I mentioned, we have a transition from the statewide beds to the
community beds, and the community beds are three-way contract beds, and
the recommendation also came into the legislative oversight committee
that we needed to consider having two-tiered payment system for higher
acuity mental crisis patients that are in the community, that the
funding that we have for a bed in the community , which is 750 dollars
per bed day, is not sufficient for higher acuity patients, and the
hospitals were losing money and not necessarily bringing the patients
in, and then there’s the lack of availability of the state beds, which
are for the most severe acuity, so the whole point of this is to get the
patient… first we dealt with evaluation, but to get them into the
appropriate beds, so we want to provide funding to support our community
hospitals, and they need a little more money for these higher, more
severe cases. So this came also out of the oversight recommendation, and
we want it to be less funding than what is in the psychiatric hospital
because if they need that level of care then we want them to get a bed
in the psychiatric hospital, but one thing of note is in 2001 we had a
total of 3,483 beds, combining what we had in the state hospitals and in
the community and as both have moved, in 2012 we had 2,665 beds, so we
haven’t done very… we haven’t been as successful as we would have liked
in replacing those beds from the state hospitals to the community, and
some of that will be improved in the budget, but also going to two tier
payment will help the folks, and I think there’s an amendment. I don’t
know who’s offering that amendment. Is he here? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
amendment sponsor’s not here. Is it an amendment that you wanted
offered, or…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it’s the technical amendment on
the dates in section 1b. Do you want me to put it under my name?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you want to sign it, we’ll go ahead and send it
forth. Members will be at ease while the amendment is being passed out.
I would also bring your attention that in the previous motion for House
Bill 580, we did not mention that it is referred to Appropriations.
Without objection, we’d like to do that. We’ll so note. Is this
regarding the amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Regarding the bill before we
get to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Martin, the beds that
we’re contemplating here are existing hospital beds in general hospitals
that will be contracted for to be used an psychiatric beds for a
temporary period of time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, they are existing and
new three-way contract beds, and under the budget we have tried I think
to get 45 more beds funded last year, but because of the Medicaid
shortfall they did not get in there, but they should be in there this
year, so for all of our three-way contract beds to make this second tier
available, up to two million dollars, which would not be all of them all
the time. It would be a percentage of them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up,
Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] How many
total beds then would that be annually, that this two million would make
available? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s see. I have the two… I think it… I
believe that the three-way contract beds would be 186, but I would need
to double-check, which is in the Senate budget where they are outlining
the three-way contract beds from 141 to 186 by allocating the funds that
were in last year’s budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up again. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And does that still leave a shortfall
in regards to what’s required? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it does. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And what would that be? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not have that
number here, but I’m happy to show you this presentation with you where
we can go over it afterwards, but I believe</p>

<p id="10:00">
[Speaker changes.] That is part of the reason why you might see
additional hospital...state hospital beds proposed on top of the
three-way beds.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Fulghum, I think we have a
representative from physical research here that could answer that
question. If you would please state your name.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, Denise Thomas, physical research division.
Representative Fulghum, who asked the question about how many beds we
have right now or...we have...you have funded enough right now for 186
beds so two million would be...we'd have to calculate that since it's
tied, I think to an elevated...I mean to an increased rate so that
would...we'd have to get that information from the department after they
decide what this higher rate would be.
[Speaker changes.] Members, do you have a copy of an amendment before
you? Representative Martin, you're recognized to explain your amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. I'd like to defer to staff to explain the
provision.
[Speaker changes.] The amendment..when the amendment was drafted, it
just restates Section 1B entirely so that the members could see the
amendment in context but what has changed...if you refer to the bill on
line 26...it adds a reporting requirement currently in Section 1B of the
bill. It requires the department to report by March 1st, 2014, regarding
the efficacy in the success rate of the actual three-way contract and
the assessment of the two tiered system of payment. What this amendment
would do would also ask them to report by June 30th, 2013, what the
description is of the performance measures. The amendment essentially
would require a description of the performance measures that are being
used to give the report to the General Assembly on March 1st, 2014, so
that if the General Assembly were to have any problems or issues with
performance measures being used, that adjustments could be made before
the March 1st, 2014 report was due.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Insko, is this on the amendment? Do
you have a question on the amendment?
[Speaker changes.] I think it's on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Ok...Members, any comments or questions on the
amendment? Seeing none, Representative Martin moves for passage of
Amendment...I believe it's ATJ38, B1. All in favor signify by saying
&quot;aye&quot;. (Ayes.) All opposed,no. The ayes have it and the
amendment does pass so now we're back on the bill. Representative Insko,
you're recognized to speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I apologize for not being
here when the discussion was started. I sent some questions of
last..er...yesterday I think about this bill...maybe to somebody in
fiscal...but I'd like to have some comparison about the cost that we pay
for our state hospital beds as compared to the cost that we pay for our
local inpatient beds.  I don't know whether anybody from fiscal has that
information.
[Speaker changes.] I don't know if you..I don't know that they have a
fiscal note or viewed it online.  I did include that in the email...a
link to that so if you don't have it, you can pull up the details. And
they have...from fiscal research that the state hospital beds are
?????????? 920, Central Regional 1107 and Cherry???? 1417.  Right now,
the community three-way bed is 750 and in the bill, it proposes it to be
not more than the lowest hospital one so I think kinda' when we did the
math, if we were to say...half of the patients, half of the time...would
be a higher acuity and what kind of a number would it be, we used $900
but we're asking staff to come up with that...we're asking the
department, not staff...we're directing the department to determine what
is an appropriate higher acuity level in the community setting.
[Speaker changes.] Then I have a follow up question.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up.
[Speaker changes.] We used to have LME's that had agreements with their
local hospitals for inpatient beds at no cost to the state and I'm
wondering if there are any of those LME's that currently are providing
inpatient beds at no cost to the state. That was a problem because when
we started paying for beds, the people who were doing it voluntarily
were then wanting to also be paid for their beds...so I'm just
curious....</p>

What this is all about, and what we hope to achieve with it, and why I
think it is one of the best directions we can take for the children in
our foster care system today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila, you have a speaker you wanted to
present?  If you would sir, please come and state your name and who
you're with for the committee, for the record, and you are recognize for
a period not to exceed 3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Brian Manis, I'm with the Children's Home
Society of North Carolina, I'm always cautious when someone says I will
be eloquent, I'm doomed for failure for that.  The Children’s Home
Society was established in 1902. We are one of North Carolinian’s
leading organizations in the areas of adoption, family preservation, and
family support services.  Our mission has been consistent throughout our
history, that's to promote the right of every child  to a permanent,
safe, and loving family.  We have completed about 15,000 adoptions in
our history.  This year we'll work with about 1,000 children and
families who are involved in our child welfare system and our foster
care system.  We complete about 25% of all adoption work for children in
foster care.  We do a little bit more than half of all the work that's
done by private organizations.  This bill is very important for a number
of reasons.  We believe children do best when they are part of and
raised by a family.  We believe government makes a poor parent, and the
outcomes for children who spend long periods of time in foster care or
who age out of foster care really prove that to be true.  And what this
bill does is addresses the children who languish in foster care.
Children's Home Society works in partnership with our Department of
Health and Human Services, and our County Departments of Social
Services.  We work with about 75 county DSSes in any given year.  The
adoption promotion fund which is featured bill 971 is critical to
supporting adoption work in North Carolina for these children in foster
care.  The trend has been that funding for the adoption promotions fund
has been decreasing, and this is due largely by cuts in federal funding
which have supported that fund, but the reverse is true for children who
are aging out of foster care in our state.  So last fiscal year 574
children were placed for adoption via the special children's adoption
promotion fund or the adoption fund as it's also know as.  Meanwhile,
603 children aged out of foster care in that same year.  And that trend
is increasing.  More kids who are aging out without the benefit of a
family that's there to support them into adulthood.  That trend is bad
for children and is bad for our state.  So that outcomes are really bad,
and I have a colleague that will speak for just a second around some of
those outcomes. And the outcome for our state is bad, because we incur a
huge cost to maintain these children in foster care, and then we all pay
for the poor outcomes that they experience as adults.  What Children's
Home Society brings to our public partners is our expertise in
permanency work, as well as relationships with private funders across
the state.  And we've been fortunate to enjoy many relationships with
private funders who have funded some real innovative work with us for
the last 10 years.  The services that are featured in house bill 971 are
really a product of that private investment and innovation.
Specifically the services that are outlined around family engagement and
called family finding, and child-specific adoption recruitment.  So
several foundations, the Duke Endowment, the Thomas Foundation, the Edna
McConnell Clark Foundation, have invested more than 12 million dollars
over the last 5 years to develop these services in North Carolina, all
private investment.  In addition, our family finding program was
recognized by the federal social innovation fund, and was awarded a 3
million dollar, 3 year investment, due to it's innovative approach and
promising outcomes.  All of that funding, and those funding sources will
participate in this demonstration project, and that will leverage the
state dollars that would be invested in this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll introduce Matt Anderson, prior to his role with
Children's Home Society, he  was the producer of film that
Representative Avila mentions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Anderson, you're recognized for a period not to
exceed 3 minutes if you would please state your name and who you
represent.

<p id="30:00">
Thank you all for taking the time today, and especially Representative
Avila for your work on this.  I also do not have a personal experience.
I was not in foster care, nor have I adopted any children from foster
care, but I really can't imagine a more important thing to work on than
these particular issues, so thank you.
I'd like to start by saying that House Bill 971 is about fulfilling our
promise of a family for every child in foster care.  Our federal
policies, state priorities require that we involve the biological
family, that we put in place a strong support system for these children,
that we place children with a safe, permanent family, and we do
everything we can to set them up for success in adulthood.  An example
of this is the 2008 Fostering Connections Act that required states to
notify and engage all relatives of children that had been placed in
foster care.  Five years later, North Carolina, like most states,
struggle to meet this requirement.  Part of what we are trying to
accomplish with this Bill and our Family Finding Program is to make sure
that we cannot only meet this requirement to these children, but go well
beyond that.  Today, there are over 8,600 children living in foster
care, all of whom are trusting all of us that we will do what we can to
meet our obligations to them.  The cost of maintaining these children in
foster care can be as high as $54,000 a year per child, and that's just
direct foster care maintenance payments.  The additional administration,
court, Medicaid costs can drive those costs even higher.
Last year over 2,000 children were waiting to be placed with a family to
call their own, and our Adoption Promotion Fund accomplished 574
adoptions.  We see that gap between those numbers as the opportunity to
provide the benefits of a family to more children in foster care as well
as to reduce the costs associated with maintaining children in foster
care.  As Brian mentioned, 603 children aged out of foster care last
year.  These children, we know, will suffer outcomes such as
homelessness, incarceration, unemployment, unplanned pregnancy, all of
which will bring upon their own costs, well into adulthood.  For
example, among those youth who age out, 75% of women will use government
benefits in adulthood, such as food stamps.  Seventy-five percent of the
women will also become pregnant.  Seventy-seven percent of the men will
be arrested, and 29% of whom will be incarcerated.  There's a handout
that was sent out to you all that will show some of the costs associated
with these outcomes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Anderson, if you would, try and wrap up your
remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes.  I'll close by saying House Bill 971 has four
broad goals; one, to reduce the number of children in foster care; two,
to reduce the length of stay in foster care; three, to reduce the number
of children aging out; and lastly, to increase the number of children
that achieve legal permanency and the benefits of being connected to
their biological family.  I'll close.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Anderson.  Members, before I recognize
Representative Avila for a motion, further comments or questions?
Representative Brady?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Actually, for one of the
speakers, if they wouldn't mind.  On the left-hand side of your sheet,
you had the number of statistics, and I was wondering if you could
answer this?  Let's say 20 years ago, and it's just a number I picked
out of a hat--20 years ago, were these statistics the same, or are we
seeing, overall, an improvement of this problem, or going the opposite
direction?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  If you would, again, please state your name for the
record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Sure, my name is Brian Manus with the Children's Home
Society of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think we have seen some improvement as a state over
the last 10 or 15 years.  I've been with the Children's Home Society
about a dozen years.  When I came to work with Children's Home Society
we had about 12,000 children in foster care in the state.  You heard
Matt mention that we have about 8,600 children in foster care today, so
we have made some progress.  That doesn't mean we don't have more
potential to continue to improve.  I will say one of the key things, in
terms of achieving that progress that we have made, has been the
Adoption Promotions Fund, which is specifically targeted adoption for
children in foster care, and that's what's been cut in the most recent
budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative ?? will be recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  A question for the sponsor.  Are you satisfied that
the 6.75 million dollars over two years is...</p>

evenly distributed to the agencies, not only including the Children's
Home Society, but all the others that are in foster care and adoption
work in the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This particular demonstration is directed at Children's Home Society in
terms of its expertise in having use this family finding and the other
methods they want to expand in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe a question for the Children's Home Society.  I'm sure you're aware
of the total number of children in foster care and adoptions.  What
percentage does the Children's Home Society serve of the total?  And
what is the total?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you would, identify yourself again.  Sure.  My name is Brian Maness
with the Children's Home Society.  Any given year, we will serve about
250 children in our foster care programs.  We will place about 120 or so
children for adoption from foster care this year, and you can compare
that percentage to the total population of about 8600 children in care,
about 2000 of whom have a plan of adoption.  In terms of the scope of
adoption work, we do 25% of all the adoption work for children in foster
care in the state, and a little bit more than half of the work that is
done by private, non-profit organizations in the state.  We're by far
the largest adoption provider in the state and I believe we're the
largest provider of foster care as well.  We'll serve over 1000 children
and families that are involved in the public system this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Szoka, your're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I have a question in the adoption promotion fund.
 What exactly does--does that do?   How do those dollars affect what
you're talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And again, every time you speak, just recognize yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Got it.  Brian Maness with the Children's Home Society of North
Carolina.  So the adoption promotions fund, my understanding, has
existed for about 15 years now, and it supports adoption work for both
public, meaning county departments of social services, and private
organizations like the Children's Home Society.  And there are well over
a dozen private organizations that receive support for the adoption
promotions fund.  It's administered in different ways for the public
sector versus the private.  The public sector agencies, the county
DSS's, have an established baseline based on their past performance of a
number of adoptions they've completed, and they get an incentive from
the adoptions promotions fund for every adoption that exceeds their
established baseline.  For all the private organizations, we work under
performance-based contracts.  So we don't get any funding for our
adoption program unless we complete adoptions. And that reimbursement
comes after the decree of adoption is issued.  And about roughly half of
the adoption promotions fund is awarded to private organizations, and
about half to public county departments of social services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question for the gentleman.  I know he's tired of giving us his
name [laughter]. What age is it hard to place children?  I mean, what--I
know you said that some will stay in your system until they age out, but
what--what age does it get difficult for young men and young women get
to be adopted by families, please sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My--my answer with that--and I'll say I 'm not a social worker--although
I've worked with the Children's Home Society for a long time, but it's
all based on the needs of the child.  So you can have very young
children with very complex needs, and finding the right family for those
kids can be a real challenge.  It is--understood--it's harder to find
families for older children and those with more complex needs.  That's
given.  I think one of the things that we've learned and we've really
challenged assumptions is that we've placed a lot of older kids for
adoption.  So, if you look at three different age brackets:  0-5; 6-12;
and 13 and over, we--our placements are roughly a third in each
category.  So, we can find homes for older children.  It's different.
When people typically think of adoption, they're thinking of infants and
younger--young children.  But there are families that are interested in
providing families for the--for those older kids as well
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many sibling groups do you handle with that?  Brother-sister,
that--is that common in your business?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very common.  I don't have a statistic for you, but we work with sibling
groups all the time. And it's a real priority of ours to keep siblings
together whenever we can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got three more members at this time. Members, we will take a vote
by ten minutes 'till [sic].  Representative Palmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I wanted to ask the gentleman a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. You're recognized for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  The first question [end of data]</p>

thing we know that all speak to this service is good and the five
specifically and health bill 971, I think about it, from myself 5
minutes with the children from Tucson from that good job specific
recruitment and the model of program that we followed was developed by
the day, starvation for adoption as companies were for kids and it says
the children in the program were three times to play older children are
three times more likely to achieve adoption and children that were not
in that program this was severe mental health issues for 127 times more
likely to that realization that option and that was proven to know when
the mouse control from valuation for family fun in our results of them
really phenomenal and I think that's one of the reasons why we were
awarded this investment from the Federal social nation five were
extremely successful engaging family so they really challenges to the
assumption that for children in Foster Care and the biological family
