Henry M. Michaux:
A very odd situation for me, but let me tell you, this has been on the
books in Durum County since 1935. It says that any gun purchase must be
registered with the clerk of court. And this was aimed at a problem they
were having with so called liquor houses is Durum at the time, where
they were having problems. The laws have changed since then. Gun
registration and everything has been taken through another method; we
just want to get this off the books in Durum County. Ask for your

[speaker change]
Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[speaker change]
Jeff Collins:
I’ll briefly explain the bill.
[speaker change]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker change]
Jeff Collins:
This bill, although it looks long, and again, if you remember any
pension bill we’re bring you looks long, because every paragraph gets
repeated over and over again until we’ve covered all the retirement
plans, actually does three things. Section one has an anti-pension
spiking provision in it. If you’ll notice on page one, lines 20 and 21,
this will affect less than three quarters of one percent of state
employees. If you’ll look on page two of your bill, line nine, it also
cannot affect any employee who’s making less than 100 thousand dollars.
So, we’re not talking about the rank and file state employees here. The
benefit cap formula that’s been come up with here is pretty complicated.
I don’t think we need to get into it. What you do need to know is that
on page three, pension spiking is not outlawed by this bill. It can
still be practiced. But what happens is this, if you’ll look starting at
about line 12 section 1-C on page three. If a member’s, has, is
determined to have, a member and his employer by the way, have decided
to commit pension spiking, then the amount which is owed the pension
plan, in order to make the pension plan whole, is determined. And that
member can offer a lump sum to do that. And there’s nothing in here that
prohibits the employer from doing that. Now remember, to accomplish
pension spiking, an employee and his or her employer, have to conspire
to do this basically. So what the legislation is saying, if you want to
do pension spiking, fine you can do it, but you’ve got to pay for it.
You’ve got to make the retirement plan whole in order to do that. And,
in case you’re wondering, the league of municipalities and the county
commissioner’s association are both in favor of this bill, and they
represent those who could be affected, because the cities and counties
could be the employers that are doing the</p>

<p id="010:00">
pension spiking. We know of no opposition of this bill, and this is
probably the most controversial provision in it. The second thing that
it does, if you look at section two, is that we used to say if you are
in the state retirement plans and you see-- you terminate employment for
whatever reason, you'll get your contributions back, and if you've been
with the state more than 5 years, you'll also get interest on those
contributions. Section two does away with that 5-year provision; we
found out, I think, we're the only state, or one of only few states
that's actually getting an interest free loan from those people who
don't work with us at least 5 years. So we'll doing away with that 5
year provision. In section 3, if you'll look at that, what we're doing
is, there's a lot of repeats in there. The year 2011 is struck several
times in there, and out of a 10 year mention is struck several times in
there. What that does is take us back to 5-year vesting for pension
purposes only. Again, remember this is the pension bill, this has
nothing to do with health insurance or anything else. What we found is
the-- going from five years to 10 years in pension vesting really didn't
save us the money that we thought it was going to save us. Also, it is
-- this is a benefit to our employees, by the way, including our
teachers. Also, it helps our state agencies and probably municipal
agencies as well, recruit people when they don't have to wait 10 years
to vest in their pension. Again, I know of no organized opposition to
this bill and would ask your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion? Further debate? Representative Blucas please state
your purpose.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Collins would yield for questions.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]
Representative Collins, does this gentlemen yield?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd be honored to.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep, Collins, thank you Mr. Speaker. Rep. Collins, one of the
reasons given when we went to the 10-year plan was that we wanted to
curb fault coming from coming from other states and working five years
in getting vested. Is that going to be a problem with this?[SPEAKER
CHANGES]
I'm not - I don't know that I'm qualified to answer that question.
This-- yeah, this is about vesting. Would you repeat the-- what you said
was the premise again? I'm not sure I caught--[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Premise was that we would having fault coming from other states across
state lines. Working 5 years-- being vested in qualifying for
retirement. Would that be a problem with this-- this scenario that
you've presented to us now?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It might be, again, if you work -- if nothing changes any formulas. If
you've worked five years, you're only going to get that 1.8 multiplier,
whatever multiplied by 5, so I'm not sure -- I guess but it could, I
guess if before you get no pension whatsoever, then you'd get nothing.
If you work 5 years now under this 5 year vesting, I guess you'd get 9%
of whatever you were making. If you were a legislature, you'd get
maybe-- what would that be? A hundred bucks a month? Or something like
that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's another question they've been asking.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is anything in your provisions that's going to hurt the state
financially?
This came from the treasurers department as a request from the
treasurers department. So, since they're in charge of the retirement
plan, they don't believe this will hurt the state retirement.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.[SPEAKER CHANGES]

…Is a companion bill of House Bill 735 which passed last year through
the House with every republican vote and some by partisan support. This
body just passed another bill that clarified to those people that need
clarification, the K12 students and their teachers do not lead their
constitutional rights of freedom of speech or religious expression at
the school house gate when they enter. So, the bill before today it
makes the same type of clarification on behalf of the rights of college
students. At least these issues were not controversial but unfortunately
they are, this bill clearly affirm the student organizations and
colleges campuses maintain the right to determine their organization’s
core functions and resolve their own internal disputes not the college
or university administration, this bill will prohibit the administration
from denying recognition to those organizations simply for exercising
their rights to determine their own core functions but if you comment
and questions that were raised in the committee that I want to briefly
address, we need to make it clear that just because the student decides
to attend one of our public universities or colleges that does not
somehow mean that the student forfeits his right to administration or at
the university or the college. Colleges do have an important role on to
the law when it comes to granting recognition to student groups. This
bill does not change that but this bill also recognizes that there is an
important difference between education and indoctrination or conversion.
Citizens do have first amendment rights that project their freedom
speech and religious expression and those rights extended to students in
our state universities and colleges. Now, some of them ask why this is
necessary and unfortunately it is necessary. Our society is engaged in a
ongoing cultural battle those who rules against God in the public square
and against Christian expression in particular and unfortunately these
efforts have the standard to our campuses, they have been reported
efforts to religious student organizations have been threatened with
non-recognition, denied access to university facilities, or otherwise
harass because of their religious beliefs, there have been efforts to
muzzle their speech, efforts to mandate whom they must accept their
leaders or members and efforts to abridge their freedom of association.
This bill and the house companion bill that we have already passed
protect student organizations through such improper discrimination by
universities and colleges on the basis of their religious beliefs. As
far as any farfetched examples of what could possibly be allowed
obviously if someone stay to religious beliefs or threat to the safety
of others or otherwise violate the law those examples would not be
protected by this bill but it does stop those that would invoke the
power of their office to impose their beliefs just ___[03:27] for others
but otherwise it bans an agenda of indoctrination or conversion. Members
of the house we have a very good vote on the house companion bill and I
again ask for your support today, thank you.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker and members and I send this amendment by
email this morning to Representative Johns, we haven’t had a chance
because of all the other committees meeting today to actually talk about
it but I certainly didn’t wanna surprising it all on the floor with it.
We had some of this debate the other day and the committees so I will
try to setup the background for it and for this amendment. The bills did
pass I think corresponding bills last year there was much debate and
discussion over the policy and pretty much on a partisan line vote which
I’m hoping we can avoid today. As a result of that it was my
understanding that the universities board of Governors was getting ready
to adopt a policy which would have I think negated the necessity for
this bill. I thought there was some agreement to do that but that’s
probably best way for debate on the bill itself nonetheless it was clear
that the universities and the board were engaged in discussions and
campuses were passing their own policies. My concern in the committee
the other day was three fold one that we not be contradicting or passing
a statue which was contradicting board of Governor’s policy that was
getting ready to pass as well as university polices at different
campuses, second that we be consistent and saying at the front end to
the extend a law by student Federal Law that we also be consistent with
the equal opportunity policies on campuses and not put universities in a
position where we were likely to set them up for litigation but most
importantly it was in the second little ‘I’ in each paragraph. I think
it is correct to say that this bill actually does change the role of the
university in granting recognition but it’s designed to do that. So, I
know sponsors don’t believe that to be true, I believe that’s exactly
what it does but I don’t know that there is anything unconstitutional
about that, that’s a policy matter, it may not be a good policy or maybe
a bad but what is a real problem is the second little subsection, the
argument was made the other day by Senator ___[02:50] in committee that
although we want leadership in organizations to be faithful to the
mission of that organization and that’s what subsection will allowed us
that we wanna have a diversity policy with regard to who can join clubs
and organizations on campus because that’s part of being at a university
and also allowing those clubs and organizations to function and grow.
The subsection 2 does the opposite because what subsection 2 does is it
says specifically that the organization may limit themselves with
respect to how the Governor organization has two policies that they
adopt in written form. An organization therefore, and I talk to
university council and I have talked to a number of lawyers since
yesterday and as far as I can tell they are in pretty much agreement
that unless we modify that little subsection what can happen is as a
classic example assume that there is a group on campus and we call it
for odd purposes the student KKK club. And an African-American
___[04:04] decides that they wanna join that club and they agree that
despite their status whether that’s for color or religion they agree
with the policies of that club which may well be true in some cases,
what Senator ___[04:21] said, “The bill would allows that the person
will then have the right to be a member of that organization.” And I
think that’s a good thing I think that’s the correct response but what
those provisions says is, “If the student organizations membership
criteria and their written policies says, but because of the nature of a
club we are not going to allow anyone Jewish or black to be a member of
our group than that’s what controls?” And I don’t think that’s what the
sponsors intend but that is in effect with the words say. So, my
amendment is trying to get at the broad policy issues it’s not trying to
change the role that the…

<p id="025:00">
the majority wants for the university and its governance, but it is
trying to get at that one issue, so if you look at what I have drafted
with the help of others, and, after talking with counsel at a number of
universities, it says: &quot;To the extent allowed by state and federal
law, and consistent to the institutions EO policies, a religious or
political student organization may, in conformity with their written
doctrine, their established written doctrine, not the doctrine they
create on the spur of the moment, not the doctrine that's created by
amendment to deal with one specific issue, it's got to be established
written doctrine, that expresses their faith or mission, and they can
determine the persons who profess faith or mission to then be the ones
they chose for leadership, and they may then, as a result, as well,
limit membership and participation in their organization to students who
upon inquiry affirm their faith in that organization's mission.&quot; So
if someone wants to be, as Representative Stam said the other day, wants
to be a Democrat invading a Republican club to take it over, aside from
the fact the Republican club could pass an attendance policy to stop
that from happening, in all to get enough Republicans there to stop it.
If they believe in the organization that this person is not, in effect,
really committed, what they're trying to do is infiltrate the
organization to devolve it, to dissolve it, the organization will have
the ability to deal with that. What they may not do under this amendment
that they apparently do have the right to do under the bill that I'm
trying to stop is they can't say to me, in that KKK example, Well, you
may agree with us, but you're Jewish and we don't want any Jews in the
club, or you're black and you can't be in the club. It distinguishes
between status and belief. The organization has a right to make sure
that the people who join it have a belief. I think that in fact is the
law, and I think that's what the sponsors intend, but what they don't
have a right to do, and what will put the university in instant
litigation, in my view, all across the state, is to declare someone,
because of the color of their skin, or their religion, or their gender,
that they may not be a member of this group, even if they actually
profess faith and belief to the organization's missions. That's the
problem I'm trying to solve, forget all the others, we can debate those.
So, with that in mind, because I believe it does what it needs to do to
make the distinguishing characteristic between belief and status, what
Senator Soucek said the bill was intended to do. I move adoption of my
amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I oppose the amendment for about three reasons. First, if you'll look on
line nine and ten, which applies to UNC and it's the same issue at
community colleges. The first little phrase there, &quot;to the extent
allowed by state and federal law&quot; is just surplusage because of
course we're governed by federal law and the state law involved is this
law itself, but the real kicker is the next line, &quot;and consistent
with the constituent institutions Equal Opportunity policies.&quot;
That's exactly the problem. We had all these PC institutions setting up
speech codes and requirements for organizations and others will speak to
the Supreme Court decision that necessitated this. That sets the UNC
Board of Governors, which for a moment happens to be Republican
majority, but who knows in the far future, sets their decisions up above
the organization's own internal  mission, and that it what is wrong.
Now, we go down to the bottom here, about this scenario about some KKK
group. I remember thirty years ago, when we had the Equal Access Act
passed by the Congress, signed by President Reagan, that gives equal
access in secondary education for bible clubs and things like that, on
an equal basis with any other extracurricular activity during
non-instructional time. At that time, we had people talking about
&quot;Oh, there's going to be witch's covens meeting in all the high
schools of America, we're going to have terrorist groups, we're going to
have white supremacist groups claiming this equal access.&quot; It
hasn't happened. The same, now Representative Glazier is claiming that
we're going to have people trying to form KKK groups on UNC campuses,
but then he has the takeaway from the KKK group, you could then have the
Republicans trying to take over the Democrats who only have</p>

Members there and all they have to do, to take over the group is give a
written statement where a firm that they support their goals. Well,
guess what? I bet the goals of the Democratic party are so wonderful
that even with a good conscious I could probably support those goals if
I wink and nod about it. I urge you to defeat this amendment which guts
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen's recognize to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Speaker as the primary sponsor of the identical house
companion bill I strongly urge my colleague to oppose this amendment. I
think Representative Stamm said it well, but it changes the bill. It
weakens the bill. It guts the bill. It's not what the sponsors intended
and I ask for you to oppose the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak a second time to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen
has recognized to debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Speaker and I'll be brief. So, Representative Stamm, in
response to his comments. If, I was seeking to gut the bill I would
never have sent the amendment this morning to Representative Jones to
read and prepare, I'd just simply sprung it on the house floor which
would have been perfectly my right to do so. I didn't do that because
that wasn't the intent. Secondly, I appreciate the fact that the board
of governors can change, in fact, the board of governors who wanted to
pass a policy today was dominantly appointed by the majority members, is
Republican controlled, and this amendment is consistent with the policy
they were attempting to pass, that you are now taking away from them
today. Forward, this is not an attempt to get at the core issue which is
to make sure that the university complies with not a political
correctness test, but it actually moves them from a limited public forum
to a more open public forum, which I think is the intent of subsection A
and it doesn't touch that, but it very much does touch exactly what the
case law touches on and I'm sort of tired, I guess saying the same thing
but there is a big difference between your status and you're belief and
while we can't solve everything here we can at least make sure that we
are not creating a policy that is in violation of equal opportunity on
campuses that causes more problems than it answers and to the extent
that there's a problem that the majority has with equal opportunity, we
have a bigger problem than this bill on the floor. I thought we were all
committed to that, regardless of where it plays out and to the extent
that Representative Stamm suggests that the problem with this amendment
is in the term equal opportunity, that's precisely we're trying to get
at which is we don't, we may keep people out of organizations if we
chose to do so because we don't believe that they're faithful to the
mission but we don't keep them out because they're black, we don't keep
them out because they're Hispanic, we don't keep them out because
they're Baptist or Jew and it works all different ways and that's all
that's attempting to do and to the extent the majority fells otherwise,
well that's a disappointment but that is what this amendment is
attempting to do. I urge it's adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Jones, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly debate
the bill under the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentlemen's recognize to debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. I did want to take the opportunity
to thank my friend Representative Glazier for emailing me today
unfortunately I apologize I've been committee meetings all day, I didn't
see it, but I appreciate the gesture. I wanted to acknowledge that but
ladies and gentlemen we did have this debate in the whatever committee
we had in here. My mind is tired and it failed miserably there and I do
ask for you to oppose the amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm
speaking on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen's recognize
to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I am in support of this bill
but I'm also to support it's amendment because it did, we did talk about
this in education committee and Representative, I mean Senator Siouxchek
made it very clear that exactly what we were talking about was not the
case but now is the case. There are lots of us on both sides of the
aisle that would love to support this bill. I clearly have been in
support of all of these bills that come through because I think it's
very important to clarify the rights of students in the public schools.
What they are able to do and what they're not able to do but what we
should not be doing in this body and it's very clear from the board of
governors what the policy that they're trying to implement today and
through all the universities is that we do not discriminate based off of
people, of cuz of who they are. We, everybody has their rights including
the African American that wants to join the KKK Club. That is also a
right and so it's just as much as a right for every single person to be
able to exercise their religious beliefs on campuses and I think that
the bill.</p>

...this broader term does that and I support that but there is no way
that people on our side of the aisle...most people they'll be able to
support a policy that says because of who you are you can't join
something. Yes we did pass it out of the education committee but we were
misled about where it was. Now that we have clarified that, I think it's
incumbent upon this group to be able to make the best bill that we can
have. Make sure that we don't have much litigation and we don't put our
universities’ intel with organizations and litigation that has to go
forth. It's a very simple amendment, it does not change anything about
the broader base of it but it does allow us to have broad support and
continue to move in, all without litigation. I, [??], support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The agenda right now is to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I think
the reason we're down here is a very good reason to oppose this
amendment. We ought to read the amendment. You have to basically square
to being of one like mind in order to join the organization. I don't
think any organization is going to survive very long if everybody in it
has to follow one line and one path and if you believe in diversity, I
don't think you want that either. I'm going to ask that you vote down
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not the question before the house is the passage of the amendment to
the senate committee substitute of senate bill 719.  All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote
[silence]
The clerk will let the machine record the vote. Forty four have voted in
the affirmative, 71 in the negative. The amendment fails. We are now
back on the bill.  Further discussion, further debate.  Representative
Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized. Send forth an amendment.
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall wants to amend the bill on
page one, lines 22 through 23 by rewriting the lines to read…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, house.
During education committee I had the opportunity to speak with
Representative Jones as we considered this bill and talk about the
amendment concerns that I have. They're reflected in the amendment
before you. And what this amendment does is say that there will be some
type of appeal procedure for a member of these groups, and individual,
who has already met whatever the group criteria is to be a member and
has achieved, either through election or whatever process the group has,
a leadership position. If they are removed or accused of somehow not
being faithful to the cause that they will have some type of appeal
procedure within that organization. That is all the amendment does. It
just makes sure we not only assure the rights of the organization to
exist but also that we assure the rights of the members of that
organization to have an appeal should they be removed from a position
they achieved under the rules. This again requires the organization, not
the university. The university has no control over these organizations.
This is for the organization to have a reveal or appeal process for the
organization's individual members. So I ask your support on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative Hall
and I appreciate the discussion that we had in the committee and as we
briefly had a chance to talk about it at the end, I would simply say
that I would oppose the amendment. I would really like to see this bill
completed. We passed it in the house. This bill is passed to the senate.
I'd like to see it completed and moved forward. I really don't think
that it's necessary, quite frankly, that the legislature has to make
this decision. I think the way that the bill currently written is
perfectly fine and perhaps this is a measure that we can talk about on
another day, but for this particular bill in its particular form that it
is, I'd like for it to go forward and I would ask that you oppose the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The agenda right now is to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Representative
Jones. I do note that there is really no objection been expressed to
individual members of the organization having a right to a review or
appeal and so if we're going to be about individuals rights as well as
these organizations rights, it would seem we would want them to have an
opportunity to go before their peers and their organization and get a
fair shake if they're willing to put themselves forward for leadership.
So again I would ask you to support the amendment as there is really no
objection to it.</p>

The gentlemen has recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
Thank you mr. speaker and once again I do appreciate my friends
discussion on this. However I think this particular bill seeks to allow
a student organization, if you will, to determine it's own purpose. I
don't fully understand all the repercussions but I don't want allow an
individual, lets say, to go in perhaps with the wrong motivation to try
to hurt that organization and I just think that this could have
ramifications that we're not comfortable with. I'd like more time to
look at it, perhaps in another venue, another bill. I just ask that you
allow this bill to go further as it stands today and please appose this
amendment. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd be more temped with the amendment if it required a process of appeal
to the full organization rather then to the leadership. The organization
it's self can set where the appeal would go.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lades recognized to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladys and gentlemen of the house, I was in the
education comity when we debated the bill. I had some concerns then. I
have some concerns now. I know that there's probably not anyone of this
floor that has probably worked with students as long as I have on a
university college campus and who have as much respect for students
rights. But I also know that the university have responsibilities as
well and when I asked the bill sponsor in the comity if he had spoken to
any of the universities he said he did not, he had spoken to a number of
students and while this bill is drafted for students, I know how
important it is to support them because I've had a bill for a number of
years to give the students a vote on the board of governess. They could
have a vote and could be talking about this issue. I also reached out to
a number of universities in my district and some not in my district and
asked there legal folk about this bill and the impact that it would
have. I think my first concern about it is that while we are trying to
at least, it's reported we're trying to protect students rights. If a
student can get membership into an organization and cannot serve as a
leader in the organization in my opinion that is discriminatory on it's
face. That's the first problem that I have with. In other words you can
come in, and we'll let you come in, you'll pay your dues, you'll do all
those things but you cannot be a elected as a leader. So I don't support
discrimination in any fashion and so to allow me as a student to come
into an organization and not be able to participate as a leader to be
elected. I think that's the first thing that we are doing wrong. But as
I talk to the universities in my district, basically they have indicated
that this bill is really not needed because if there is a problem on the
campus the board of governors or the board of trustees should really
deal with those matters but it's interesting to me that the university
board of governors that was appointed by this body had a policy that
they were getting ready to vote on today at least that's the
understanding that I had. They came through the comity on university
governance. Which basically would have provided, put a policy in place
and I wonder why that policy is not good enough.</p>

Speaker:?? Representative John about that policy,
Speaker Changes: Representative Johns the gentlemen you,
Speaker Changes: I did,
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen you yells,
Speaker Changes: Representative John i think you are probably with the
proposal for the new policy that the board of governors was considering
why is that policy would enough,
Speaker Changes: Thank you for your question Representative Adam son let
me just talk about saying that i have been working with this issue
alongside ?? for well over a year and i have a very different
understanding for you as far as the ?? and the administrators university
i cope with ?? consulted quite a bit and quite frankly after we passed
the ?? bill i quite quite content to move with the senate but he was
held up for some period of time well he was waiting with some of the
conversations i think ?? i think Representative stamp allowed to that we
don't have the same board of governors from year to year ,decade to
decade ,we don't have the same university of governors ?? and frankly i
would rather just clarify that our students do have the first mi mid
right in what they are law ?? university administrators all board of
governors,all board of trustees are who ever,Steve organization have
light to exist and this bill ?? what happened over-side making decisions
if such organization not exist on their campus for reasons of safety or
whatever and i understand your comment of earlier you aid that you wont
support discrimination in any fashion,i think any bod in this chamber
would say we don't support discrimination because ?? ethnic background
or bank account anything like that but i would suggests that in our
society that political committee gone a muck,there is a such thing in a
discrimination such that i think everybody in this chamber is married
when you choose discrimination from your spouse all around there,i m
well aware that there are group like democratic and republicans men
groups and women group and they have they have the specific criteria in
what they in groups i don't think that it's a improper discrimination ??
because they don't allow boys to join and so i think we seen to get away
from the political correctness that is gone a ?? and we have to
recognize that these students have mi mid right and it should not be
freed ed by university administrator or presidents or board of directors
or board of governors or board of trustees whoever to make that
determinations,
Speaker Changes: Thank you for your response i was thinking more about
the fact that those bodies the board of directors the board of governors
,board of trustees they set path actually the board of Governors said
policies we were  just been talking about this said last here and we
change every two years sometimes hopefully we don't have a complete wipe
out sometimes that is possible to,i wanted to as i was reading about the
while issue i came across Martinez are which speaks to all commerce if i
could direct the question too Representative Glacier
Speaker Changes: Representative Glacier  will you,
Speaker Changes: Yes Mr.Speaker,
Speaker Changes: He yells,
Speaker Changes: Representative Glacier are you familiar with the
Martinez case the meaning of the all comers and the whole resolution
that came from that case,

the case is refer to ?? university of California,Hastings college of law
Martinez,
Speaker Changes: Follow,
Speaker Changes: Gentlemen you,
Speaker Changes: I do yell,

<p id="050:00">
Was decided, was whether or not the university's all-comers policy,
which allowed there to be distinctions in leadership, but did not allow
there to be ?? made on the basis of status, with respect to memberships
and groups. Specifically, the question became whether the university's
policy passed first amendment muster, or was in some way discriminatory.
By making or providing that student groups had to accept membership from
all-comers, and not based on their status. The question in that case
came to the supreme court. The supreme court ruled 5-4, that the
university's policy, which required open membership in the
organizations, was constitutional, did not violate the student's first
amendment rights. Was consistent with California's equal educational
opportunity policies. And, made it clear that one of the things that the
university policy was trying to get at, was to prohibit, and prevent
student organizations from becoming, subterfuge if you will. For
different partisan political beliefs, for different, issues with regard
to organizations that the university thought that student money ought
not be spent all around, everywhere. If there were real limitations
being placed on who could be members of those organizations and that.
The university, as a university had a right, to want to ensure that all
students had access to student organizations. And, to membership in
those organizations. And, that if an organization chose because of the
status of someone to, decline membership in those organizations, that,
that didn't fulfill the mission of the University of California system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, thank you. Just to make one final comment,
ya know, I think that we are treading dangerous water. We have a board
of governors, I wish it were more diverse, really I do. But, it's not.
But it does have, we've given the board of governors the authority to,
to set policy like this. But greater than that, each university already
has, and I've talked with a number of them, they have it, and I think
we're treading in an area where we are looking at a violation between
separation of state and church. Where these organizations  now, the
university's, if this bill is passed, and maybe that's really the
intent. The university would have to support, financially these
organizations, and some of the discriminatory practices. And when you
don't allow someone, who is a member of the organization, to serve in
the capacity of leadership, then that's discrimination, and I think we
really need to be concerned about that. I think that this bill is very
problematic, it will be problematic for the universities, every
university that I've spoken to says that. They say that it's not needed,
and I don't know why, if we would elect members of the board of
governors, that we would, that we would, try to circumvent a policy that
we asked them to put in place, in the first place. I would certainly
encourage you to vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. To be recorded as voting aye on

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this bill,
and would urge members to support it. Just last week we spoke about
student's rights, and we've heard it on the floor today. That students
do have first amendment rights that they do not shed at the school house
gate. That applies at the K-12 level, it applies also at the college,
and university level. This is a policy decision that we want to make, it
supports the constitution that we want to support. Student's right's to
freely associate, to freely associate around religious beliefs, other
mission based beliefs, and so this is what this bill is about. I do want
to speak a moment to the Martinez case, as well. There were a few points
that were made about the holding in that case. But, what's very
important is that, the Martinez case is the very reason we need this
bill. The supreme court, in Christian Legal Society vs. Martinez said
that Hastings College of Law.</p>

That policy was okay that it was constitutional but it did not say that
schools were required to have such policies and so we as a governing
body, we are making the decision today if this bill passes and again I
would urge your support of it we are making the decision that it is not
okay for universities to engage in this kind of conduct.  We do want our
student organizations to be free to associate around such beliefs, such
religious beliefs, such mission-based beliefs and have the authority to
make those kinds of decisions.  So I would urge your support of this

take up more time on the floor and delay the amendment.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bill that
we heard last session, and there was a little bit of debate on sex
offenders and everything, but I just want to tell you what has changed.
When we sent it over to the Senate, it had an effective date of December
1, 2013. Of course, we didn't make that deadline so we needed to make a
amendment done to December 1, 2014, however once it got in to committee,
a few senators, Senator Randleman in specific, had a problem with
delaying it. She was concerned that if we made it effective December 1st
then that gave people 5-6 months to move to where they wanted to move
and then they would be grandfathered in and so she asked me would it be
OK to make it effective upon passage and I told her that was fine with
me, and I do move to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,

Would we want to rush this when we can wait till tomorrow when all the
members can have a chance overnight to read the bill, why would we now
wanna do that? This is a major environmental policy bill. It is a bill
that has bipartisan support. There are number of people on our side who
support the bill, there is no reason to push it, why would you want to
vote on a bill that you are not seeing until right now? And that
remembers us why we should vote against the motion to hear the bill.
Right now, we should hold off till tomorrow which we can easily do,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will bring people’s attention to your dashboard it’s on the dashboard
now, many of the parts of this bill are bills that either already passed
through here or already came through E or C and some committees so they
have been out for a while and filed for a while so they are available
for us to read as Representative Luke said it was bipartisan support I’m
willing to go through all of the parts and to make sure we all
understand it, we can put it off to another day but I don’t think it
will change the outcome and would recommend that we go ahead and do it
now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen I would ask you to vote
against the motion I don’t think we should consider this bill today I’m
gonna briefly tell you why and I have the same remarks I was gonna make
on the regulatory reform it was attempted to be added on. It’s 20 some
pages long and I don’t like to read it and I don’t like to understand it
and I’m gonna give you a real world example, if you look at the
regulatory reform bill of last year House Bill 74 there is an error in
it, it pretends at the bottom to say except it was otherwise provided
this act as effective when it becomes a law. However, there was a clause
that was mistakenly left in the bill about four Senates higher that
actually makes most of the regulatory reform bill July 1st, 2015 that’s
where I discovered when I finally got to the end of the bill well
everybody was doing stuff last year when we ask not to add it on, it was
like page 58 or 59, I would check with staff and they told me yes I was
right that was a mistake and it would mess up the intend of the bill but
we just rushed it through. I don’t know how of them vote on the bill and
had ___[02:41] but I would ask for the ___, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state as ___
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My procedural ignorance here, I know there are such things is three day
bill and I have not yet been able to learn exactly what they are for
qualify this, is this a bill that we could have second and third reading
both on tomorrow and vote on or is this one that has the stretch over
three days that might determine how they are doing this motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, this bill could be, we could take both readings without objection
tomorrow otherwise there will be a Friday session if there is objection
we take up second reading tomorrow or if we take it up on second reading
tomorrow if there is an objection the intern of the chair to have a
Friday session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I think you came up with a good idea in your
discussion with Representative Collins and that is if we do it on second
and third tomorrow I have the same concerns that Representative Jackson
has that not only we not had a chance to read the bill when I was in
finance and some other meetings regarding the bills that we didn’t get a
chance to review and I have a lot of constituents who want to read bills
and tell me from their expertise of personal experience how it affects
them so I would know how to respond to it or make amendments to it. So,
Mr. Speaker I would certainly on behalf of the Democratic Congress agree
to second and third on tomorrow, we would certainly want our
constituents to have an opportunity to read the bill and let us know
what they would wanna do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[04:30] as the Chair understand that if we carry this
over to tomorrow there will be not any objection to third reading and we
can’t dispose which one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s our intention yes Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then the Chair would ask Representative Moore to be recognized to
___[04:46] motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker based on that agreement for second and third we will throw
all the motion to add this particular bill…

Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe on the dashboard all of the bills
that represent or have been added without objection are now available on
the dashboard.  So we will move to the supplemental calendar. House Bill
1033. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1033. An act to
authorize Richmond County to impose a special assessment for repair of a
dam the general assembly of North Carolina acts. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen is recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is just a bill
which authorizes the county commissioners in Richmond county to create a
special tax district ??? dam all the property owners that are contingent
to the area are in favor there's no opposition, it's passed through
government and finance and now we ask for your support. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hastings, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Goodman does this gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman, the title references  an assessment and you
mentioned a special tax district, an assessment is not a tax, is that
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I've talked to bill drafting about that I
think those words can be used interchangeably in this case. Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hastings, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Stam will yield for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, does the gentlemen
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, is an assessment a tax? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The label is not determinative. A tax is for the general
support of the government, an assessment for something that improves the
property. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So to confess, I really wasn't paying a
whole of attention to the debate but it probably sounds to me like an
assessment  rather than a tax. But you do have to pay it whether you
like it or not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman, if the gentleman will yield for a moment. It's
the chair's understanding that this is a roll call bill so the reading
today was first reading and we cannot take it up until tomorrow anyway.
We've got 24 hours to put it in the crockpot Representative Hastings to
answer your question. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to move forward
to the public bills. The second page of the supplemental calendar to
give members an opportunity to look at all of the local bills that are
eligible for second and third reading voice vote and determine whether
or not the chambers amenable to voting those as a group. So if you will
please look at the middle of the first page of the supplemental calendar
local bills under second and third readings with one additional one on
the top of the second page I will come back and see if there's objection
to voting any of those as a group. And without objection we'll move
forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Michaux, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We're just getting
a copy of the supplemental calendar so can you give me about a minute or
two...[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, I'm gonna give you more than that.
What I was wanting to do is go ahead and move to the public calendar so
we'll dispose of the local bills either individually or as a group at
the end of the public calendar. House Bill 1088. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1088. An act to direct the state highway
patrol to the feasibility and cost effectiveness of contracting with
local businesses to perform maintenance on highway patrol vehicles en
lieu of requiring the vehicles to be taken to a regional maintenance
facility is recommended by the regional legislative committee on
judicial efficiency and effective administration of justice. The general
assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Davis, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, of the
house. This will require the Department of Public Safety to ?? the
feasibility and cost effectiveness of contracting with local businesses
to perform maintenance on State Highway Patrol vehicles in lieu of
requiring the vehicles to be taken to a regional maintenance facility.
The department shall report the results of the state to the joint
legislative oversight committee on justice and public safety by March
2015. A lot of times highway patrol stations are far away from their
maintenance facilities so they have to travel....</p>

long distance, which is time consuming and also expensive. It takes the
troopers away from their duties. What this would allow local highway
patrol stations to do would be to contract with local people to fix the
vehicles, thereby saving time and money and make it more efficient. And
I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville. The Chair's turned off your light a couple

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No problem. Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question
before the House is the passage of House Bill 1088 on it's second
reading. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open
the vote. All members please record. The clerk will let the machine
record the vote, 114 having voted in the affirmative, none in the

gentlemen, from this point until the end of session all messages will be

read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 1089, an act to direct the administrative office of the
courts to develop a case management system for civil cases in superior
court as recommended by the Legislative Research Commission's Committee
on Judicial Efficiency and Effective Administration of Justice. The
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill would direct AOC to study and develop
a case management system for civil cases in superior court designed to
make more efficient use of superior court time and resources including a
more flexible designation of mixed sessions. The study shall consider a
system allowing exception cases to be assigned to a superior court judge
to oversee the case. AOC shall report to the Joint Legislative Oversight
Committee on Justice and Public Safety by March 1, 2015. The mixed
sessions, as a lot of you all may know, when a superior court judge has
a criminal session for a week it may break down after a couple of days
and the judges go home. Well same thing with civil court. What this
would enable a criminal court judge to do during a criminal court
session, if the criminal court ends then that judge would have the
authority to contact civil lawyers and ask if there are any pretrial
motions or any other pretrial matters that might need to be heard to
keep things moving along. On the other side of the coin, if there was a
civil session and it broke down early this would allow the judge to
