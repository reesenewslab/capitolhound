We’re going to go through that bill first and if there’s any time for
the remaining bills we’ll try to get to those. If we do not get to those
this calendar will roll for tomorrow or next week. Representative
Dollar, sir are you handling senate bill 744? Well since I don’t see any
of your senate counterparts.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] We’re hearing just the finance fees of the..?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. ?? yes sir. As soon as Mr. Dollar gets to the
podium. Folks I believe on the top of your folders you will see a PCS
and that is the finance provisions. Representative Setzer moves we have
the PCS before us for the purpose of discussion. All in favor will say
aye. All opposed no. Representative Dollar you have the floor sir and if
you would like to have staff to go through the provisions we’ll be glad
to honor that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Averett.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Good morning. As Representative Howard said, the PCS
that you have before you this morning contains just the finance
provisions that are in the budget and I will briefly go through the tax
provisions and then Rodney has a chart and he will go through the fee
provisions. The first tax provision that is on is section 12h.18 of the
bill and this is something that has to do with an assessment for LME and
MCOs however this is not, it’s just directing that the assessment can be
allowed if the federal government allows it and all the details can be
worked out so this is a provision that had been in the senate bill and
as you will recall the federal government said that the way that it was
written and proposed by the governor could not be implemented in the
state at this time so this does not implement it but it does gives some
authorization in case it can be worked out and that authorization ends
July 1st, 2017. Section 15.2b increases the percentage rate used to
calculate the public utility regulatory fee. The regulatory fee was
actually set for both years of the biennium in last year’s budget but
this increases it and changes it for the year coming up from 0.13% to
0.14%. Section 20.2 of the bill increase the percentage rate to be used
for the insurance regulatory charge but it’s not for this biennium, it
is for the 2015 year and also in doing that it increase the purposes for
which that fee can be used. As you know the insurance regulatory charge
is used to reimburse the general fund for expenses that are incurred
from the department of insurance and there’s a list of purposes for
which it can be used to reimburse the general fund. This will add to it
the hearings that the industrial commission has and also in the bill
there’s a provision that would amend the fee setting authority for the
industrial commission to not authorize their fee setting ability for
these hearings. These hearings will in the future, not this year, but in
the future be paid from the insurance regulatory charge. Section 34.6 of
the bill is in your transportation part of the budget and it repeals the
quarterly refund of the motor fuel excise tax that’s paid by taxi cabs
and it delays the expansion of the highway use tax space to include the
dealer fees. That was something that was passed in last year’s budget
that the highway use tax would be not eh retail value of the car plus
the dealer fees but that was delayed and in this bill it is delayed
again. Section 36.12 authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds
from our two thirds bonds authority and Mark Bondo is here and can
explain that in some more detail in a few minutes. Section 37.1 moves us
to the end of the bill and the section of the bill that’s called the
finance changes. This section clarifies what is meant by the term net
general fund tax collected..</p>

<p id="05:00">
Last year the general assembly sat a trigger so that in the future the
corporate income tax rate may move down a percentage point if certain
triggers are met. It was unclear when you’re looking at that trigger,
there was a dollar amount set in the statute, where do you go to
determine if that dollar amount is met. It referred to the capital
report. However, that has many different charts. What is in your bill
now is what the appropriation committee and this body typically uses
when it puts together its general fund availability segment. When you
all are thinking what are our net general fund tax collections? The
information that Gary Boardman gives you and that you receive from your
budget development teams. This is the figure that is used. Section 37.2
phases out over four years the Medicaid home harmless provision. Some
years back, when there as a Medicaid swap when the state took over part
of the Medicaid expenditures, it held counties harmless, but in addition
to holding them harmless, it guaranteed every county at least a 500,000
dollar benefit. This begins to phase out that 500,000 addition that
every county receives. It is my understanding, when it is fully phased
out I believe there will be 24-26 counties that are continuing to
receive a whole harmless payment. Section 37.3 is a provision that you
all passed earlier in house bill 10-50, but the senate took it out. This
was a recommendation also of the revenue law study committee. It exempts
50% of the sales price of a manufactured or modular home from sales tax.
Lastly, Section 37.4 is a new provision, but it is a provision that
phases in the 7% sales tax rate on gross receipts derived from sales of
piped natural gas from one of eight gas cities over the next two years.
In the past the gas cities, of which there are eight, did not impose an
excise tax on the piped gas sold to their customers. The rate for those,
effective July 1st, was a going to be a rather large increase. This just
phases it in over two years.  The rate July 1st for the customers in
those cities will be 3.5%, and beginning July 1, 2015 it will be the
full 7% that all other customers of other piped natural gas companies
pay. Those were the tax provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Member of the committee. Do you have questions regarding the tax
provisions? Rodney Bissel?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam. Rodney Bissel with…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame chair? I’m sorry, was Mr. Bissel continuing with the explanation,
or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because, I had a question. I can wait.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You had a question on the tax provisions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the tax provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madame Chair. Rodney Bissel, with fiscal research. I’ll be
going over the fees spreadsheet that you have in your packet. This is
fiscal information and summary information on all the fees and the
finance PCS. You’ll see we have them grouped by team area beginning with
education. We have the section number of the bill, general fund or
special fund impact, and we also indicate whether this was in the senate
budget or not. Beginning with the education area in Section 11.9, we
have the UNC faculty tuition waiver. This increases the number of
classes that faculty or staff member at a UNC institution may take free
of tuition or fees from 2 to 3 and clarifies that the UNC system may
waive both tuition and fees for faculty. The next section, 11.18. UNC
set non-budget and tuition rates. This relates to a provision in last
year’s budget that decreased general fund appropriations by 27.3 million
to be offset by a non-resident tuition increase. Last year’s provision
also indicated the percentage increase of the non-resident tuition. This
provision is giving flexibility to the UNC system to set those rates as
it sees fit to meet the budget requirement of the 27.3 million. On the
next page, in the general government area, there is this one provision
that allows agencies to adopt emergency rules to enact fees or fee
increases without going through the normal rule process. Then in the JPS
area, beginning with Section 16b.3, the hazardous materials facilities
fee. This is a new fee for hazardous…</p>

<p id="10:00">
Hazardous materials for persons who are required under federal
requirements to report to the division of emergency management. The fee
is $50 for hazardous materials and $90 for extremely hazardous materials
and there was an amendment that passed in the JPS subcommittee that put
a $5000 cap on this fee. The ABC permit fee increases in section 16b.2
this is increasing the renewal and registration fee for ABC permits to
be equal to the initial permit fee amounts. This will increase the beer
and wine permit fees from $200 to $400 and mixed beverages will increase
from $750 to $1000. The private hospital toxicology fee is allowing a
court fee for toxicology tests at private hospitals allowing a fee for
that that would be the same as the fee for tests done at a local or
state crime lab. The community work crew fee is allowing the department
of public safety to charge a fee sufficient to cover its cost to provide
work crew services to local governments. Currently there’s a cap on that
fee of $150. Similarly the inmate labor contract in section 16c.3 allows
the department of public safety to charge transportation and
administrative fees to recover costs associated with inmate labor
contracts. On the next page under transportation, conversion of paper
titles just authorizes the conversion of existing titles from paper to
copies to electronic. Section 34.14 DOT signage fees is allowing the
department to recapture the cost to administer signs with logos for
private businesses and tourism oriented directional signs. Those current
fees are $300 and $200, this would just allow the department to set the
fees to recover costs. The next item 34.26 is fairy tolling. This
repeals the tolling authority of the board of transportation and it
removes tolls from three currently tolled routes and this would result
in a reduction of $2.1 million in the highway fund. In the HSS section
12e.3 this is an increase fee for private well water testing. The fee
would be increased from 55 to 74 and it would also add existing wells to
be tested as well as newly constructed wells. The innovations waiver
services is on here but Cindy addressed that under the tax provision so
I won’t repeat that here. The NER section beginning with the state fair
admission provision in section 13.2 this exempts the board of
agriculture from rule making for purposes of determining the state fair
admission cost. Forestry management plans implements a new fee for
forestry management plans and the cost depends on the acreages specified
here. The national poultry improvement plan fees is a fee increase for
the national poultry improvement plan certification for the initial
certification it’s $50 plus 10 cents per bird and for each subsequent
year the fee is $10 plus 10 cents per bird. On the final page commercial
fishing licenses, this is doubling six different commercial fishing
licenses over what the FY ’12-’13 amount was and you have listed here
for each license the ’12-’13 amount, the current amount, and then the
proposed fee amount. In section 14.13a this is the natural heritage
program online access fees that allows the DENR secretary to set fees to
offset the cost associated with preparing customized environmental
review services or developing online technology for external users to
access the natural heritage program data. It also provides for
conducting an inventory for natural areas, conservation and protection
planning. And finally the wildlife licensing changes provides a variety
of technical changes for the wildlife licensing fees and that concludes
the fee provisions. You can see the totals here are 12.2 million in the
general fund for..</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, questions with respect to the fees, before we
go back over to mark bondo with the bonding provision, Mr. Collins
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I actually had two questions on this, one is on the second page, the
hazardous materials, Just not being a part of any of these sub
committees I’m just wondering, who is that being, is that to manufacture
the hazardous materials, is it trucking companies that transport them, I
just kind of want to know who that fee is on and you also mentions the
maximum of 500 dollars, is that per truckload or per material being
processed, I just need a little bit more details about who that’s on and
what that 500 dollar limit means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Christine lagat, Christine if you would use your microphone please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair, Christine lagat fiscal research. The fee is going
to be charged on companies or industries that use or store hazardous
materials, for their business, it’s not trucking, and I’m sorry if you
could repeat the second part of your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The 500 dollar limit is that per week, per year, per certain poundage
or, would mention that this 50 dollars has a 500 dollar limit on it and
I was just wondering what that means more specifically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair, Christine lagat again fiscal research, its 50$ per
hazardous material that they use or store in their facility and 90$ per
extremely hazardous material it’s an annual fee and the cap is 5000
dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. brolly
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes madam chairman, inquire to the chair
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill has a ways to go after it leaves here, if there are fees added
to it after it leaves this committee, will they come back to this
committee for reconsideration, for consideration
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Collins
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just have one more question, this involves the national poultry
improvement plan certification, I just want to make sure I understand
this, because I have a lot of chicken and turkey farmers in my area,and
I am just wondering is this something they ??, I’m thinking these
chicken houses have like 10,000 birds you know in the plant at one time
and 10 cents per bird could be a big big fee, I like to know what this
fee is for and who it’s going to be imposed on before I vote for this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Dale, Timothy Dale sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, back here, timothy dale fiscal research?? Representative Collins, I
just, towards the back of the room over here, so this is primarily
targeted to your folks that have their small chicken production type
things, it’s not the big houses it’s a voluntary program, this is more
for branding for them so they can say they have quality products, it’s a
voluntary program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, further questions with respect to the fees.
Bondo sir are you ready, members we are going back to the bonding
provision which you will find on page 1 section 36.12
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mark Bondo, fiscal research, so 36.12 authorizes 263.7 million
dollars in 2/3s bonds which were a form of general obligation bonds,
allowed in the constitution, their formulated on a calculation of the
amount of general obligation debt repaid over the previous biennium.
What this prevision does is it allows the authorization of 15.4 million
dollars to construct the western crime lab in Edniville and it also
allows for the renovation of the able marrow building for 42.3 million
dollars. The next item is the 206 million dollar reauthorization of
existing authorized, but unissued debt, so the state has 206 million
dollars of authorized but unissued nonvoter approved debt, known as
special indebtedness for cops, that is attached to a project, what this
would do is reauthorize that debt as general obligation debt to achieve
a triple a rating instead of the double A+ rating that the other debt
has, which will allow for slight interest rate savings over time, but
also look better on the state’s overall balance sheet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. holme
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is not on the bond section, this is a different subject, are you
ready for other questions?</p>

<p id="20:00">
… if anybody has any questions on with respect to the bond issue. Mr.
Starnes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we get a comment from the Treasurer’s
Office on the debt affordability? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anyone in
the back of the room that would like to speak for the Treasurer’s
Office? Sam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, Sam Watts from the
Treasurer’s Office. If you have a… my person who would be the person to
answer the question is not here right now, so I would… I can get an
answer before your end of your meeting though. What’s the specific
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] How does this two thirds bond comport with
the debt affordability? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll get back to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mark. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mark ?? is helping to address that question, Mr. Starnes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir. In the 2014 debt affordability study that the Debt
Affordability Advisory Committee put out, the 206 million dollar
reauthorization was one of their recommendations. The other two items –
the 15.4 million dollars and the 42.3 million dollars of new debt
authorizations – would keep the state below the four percent
recommendation that they have, so the Debt Affordability Council
recommends for the state to stay no more than four percent below current
revenues, as that service would be calculated as a percentage of that.
This would keep them… the state would still be well below that level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Back to the general
questions now. Mr. Hall? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair, and
I’ve got some questions about the 106 million I believe we’re generating
from the increase in the advertizing for the lottery. So I wanted to
know what the basis was for the projected 106 million that we’re going
to get from that, and do we have - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Hall, that’s
actually not a part of this bill, and if you could hold that questions
until the full appropriations meeting that will follow shortly. That’s
not a part of this bill this morning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well could you
tell me who…? Is anyone on the staff here this morning going to be the
person that’s going to be able to provide that information when we get
there, so I can try to contact them before we…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a
minute. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll contact the lottery people and have them
get up ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Avery is going to contact the Lottery
Commission and have someone to be in that meeting for you, Mr. Hall.
Members of the committee, we’re going to take all your questions, and
then if you have an amendment, I need to have it up here so we can get
it back to our staff. If the amendment has an impact on this year’s
budget, then Mr. Dollar is going to indicate that it does affect the
availability and that amendment will be rules out of order. Members of
the committee, questions. Mr. Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam
Chair. I have a question for Ms. Avery on staff if that’s alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Going back to her
presentation, I’m just curious what the section 37.3, which exempts 50
percent of the sale price of manufacture of model module home from the
sales tax, could you give me an idea… do we have an idea what type of
dollar amount that would be estimated to be? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
If you will… on the fiscal note, it indicates that it would be 6.1
million for the fiscal year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further questions, comments or concerns. I have two amendments
up here. Are there others coming? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Luebke? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you be kind enough
to tell us what the topics are on the amendments? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, modifying the ?? credit, and Representative
Holley, restore earned income tax credit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have one more. Representative Samuelson, and
this is a credit for investing in renewable energy property.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Mr. Dollar, do you have any other comments that you would like to make,
with respect to the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No Madam Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Miss Holley, you’re recognized to send forth an amendment.
Members, the sergeant at arms will pass out the said amendment. Mr.
Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] An additional question, at the appropriate
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It might be now. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. My question is on page 26, the 37.1A, dealing with the
trigger for the corporate income tax cut. Just help me understand what
we’re clarifying here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, right
now the trigger would be set at the, if the net general fund tax
collections for the certain fiscal years meet the amount set in the
statute. The question is where do you go to look, to see what those net
general fund tax collections are, and what the current law says is the
state’s comprehensive annual financial report. Well my understanding is
that report is pages and pages long and has several different charts in
it, all that read a little differently depending upon where you’re
starting from. So what this does is to try to use for that trigger the
general fund, what the general assembly typically thinks of as the net
general fund tax collections. And what this body usually looks to is
what’s reported by the department of revenue in its reports. And so if
you’ll look on page 26 it says the net general fund tax collections will
be the net revenue amount reported by the department of revenue in its
June statement for the 12-month period and in the prior June 30th. And
then there are a couple of adjustments that Mary Boardman, working with
our budget development team, felt that you would want. And one is that
you would take from that any large one-time, non-recurring dollars. And
the second are any adjustments that would be made because of perhaps
budgetary decisions to end transfers or move transfers back and forth.
For instance, local government transfers right now aren’t part of that,
but if you somehow drew them into the general fund or something it might
artificially inflate it. So this would just be allowing those
adjustments so that you would receive a true picture of what your net
general fund tax collections were for those years. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
what would be an example of a large one-time monetary infusion? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You may have a case that’s settled. A large corporate income
tax case that settled and you might receive several hundred, you know,
several million dollars. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Holley, you’re
recognized to send forth your amendment and explain that amendment,
ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. This is an amendment
that’s dealing with restoring the earned income tax credit for the
corporate poor. The unincorporated poor. It’s based upon the rules where
we took the corporate taxes and then reduce them down from six to five
percent. What I’m asking is that it go down to 5.6% which is a 4/10 of a
percent difference, that will take care of both the unincorporated poor.
Now, the earned income tax credit, the people who normally get the
earned income tax credit are historically only on this tax credit for a
couple of years. And this is a real important thing for them because
where it stands now with the reduction in the earned income tax credit,
they are actually getting a tax increase. These are the working people
who have a tendency to be overlooked. So what we’re doing is, what I’m
asking is that you reduce it by 4/10 of a percent, what we were trying
to give the corporate, the corporations, and give it to the
unincorporated. To the poor people with the earned income tax credit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In opposition, the
rationale for the federal earned income tax credit is that the working
poor are paying FICA and Medicare tax which is significant but they
don’t pay that at the state level. There’s nothing that they’re
offsetting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Leubke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just
say a few words in support of the amendment Representative</p>

Holly has pointed out that this helps working people, and actually its
actually it’s beyond the poor. It’s not just along the working poor,
according to our fiscal research staff 22% of all tax filers are
eligible for this earned income tax credit and this helped people around
the state, many of you republican or democrat have many constituents,
who are beneficiaries of the earned income tax credit, they were and
will continue to be if the amendment is supported, and that amount, that
22% of north Carolinians who benefit from the earned income tax credit,
is a million filers, so that’s a million filers across the state, it is
only fair that we provide them with some opportunities to have more in
their pockets so that they can drop it from their pockets to the retail
merchants around them, but most importantly it’s a fairness issue given
how many people need this income, 22% again of all tax filers and I
support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thankyou madam chair, may I speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mam, I want to thank the lady from lake for bringing this
forward, I would like to take the time to remind the committee and to
remind the public that may be listening, that in last year’s effort to
help working families this general assembly greatly increased the
standard deduction that all tax payers are able to get, we expanded the
child tax credit for the lower income working families that we have, and
we also cut the sells tax on good that working families need to buy,
including diapers, clothes, school supplies and whatnot, we are very
Intune and very aware of the struggles that our working families face,
and we have tried to address those in a broad approach way, a way that
helps them get the training they need to get the jobs that they need, to
support themselves and support their families, this is not a good
amendment, this does not go in the direction of empowering people and I
would urge that community to vote it down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? Miss holly your recognized ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I think this does go in the direction of empowering people,
because it is the working people that its effecting there are a lot of
people now that are having to take less of the income in lower paying
jobs, this is a little bit of a safety net, we’re not talking a lot of
money here, this is a little bit of a safety net, this is one flat tire
for us away, some people are one flat tire away from poverty, and this
is a little bit of a safety net and there is not enough that we can do,
half of these people are children, these are families, have this effect
3 million people a year in north Carolina and 300000 people a year in
north Carolina and half of them are children, thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Holly has moved for the adoption of the amendment, Mr. hall
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the amendment madam chair, thank you madam chairman and I’d
appreciate the comments of representative lewis in reference to last
year’s tax bill, and I think, despite the best intentions possibly of
the majority last year, we did have a bill that was passed that provides
continuing and escalating tax decreases for parts of our community, but
at the same time it might have been overlooked that we increased the
taxes on 80,000 small businesses in the state, by doing this one revenue
neutral earned income tax credit, we will put more money back into the
economy as representative holly said, it will also allow more families
to have the opportunity to withstand emergencies which would, in all
instances put them on social services assistance, or department of
health and human services assistance, so this is something that will
help, not only the families, it will be a little bit less of a tax cut
for others, but it will restore people to where they were before they
got a tax increase, those million north Carolinians, so to have this
money back in the economy it will be circl</p>

It will help those small businesses, those 80 thousand small businesses
that got that tax increase, and it’s a good thing for North Carolina,
it’s a good thing for the small communities where these businesses are,
and we’ve continually pounded our small and rural areas, and this would
be an assistance to them as well as those 80 thousand small businesses,
so I’d ask for you to support this. This helps our small business as
well as our families who are struggling. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to clarify a couple things, I’m one of those 80
thousand small businesses. You are too if you’re self-employed. If you
remember back in 2012, this General Assembly under our leadership gave a
two-year basically hiatus on paying taxes on the first 50 thousand
dollars you make by self-employment income to try to spur the economy.
Apparently it’s worked from all the DOL figures we see. Regardless of
whether it’s U4, U5, U6; whatever number you look at – unemployed,
underemployed, ??, aggregate, rate – we’re growing our economy faster
than almost any other state, and faster than any other state that hasn’t
already gone into energy exploration over the last two years. I
understood that that was going to be temporary and that I wasn’t going
to have my income taxes lowered by three thousand dollars a year every
year for the rest of my life and that I’d get back to paying the normal
North Carolina income tax after a couple of years. I think most
self-employed people understood that. As far as the other incident goes,
if I remember our debates right last year, the state earned income tax
credit maxes at 80 dollars. There’s no way in the world that the dropped
sales taxes and the increased standards of production and the other
things that representative Lewis mentioned don’t more than make up for
that 80 dollars, so for me this is much ado about nothing and I would
ask you not to support the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re getting

Motion fails on a vote of 23, 13. Representative Samuelson, ma’am,
you’re recognized to send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Madam Chair. ?? Thank you. They’re passing out the amendment. This
has to do with the renewable energy tax credit that is due to expire on
January 1, 2016. This does not change that. What it does is simply
acknowledge that projects sometimes take longer than you expect to get
them finished, and so what this is recognizing is that if a project is
under construction and meets sort of the federal guidelines for what
constitutes under construction, that as long as it is put in service by
July 2017, that it would still qualify for the credit. There are not
going to be a lot of these. I understand from staff there would be no
fiscal impact in this year and minimal fiscal impact going forward, but
it just recognizes that as the economy has turned around, it has gotten
harder to gauge exactly how long it takes to complete a construction
project. Any of ya’ll who have ever built anything know that it’s really
hard to guess, and so the way the language was originally written, it
said that it had to be completed by a certain date. Well sometimes you
can do all your best as a contractor and you just can’t get it finished
by a certain date, and if you’re trying to get investors in your project
and you know there’s got this hard completion date that nobody can
really control, it gets harder to do the projects, and I believe… I
talked to Representative Hager and I believe he’s the one that I thought
might oppose it, and if Mike wants to respond to it, I think that he
said he was okay with this as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the
committee… Mr. Starnes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does staff have an estimate on
the fiscal cost? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Jonathan? Jonathan Tart, do you have
an estimate of the fiscal impact? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We do not have an
estimate of the fiscal impact at this time other than because of the
date on it, it should for you. I don’t have that right at hand. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ms. Carney? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I think
this is a good amendment. I think it shows us being proactive as we are
moving forward with our growth in this state, and I do think it’s going
to pick up a lot of these smaller businesses that are looking to expand
in this area, so I would ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On the
amendment, Mr. Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I have
an inquiry for maybe the amendment sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
Ms. Samuelson, so you…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Representative. I appreciate the amendment. Your argument was
contractors are just not able to quite finish the project, so my
question is why would you have only 5 percent starting? That’s just a
very beginning before the deadline. Why not like 50 percent? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Good question, and I asked the question as well. That’s the
standard that the feds use under these similar programs, and it does
constitute a substantial investment on the part of the contractor, and
there’s a certain point early in the contract where you’re got to get
some okays that can be a delay. I’ve seen it before where you get the
foundation laid and then you hit this delay on part of it and you can’t
move forward, so it’s also recognizing where these delays often happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, on the amendment. Mr. Hager
and Mr. Dollar, I see you two. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam
Chairman. I just happened to be working; I had to go. Representative
Samuelson, I’ve talked about this. I think it’s fair for those that are
in process to a certain point to be able to take advantage of it, so I
think it’s a fair amendment and I’m planning on supporting it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Madam Chair, I think he is channeling me this morning. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ms. Samuelson moves the adoption of the amendment. All in favor
will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no.
The motion passes. Representative Davis sir, we’re going to stop for one
second. I’d like to have a motion on the minutes from our last meeting.
Representative Brawley moves that the minutes be approved. All in favor
will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, no. Representative Davis…</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma’am. I appreciate the Chair allowing the amendment to be
heard.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We need it. All members have copies of the Davis amendment?
Representative Davis, sir, you’re recognized to explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chairman. As you’re aware, the state of North Carolina
presently has a film incentive program that is scheduled to expire at
the end of this year. In looking at the extending this program, and
considering the tight proposed budget we are facing, and in the spirit
of compromise, I offer this amendment containing proposed changes to the
existing film incentive programs. There are four major things that this
bill does. Number one, it moves a sensate date to January, 2017, which
is a period of two years. It reduces the per project cap from 20 million
to 15 million dollars, which is a 25% reduction. It reduces the tax
credit from 25% to 22.5%, which is a 10% reduction. And it calls for an
independent study by the program evaluation division as to the state and
local tax revenue impacts.
The study by the Motion Picture Group that everyone has seen shows that
the incentives make money. The review by the legislative staff that
everybody has seen shows that the incentives cost the state. So, why not
allow this independent study, and I emphasize independent study, to take
place during that two year extension so that we can truly see what those
impacts are. The 22.5% reduction is the least amount that will keep
North Carolina as a tier one location. Because, if you are not a tier
one, then you might as well have no incentives at all because no one’s
going to consider coming here. These reductions will address the stated
desire to attract more TV shows with more permanent crew base capital
investment and permanent employment base without totally walking away
from movie production. This reduction in the credit will likely mean we
will not see anymore blockbuster films made in North Caroline. But we
can ensure the longevity of our film/television industry.
I had Patrick McHue, who was nice enough to do a projection that you
have concerning what the impact that such a reduction would have. The
only historical data that we could base it on is 2011, 2012, and 2013
and, as you can see, if this amendment had been in effect back then, the
state would have saved 3.2 million in 2011, 11.4 million in 2012, and
6.3 million in 2013. Because of the speculative nature of this industry,
it is very difficult to try to put together something that would show
the cost as to the future.
This amendment is critical to economic development in North Carolina
through a good, clean, nonpolluting business. This amendment is critical
to the people who work in the film industry in Wilmington and the
surrounding counties, to Charlotte and the surrounding counties, and to
those who work in the film industry throughout the remainder of North
Carolina. Time and time again I see bill after bill being argued in the
House because it will result in jobs, and I have supported them. Well,
the film industry allows 4200 people to have full-time jobs with an
average pay of $60,000. That doesn't even include the part-time jobs.
That does not even include</p>

<p id="50:00">
All the businesses that supply the film industry, whereby they can
provide additional jobs for their employees. The bottom line, members of
the Committee, is that the Senate budget does not contain any provision
for the film incentives. Unless the House amends the Senate budget, the
film incentives are dead, and the film industry is gone from North
Carolina. Most will leave, or they’ll stay, and be on unemployment and
Medicaid and try to find other jobs where they have those specialized
skills which the movie people have. There’s no reason for us to beat
ourselves up over this in the Committee or the House floor. All we need
to do is to agree on a film incentive proposal that we can send back to
the Senate. They will probably not agree, and this issue will be sent to
Conference to be vetted and decided upon. Therefore, I ask you to please
vote for this amendment, so we can get the process going, so we can get
this issue in conference with the Senate. Then we will have an
opportunity to either approve or not approve the Conference report. I
contend to you, most respectfully, that this is the right path for us to
take at this time, rather than to liquidate the film industry. Thank
you, and I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair. Point of order? Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Stam
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under the rules you announced at about 9:00, I don’t
see an offsetting of, anything to offset the amount, and I’m wondering
if that violates the rules you announced at the beginning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m trying to make that determination right now, Mr.
Stam, We’re not sure of the impact of the amendment on this year’s
budget. Mr. Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chair. I’ve a question, I’m not sure
if the sponsor or staff would need to answer this. Is this a refundable
tax credit or a non-refundable tax credit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry. This will remain what is in place as far as
that. In other words, it will still be based upon the amount that they
spend and then they will be refunded 22.5% rather than the current 25%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, as a follow up, just to confirm, a company that
paid no taxes in North Carolina would still be eligible for a full
refund of the amount in the tax credit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Davis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. Thank you, Madame Chairman. Representative
Brawley, as you are aware, the tax credit is really not a tax credit. It
is a refund written back to the industry based upon currently 25% of the
qualifying expenditures that they make. And that would remain in effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Collins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I had a question. I think they’re getting to my point.
I keep seeing, if I could take this as it’s written, and believe what it
says, I might be able to vote for it. But I keep seeing the word
taxpayer. In line 7, I see the word taxpayer. In line 12, I see the word
taxpayer, and in line 29, I see the word taxpayer, and I haven’t even
read the backside yet.  But I had three of the executives from these
committees come to my office last year, and I was trying, I was talking
to them about the fact we weren’t doing this in a vacuum. We were
decreasing corporate tax rates. They made it very clear to me that they
don’t pay any taxes in North Carolina. So I don’t know how we’re getting
by giving the money, if our, apparently our current statutes say
taxpayer all over the place, and these people aren’t paying any taxes in
North Carolina, unless they told me something that wasn’t true last
year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Hamilton?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chairman. To that point, I think if
you look back at the Samuelson Amendment related to renewable energy,
you see the word taxpayer repeated over and over again as well. The fact
is, is that the expenditures in this state from the film industry
exceeded over a billion dollars in the last twelve years. They’ve paid
sales tax revenues to the state of North Carolina. They’re only
receiving a quarter of that money back, 25% of their total North
Carolina qualifying expenditures, which includes a significant amount of
sales taxes, as well as state income taxes paid by thousands and
thousands of workers who receive paychecks from these production
companies. This is a net gain to the state of North Carolina.
Expenditures must take place first. I think that Mr. Davis’s amendment
is a very fair amendment. It reduces the obligation of the state. It
also targets the industry more toward television production, which are
longer term jobs in the state of North Carolina with long term contracts
when series are picked up. It takes us more away from the film industry,
and more toward television, which again are longer term jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Hager?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chairwomen. I don’t think anybody.</p>

Stand on the tax credit now see from the far, this tax credit thinks
like out front orange casing system let me tell you why, if you look at
the paper ?? about what the difference between the 15B and ?? you look
the money we spend in the last three years, look the money we gonna
spend for moving forward. As each one you stand and say education is the
most important thing in North Carolina, is this money better who spend
on teacher's assistants and teachers and schools ?? that's a question
you have to ask to yourself. In a limited budget of money are we gonna
spend it on ?? what we think as most important thing what I think is the
most important thing is education. So you guys have to make a decision
today and I will vote and I vote no because I want to spend this money
in education, on teacher’s assistant back in the classroom and I wanna
pay teachers a little more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you ma'am chairman. I wanna speak in favor of the
amendment, in my district we have the production go on now for bed
sheets and but one production during the life of the ?? is gonna kick in
about 5 or 6 million dollars per month into the local economy that's add
up to about 30 million dollars. That one production employees 300 people
most of whom are full time, all of whom live either in the shallot area
or the surrounding countess I know that several folks live low in ??
because I met them and talk about their commune. The people who are
employed are not just folk who live in my district but they live in the
area in near for the economic activity spread out. I also know in order
to get credit on this one production they are spending in north Carolina
and they keep copies and records of that spending so their pay and sells
tax form in getting a repay on the back in. It makes sense if all it
about is jobs, we have good clean nonpolluting jobs coming out of the
industry. If what we are concerned about is ongoing employment this
measure will help develop and keep our television industry in North
Carolina. It makes sense it aliens with everything the folk on both
sides of ?? and I urge thou to vote for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If your turn one quick follow up please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much madam chairman I will be brave.
Just as an example set in North Carolina right a multimillion dollar
cheque every year to USA raise for their jet fuel tax sales tax repay
they are only obligated to pay two and half million dollars in jet fuel
taxes to the state of North Carolina and at the end of the year whatever
they spend in access of that is paid out to them in the cheque. I just
want you ask to consider that on the outside of the North Carolina
corporation we talking about 4200 workers on the state of north Carolina
that are already here, these are clean jobs they are already here and
it's about families in north Carolina that are paying income taxes and
supporting the state. I would like to call for the aye's and no's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Miss Sanderson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Think you have a question for bill sponsor may be ?? I
was looking for a bill that actually, I mean the name of the sponsor, I
was looking for a bill that actually changes the structure of which this
does not, is there another proposal anywhere floating around here that
actually changes the structure of how we do this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative ?? respond mam chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes air quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you mam. Representative ?? the only thing I know
out there is a snit legislation that's in the P3 legislation that calls
for the grand program which is my will just kill the?? Because ?? last
year. And I am not sure whether that's going anywhere or not.

they got some tax credits look at all the ancillary businesses they've
generated I think if you look at the film industry instead of just
talking about this credit and the film industry that you look at all
ancillary businesses that go along with it we need to pass this
amendment.
Is there anybody that don't wanna speak, have a...Rodney Rodney Moore
we'll get back to miss Carney and I have right now I have Tim Moore and
Rodney Moore and miss Carney is there anybody else I'm gonna cut it off
right there Rodney Moore.
Thank you madam chairman I'll be very brief the film industry in North
Carolina started in my hometown in Wilmington around 1980 I guess was
the production of King Kong the De Laurentiis and with the advent of
that industry especially in the city of Wilmington it created not only
direct jobs for people that work with the crew it also helped ancillary
businesses like representative Brawley said with laws and all of that
and if you say if this film industry goes [??] it's gonna be a major
impact on employment in North Carolina it's not only Wilmington or
Charlotte they're doing shoots and sights all over the state and so we
really if we're really about jobs if you really still have your red your
little red band and you snap your wrists every time you get of a message
to talk about anything other than jobs then you really need to consider
this amendment and you need to support this and help us come up with a
valuable solution to this issue because this is a multi million dollars
business in the state and it's not only the forty two hundred jobs but
it's all the ancillary jobs in other industries that support the direct
film industry so if you're about jobs let's find a solution to this
issue let's pass this amendment and let's negotiate and move forward
thank you.
Miss Carney.
Thank you madam chair and thank you for your indulgence today as you can
tell there's a lot of passion about this issue and as I've said recently
and will keep saying we need to keep talking and what you can do today
in here by voting yes for this amendment as representative Samuelson was
just saying that there's something else out there, we're at the end of
the road with the budget we all know that but here's an opportunity for
us to keep the door wide open if you vote for this then we will be in
conference between us and the senate the senate has offered a dead end
with a grand proposal it doesn't give any commitment to the industry
with this we are saying as we said to our renewable energy people if
your project under weight we're gonna keep you alive in North Carolina
while a lot of these industries these film companies are already under
weight they can pull up and leave we don't want them to you don't it's
jobs let's keep talking vote this amendment up and let it go to
conference and let North Carolina come out with some commitment to an
industry that has grown over the years is continuing to grow and will
grow we all know it so let's keep talking let's keep it alive vote for
it and let's do conference with the senate.
Madam chair,
um Mr Hager and then Tim Moore.
Thank you madam chair just I did a quick back the envelope calculation
we spent 61.2 million dollars last year 40 thousand dollars a year that
would have put us back one thousand five hundred and thirty teaching
jobs.
Thank you Mr Moore do you have an amendment sir.
I do and it's so short it may not even need to be in writing if I can
just explain it line 7 credit [??] you read a tax payer that after the
word that put the words pays state taxes.
Madam chair madam chair.
Mr Stam .
Of course that doesn't I oppose the amendment that doesn't fix the
problem they could pay two dollars and stay in context and then be
qualified for 20 million.
