[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could, a moment of personal privilege out of
order.  Before the chancellor leaves to get back to his more pressing
duties, I would just like to indicate for the members-- I dont know if
you've seen the details of what our President just spoke about, but NC
State was recognized as the number one land-grant institution in the
nation for the granting of STEM degrees, and what that translates into
is jobs for the graduates of NC State.  We've got a lot to be proud of
with our university system and with our universities.  This is just
another shining example of the good work that's going on at NC State and
to go along with the other good work that's going on in our
universities.  So Chancellor Woodson, we appreciate everything that you
and your staff and your students do every day for North Carolina and for
NC State.

[Speaker changes.] Point of personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Senator, you have the floor for a point of personal
privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Members, officials with San Francisco Bay's Lumosity,
a website that turns memory exercises into online games, have used
information they've gathered to rank the nation's top 100 cities in
terms of intelligence of inhabitants. According to Lumosity, the website
has amassed the world's largest data set of human cognitive performance
with data and insights collected from more than 40 million people. The
study used data from more than three million people in the United States
between the ages of 18 and 75 who have played Lumosity brain training
games. The games measure performance across five cognitive areas:
memory, processing speed, flexibility, attention and problem-solving.
Gives me great pleasure today to let you know that the city of
Burlington, North Carolina is the 52nd ranked smartest city in the
United States of America. Also, I'd like to let you know Senator Soucek,
that Boone also made the top 100. No other city in North Carolina made
the top 100 in the smartest cities in the country.  Thank you.
(Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Mister President? I'd like to answer that.  I have
sought council and they have asked me to plead the fifth. (Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Sanderson, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Point of personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Sanderson, you have the floor for a point of
personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President.  I'd like to just take a
minute to thank all the members and all the staff for the acceptance and
the kindness that they've shown this week to my grandson, Caleb. He's
had a marvelous time and he will have many, many tales to take back to
his school next year and share with his fellow students so I just wanna
thank you.   (Applause.)
[Speaker changes.] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Moment of personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Apodaca has the floor for a point of personal
privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President.  Members, one of my
pages this week is the North Carolina State's singles high school
champion in tennis. I think 1A/2A...Jacob Fuqua???, standing there with
the bow tie, blushing. He uh..Senator Graham challenged him to a match
but Jacob had to spot him too many sets so we had to postpone that but I
just...we're all proud of Jacob for what he's done. Thanks.
[Speaker changes.] Congratulations, Jacob. (Applause.)
[Speaker changes.] Any further business come before the Senate?  If not,
Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
