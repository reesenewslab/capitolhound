...Prohibition on the Carrying Concealed Firearms for Certain Department
of Public Safety Employees. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Stanley, Representative Burr is
recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We had had a good vote on
this bill on Thursday and I won't go back through all the points of the
bill but there are a number of provisions in the bill. Obviously, many
of them have an impact on the every day lives of state employees, of
folks in district attorney offices, the corrections division and others,
and obviously the transfer of the SBI is included, as well. In an effort
to, we know that's not in controversy in the House and Senate budgets.
It's going to eventually happen there as we pass a budget, but in an
effort to go ahead and put this to rest and allow those, that transfer
to happen it's included here and obviously also includes the
authorization for the SBI to establish the additional positions for the
computer crime unit and allowing them to target folks online who are
targeting minors. And also includes the provisions of the request of the
Department of Justice to make sure they're able to keep five positions
that they still had listed under the SBI that should have been under the
crime lab.
But as I said, there's a number of good provisions in here. I think
there are a few amendments and we'll be happy to respond to those as
they come up. So, we'd appreciate your support again on this bill today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Jackson, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Member is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment ALH-102V3. Representative Jackson moves to
amend the bill on page 1, lines 3 and 4, by rewriting those lines to
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson, has
the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
assembly, I wasn't here when the Carrying Concealed Weapon Law was
originally passed, but a provision was put in to allow district and
superior court judges to carry their weapon onto the courthouse
property. They couldn't take it in the courtroom, but they could have
course have it on their person walking to and from their car. For some
reason, the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court was left out of that
ability to do that. I have a former law partner who is now a Justice on
the Court of Appeals. She brought this to my attention and asked that
this body consider that.
In particular, her concern was security. It was either this past year or
this coming year they had lost their security guard up front, so they
weren't even having a security guard on the premises. There was no metal
detector and all those things to walk through. So she would like to be
able to carry a weapon if she so chooses. I'd ask for the body's
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion...is this on the amendment?
Representative Collins, the gentleman from Nash, is recognized to debate
the...for what purpose does the gentleman rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the gentleman who sponsored the amendment
would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Nash?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson, I honestly just want to know
what I'm voting for. It's just like you ask questions this way,
sometimes, which I respect. The only effect of this amendment will be to
broaden which of our judges can carry concealed weapons. Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Randolph,
Representative McNeill, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question the amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Randolph?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I assume you've researched this or had staff research
that appellate judges are not already covered under the law that
currently exists?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that's correct, Representative. I didn't ask them
to research it. I researched it myself several months ago when the judge
brought it to my attention. I know that she's had discussions with other
people in the Chamber about possibly running this and then when I saw
this bill that had a carry and conceal piece on it, I thought it
appropriate to try and put it in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston,
Representative Bumgardner, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Can I ask the amendment
sponsor a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Gaston?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On page 2 of your amendment, section 1.3A, is that
language identical to what's in the bill? You see under here where it
says, &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to possess, carry,
whether openly or concealed, any deadly weapon not used for
instructional...&quot; blah, blah, blah. Is that already in the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, Representative. It's already in statute. My
amendment would just change the words district court judges or superior
court judge to just include justice or judge of the North Carolina...</p>

…Court of Justice just to make it apply the same rights to every judge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, ladies and gentlemen do you wish to ask him any additional
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to make an additional comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I compare the two because I’m looking at my iPad and when the
amendment comes up the bill goes away. So, that’s why I was asking,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Stanley, Representative Berg
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See for Representative Jackson I have one question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yell to the gentleman from Stanley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Jackson, in your amendment you are changing the
title of the bill which is not allowed for further reading to happen
unless the body wouldn’t object him but allow for that to take place.
So, would you have a proof this amendment passes or you may able to
allow in third reading to move forward deny and not objecting or
opposing third reading if we would pass this amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely, Representative Berg this is not a delay tag of anything I
know the same judge has talked to and speak more. So, I have no
objection to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Yancey, Representative Presnell
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to ask Representative Jackson a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yell to the lady from the Yancey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, this has in there too, increase the penalty for Concealed Carry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is just a continuation of the title of the current bill this before
us. I believe there will be an amendment dined to change that but
currently the bill that passed on Thursday carries an increase penalty
and that’s just copy in the title word-for-word. And my amendment makes
no change to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Lee, Representative Stone
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if gentleman would yell for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yell to the gentleman from Lee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I just wanna to make sure that I hear you
correctly and understand correctly all of this amendment allows is all
judges and off course can carry a concealed weapon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir, to my knowledge this is gonna add 22 judges that sit on our
court of appeal and Supreme Court to allow them to just to carry
concealed weapon in the courthouse not in the courtroom, just in the
courthouse should they choose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Lee has the floor to debate the bill, to debate the
amendment, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen I support this amendment, I
don’t go to court often but every time I do go in a court to do some
sort of business I sit back in the back rows and some part of the room
and I think, “Wow, this is unreal.” I wanna go and when I go in a
courtroom and sit on the back rows so that will support the judges and
in the courtroom and I hope you will vote for this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover, Representative Davis
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and Gentlemen, the house in view of Representative Jackson’s
statement that he will not insist on the third reading and allow this to
go forward tonight, I will ask you to vote for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate? If not, the question before the house
is the passage of amendment 5 send forward by Representative Jackson.
So, many favoring passage of the amendment will vote aye, those oppose
will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the
machine and record the vote. 110 having voted in the affirmative and six
in the negative the amendment is adopted. The gentleman from Wake,

The clerk will read the amendment.

This is amendment ALU-40 B2 Representative Stein moves amend the bill on
page 29 and 46 by inserting the line after the period and before the
quotation marks the following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is semi-technical and this comes from the AOC and the State Crime
Lab, we didn’t actually appropriate any money for remote testimony for
forensic testimony. So, this just makes clear that they don’t have to do
it till they get the money from somewhere.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate? If not, the question before the house
is the passage of amendment 6 send forward by Representative Stein. So,
me favoring passage of the amendment will vote aye, those oppose will

... having voted in the affirmative and one in the negative, the
amendment is adopted. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Rutherford, Representative Hager rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I must have my ADD on steroids today. I want to
be recorded as voting yes on the Jackson amendment please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The Chair thought you were just following Representative
Cleveland’s advice up there, since I wasn’t there for him to harass this
evening. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, let the records show that Joe
Nolan was bothering me at the time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The record will so
note. The gentleman’s vote will be changed to yes. Further amendments?
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth an amendment, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is Amendment AMD-84, V1.
Representative Jackson moves to amend the bill on page 25, line 40 by
deleting… [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake has the floor to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is
the amendment that most of you probably thought I was standing up to
introduce the last time. This one deals with the SPI. I listened to
Representative Blust on Thursday when he talked about how political it
was that it’s the same way he used to speak six years ago, five years
ago when the Democrats were in charge. Representative Blust used to sit
back there and stand up and make those arguments, and he’d move to set
aside the rules to the end, and I’d vote with him, and Representative
Owens would get up from his chair up here and walk back in the back and
say “Freshman, what are you doing voting with that man?” Used to happen
all the time, so I tried to think of a way to make this transfer not
political. I think there are good arguments on both sides. Whether it’s
in the AG’s office or under the Department of Public Safety, it’s going
to be political, but I remembered reading an article from Rob
Christensen a few weeks ago in the News &amp; Observer – some of you
might have seen it – and it recounted the story of when Senator Hagan
was first elected and President Obama was elected in 2008. One of the
first things that are usually done when the presidency changes is the US
Attorneys are all let go and new appointments are made. At Senator
Hagan’s request, President Obama held off for a while on that, and she
actually submitted what’s called a blue slip. We don’t have that ability
here, but she submitted a blue slip so that the US Attorney couldn’t be
changed until the investigation of John Edwards had come to an end. It
actually took about two and a half years. I think it was June of 2011
when he was finally indicted, and once he was indicted, she removed the
blue slip and the US Attorney was changed. I tried to think of a way to
do that for this case as well as far as the ongoing political corruption
cases. I could not think of a good way to have a certification or have
some, so what I did was I delayed the transfer until December 1st to
give them five months to finish their current active investigations.
It’s my opinion that moving a department of this size probably will take
a little time anyway. It will give them some planning time to get it up
and running, to get the new person selected who’s going to be in charge,
and I think it’s the nonpolitical solution to this issue that we find
ourselves in, so I’d ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Stanly, Representative Burr rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I rise to oppose the amendment. I think little really
will change by changing the effective date. Currently, if any of you
have… for those of you who went out a few weeks ago to the Highway
Patrol training area, you’d notice that the SPI’s office is located out
there with the Highway Patrol now. It’s not as if you’re going to be
packing up and moving these agents and this bureau from the Department
of Justice over to Department of Public Safety. It won’t involve a
transition like that, so the mindset that you’ve got to give them time
to put their stuff in a U-Haul and move is not really a valid argument
at this point, so I would ask that you oppose this amendment, and if the
transition’s going to happen, it’s best that it happen in a timely
manner. Allow for that to happen. Investigations will continue to
happen. None of that will change. Those will continue to go on day to
day as they do now, and I would ask that you oppose this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover,
Representative Davis rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the

For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford representative Blust.
See if representative Jackson will yield for a question.
does the gentleman from wake yield to the gentleman from Guilford.
Yes sir go ahead [??].
he is.
representative Jackson I listened with interest the other day as
representative Queen brought up this investigation how do you have any
assurance there is such an investigation I've never really heard it
verified and I'm wondering because the person in the center of it got
caught for something I think out in Utah and every one who had gotten
cash or contributions from him has disgorged theirs contributions very
quickly and I'm just thinking there was never a quid for the pro quo
because if there was going to be anything there it was interrupted what
is this investigation how much do you know about it I'm just not sure
what you're talking about or what some of the people you side have
talked on about.
thank you representative Blust I wanna be extra just very clear for the
record I have no inside knowledge of any pending investigations with the
SPI I base my comments on potential investigations that may be going on
at this time I've read the same things you've read in the paper but I
have no inside information of any investigations.

between lines 9 and 10 by inserting the following.
the gentleman from New Hanover has the floor to debate the amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker ladies and gentlemen of the house this is a
technical correction amendment there are four items the first item the
language in [??] is being moved from section 1.3 to section 1.1 where it
should have been to begin with as a result of moving that in paragraph
nine [??] we are inserting a North Carolina administrative law judge
which specifies as the other items in that particular part of the
statute what we're dealing with the third item is on page 3 line 43
we're simply deleting the number 3.4 and substituting the number 3.3
that is because the former 3.3 was removed in the appropriations
committee so that's just a number change and the last number four change
is changing section to part because actually what you're referring to in
that language is all of part 11 which includes sections 11.1, 11.2 and
11.3 I'll ask your support for this technical correction amendment.

… to amend the bill on page 2, lines 11through 17, by deleting the lines
and substituting the following. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from
Cabarrus has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. There’s a concern with the bill as it is presented to
us that persons who might unknowingly violate the statute would be
subject to a felony charge instead of a misdemeanor charge. For example,
say Grandma ?? breaks down and she borrows her grandson’s car. Maybe
she’s not aware that he’s a gang member, not aware that there’s a pistol
in the glove compartment, and she gets pulled – maybe, I don’t know,
doesn’t have her taillight working or something and gets pulled, and
it’s discovered that there’s a gun in there. She could be hit with a
felony when she doesn’t even know what’s happening. This bill that… this
should be treated still as a class 2 misdemeanor on the first offence.
We have no opposition to treating a second or third offence as a felony,
but feel that this is a bit steep for a first offence that could be
inadvertent, and how do you prove it? I’ve been ticketed before for
shooting doves over bate when I had no idea the field was bated and that
didn’t make any difference before the law, and I just feel like that we
shouldn’t punish someone for an inadvertent violation as strictly as you
would someone who knows that they are violating, so ‘d appreciate if
you’d accept this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from New Hanover, Representative Davis, rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has
the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I would simply state that of course for someone to be convicted
of a crime, the state of North Carolina’s going to have to prove their
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, so I think if somebody is inadvertently
doing something and doesn’t have any willful intent, I don’t believe
they would be convicted, so I would ask that you vote against the
amendment and leave the language as it was. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is Amendment 9, sent forth by Representative Pittman. So many
favoring adoption of the amendment will vote aye. Those opposed will
vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine
and record the vote. 46 having voted in the affirmative and 70 in the
negative, the amendment is not adopted. Further discussion, further
debate on the House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 594 as amended?
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman may make his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, do I need
to make that motion to set aside the rules so we can have third reading
or is that just kind of assumed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] so I need to make a motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Wake is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pursuant to my previous agreement, I would make a motion that we set
aside the rules to the end to allow for third reading tonight. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake moves that the rules be suspended for
the purposes of allowing the House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill
594 to have its third reading. Further discussion, further debate? If
not, so many favoring the motion will vote aye. Those opposed will vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote. 111 having voted in the affirmative and 5 in the
negative, the motion to suspend the rules passes. The question before
the House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for Senate
Bill 594 on its third reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will
vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The
Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 75 having voted in the
affirmative and 40 in the negative, the House Committee Substitute for
Senate Bill 594 passes its third reading and will be sent to the Senate.
It will be engrossed and returned to the Senate. Thank you Madam Clerk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] for what purpose does
the lady from Franklin, Representative Richardson rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I would like to be recorded as voting yes on
Representative Jackson’s motion previously. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady
will be recorded as having voted aye.</p>

Information From Records Available on Internet Websites Maintained by
Counties and Cities When Requested by Certain Law Enforcement Personnel,
Prosecutors, and Judicial Officers. The General Assembly of North

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Make a motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We want to remove this from the calendar today and put

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without object-, the question before the House is to
remove the bill from today's calendar and that the bill be re-calendared
for tomorrow. Is there objection? Hearing none, so ordered.
Senate Bill 85, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 85, a bill

Year Clinical Rotations for North Carolina Allopathic and Osteopathic
Medical Students and the Availability of Graduate Medical Education
Positions for North Carolina Allopathic and Osteopathic Medical School
Graduates. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, may I send forward Amendment ARF-27?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Member is recognized to send forth the amendment, the
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is Amendment ARF-27B2. Representative Lewis moves
to amend the bill on page 1, lines 8 through 16, by deleting those lines
and by renumbering the remaining sections accordingly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Harnett has the floor to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment removes, as it
says, lines 8 through 16 of the bill. Those lines would have allotted
25% of clerkships at UNC hospitals to third and fourth year medical
students at other accredited universities. I met with UNC and they have
expressed to me that there is a concern with the accreditation based on
this part. I know of no opposition to removing part 1 of this bill and
would respectfully ask for support from the body to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not, the question before the House is the adoption of Amendment 1
sent forth by Representative Lewis. So many favoring adoption of the
amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The Clerk will open
the vote.
Does the gentleman from Henderson County wish to be recorded on this?
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. One hundred and
sixteen having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, the
amendment is adopted.
The gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis, is recognized to
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The bill as amended that you
have before you is really pretty straight forward. It just recognizes
that our state is blessed to have five medical schools in or state which
trains future doctors to go out and to serve our population. It
recognizes and acknowledges that one of those schools is much larger and
more dominate than the other four. And it merely says that those other
four will have a shot at getting the clerkships or what's called
clinical rotations which the third and fourth year spots at hospitals in
order to complete their training. It in no way interferes with any
existing agreement that any school has with any medical institutions.
And I would ask for support of the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 85 on its second reading. So many favoring
adoption of the bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The
Clerk will open the vote.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker. This is just another bill that's
going to help us in our efforts to become the most military and veteran
friendly state in the nation, and as a courtesy, we had a companion bill
but the Senate allowed us to run the modifying of the internal auditing
statutes in 2013 and in return, we allowed them to run this bill and we
would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Transylvania,
Representative Whitmire, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For all friends of the House here, this is an
incredibly important bill and as we, on the verge of many any of our
active duty members being lifted, reduced in force and joining the
civilian world in one form or another, this is incredibly important for
workforce development and also a veteran bill. And I personally would
much rather have someone that could show up for work on time, has their
act together, and brings a unique skill set with many, many hands-on
experiences in a lot of environments to join our workforce. And instead
of being motivated to go to some other state that more readily gives
them credit where credit's due with civilian equivalency for their
military training. So I ask that you support this bill wholeheartedly.
Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to speak to a point of
personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Over the weekend, the state
and especially The Outer Banks lost a good friend, Sterling Webster.
Many of you may know him in his role as the Chair of the North Carolina
Restaurant and Lodging Association a couple of years ago, passed away.
He was the Chair of The Outer Banks Chamber of Commerce, the Roanoke
Island Festival Park, the Visitor's Bureau and many other organizations
on The Outer Banks. And he was smart enough never to run for office, but
still did a lot of good for our community.
I always considered him a mentor to me and what I have found over the
past few days is that I was not alone. Many people have approached me
expressing their sadness at losing their mentor, as well.
He was the one who got me involved in our community. I had met him in
college and when I moved to The Outer Banks I called him and said,
&quot;I just want to get involved, what should I do?&quot; He said,
&quot;Show up at the Rotary at 1:00 and I'll have a sponsor there
waiting for you.&quot; And I showed up and I did.
He was a good friend to the state and The Outer Banks and I just ask you
to keep Sterling Webster and his family in your prayers. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Lee,
Representative Stone, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may speak for a moment of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I want
to share with you today that as a father, we have many opportunities to
be a part of our children's life, but seldom do we become the first to
see something because my wife tends to beat me to it. Whether it was
walking or reading or what, but today, today, I finally beat my wife. I
took my son out on a pier at 7:30 this morning. By 10:00 he caught he
first two fish, and I don't know what I was more happy about. The fact
that I saw something first or the fact that he did it, but I couldn't
wait for her to walk out on the pier so I could show her the pictures
and then tell her I saw it first. So, I enjoyed the moment.
[applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is reminded that his wife might even be
listening to session tonight, so...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For the record, I did not 'beat' my wife.
