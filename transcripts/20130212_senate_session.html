[SOUND] Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms will close the
doors. Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the
gallery, please silence all your electronic devices. Leading the Senate
in prayer is the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and
guests in the gallery, please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s pray.
Heavenly father, we’re grateful to you today for somehow you have called
us as people, as a community, into this great effort to see your world
as a better place. And we want the beauty of your life to live here. To
change and to rescue and to beautify, do all the things that make this
place look a little bit more like heaven somehow. Give us tastes of it.
We your people are your image bearers. Use us as your children, created
to resemble your beauty. So my prayer for this body today is that they
would know that they are made in the image of God. They are first image
bearers. May that reality sink in today. You’re an awesome God. An
awesome artist. May your fresh beauty fall down on these men and women,
who have been created in your image. In the name of Jesus, we pray.
Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger is recognized for a motion.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 4: Unemployment Insurance Fund Solvency and Program Changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, to present the House bill 4.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. House Bill 4
came over from the house in an effort to try to provide solvency with
the unemployment fund which, according to testimony by the past chairman
of the Employment Security Commission, was insolvent in the year 2009
and has remained that way even until today. We continue to be bleeding
on a weekly and monthly basis because we're actually receiving less
money than goes out in benefits, and we continue borrowing money from
the federal government. Our goal with this bill is to provide solvency
and to be sure that there is an unemployment fund for the citizens of
this state as we face future unemployment problems or, potentially,
another recession. At this moment we're not sitting there. What this
bill tries to do is one in four parts increase the number of groups
paying into the system, that includes the non-for-profits it includes
cities and county and municipal governments who are put on a debit card
type of arrangement where as they have unemployment experiences they
will draw down from that unemployment and replenish it. There's been
special consideration because of the challenges  that the cities and
counties have a little longer time to get to achieve the level of one
percent of their unemployment benefits, but they are given a little bit
more time to accomplish that. The second thing, and what the intent of
this, was too try to provide resources while someone is let go from
their job for no reason but unfortunately a slow down in business and
their job was lost; and what this really should be called is
reemployment rather than an unemployment fund. We're trying to put in
North Carolinians back to work. What we're also doing is we are focusing
a lot of attention and a lot of resources on the retraining prograsm
which prepared our citizens for the new global jobs. Example: we have a
number of welding jobs we're going to have training programs to help
them prepare so that they can finish the program and be able to have
gainful employment and become part of the American dream. The
businesses, now, there seems to be a misunderstanding out here because
people think that they actually provide funds for this. The only people
that pay for the unemployment fund are the businesses in the state of
North Carolina would pay the lion share, plus the organizations like the
not-for-profit and/or city and state governments. Those are the groups
that actually pay the bills not only the benefits that are paid for our
unemployed but, more importantly, the interest too. So between the FUTA
and SUTA taxes, there is a source of revenue basically from the business
community who, under these economic times, are in great distress trying
to survive and the last thing we really do is put additional burden on
them, but unfortunately the federal government requires us to pay
interest and to also pay down the debt. And for every year that we have
a debt with the federal government on this and, ladies and gentlemen of
the Senate, we are at about 2.5 billion dollars; that's four times worse
than its ever been to in the history of the fund. So in reality we have
a monumental task to reestablish solvency, but there is an automatic</p>

<p id="15:00">
?? What that basically means, a person could have lost a job where they
were making anywhere between $30,000 to $50,000 a year. If they were
getting that minimum benefit of basically $350 a week a job came along
that $22,000 a year, they’d be forced to take it. What this bill does,
it gives them a little more latitude. A little bit more capacity to seek
employment that’s more comparable to the employment that they left
because it sets it at 140% of the weekly benefit. It also strikes a
balance. You look at the $535 end, you look at $350 on the other. What
this amendment would do is set it right smack in the middle at $442 a
week. I think it’s a far more reasonable place for us to be.
Now what it would require, in terms of funds to get us there, is a
minute contribution from employees, less that one half of one per cent
to help us get there. Now, we were able to contribute that and I don’t
think there’d be a big problem with that. We have other states that are
doing it that way. States like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Alaska. It can
get us solvent in the same amount of time as the original bill.
Again, the highlight. Employers will pay no more. We have employees able
to receive additional benefits up to $442 a week, will make certain that
when alternative employment that comes around they can take jobs that
may not be comparable to the jobs they left, but certainly not jobs that
will put them in a position where they have to take $22,000 a year when
they might have left a job that paid $30 or $40 or $50,000 a year. And,
most importantly, it gets our state to a point where we will be solvent
in terms of our unemployment compensation fund. What this bill basically
does as well is that contributions to employees, we get it to $1 billion
and we’re solvent, it falls off. If we fall below the $1 billion again,
it kicks back in. But it keeps us solvent. Everybody has some skin in
the game. Everybody contributes a bit, but it achieves a reasonable,
equitable, fair balance, and it doesn’t do it on the unemployed that are
less fortunate, it doesn’t put a burden on those that are using this
fund to buy them the necessities of life. It does not impose an undue
burden upon anyone, but we all have skin in the game. We all share in
what we need to do to get our unemployment fund solvent. It pays the
debt out off in exactly the same amount of time as the original bill. If
we were in any other chamber in any other situation, here in North
Carolina, and we had people sitting around the table trying to come up
with a compromise that is fair and reasonable and balanced, this is a
point, and this is a position where we would logically get to. I ask you
today to forget about party affiliation, look at what’s good for the
solvency of the state of North Carolina, look at what’s good for our
employees. Look at what’s good to make our unemployment compensation
fund solvent. Give this idea, give this concept some thoughtful
reflection. You can vote it down in an instant, but you’ll be voting
down an opportunity to be fair, an opportunity to be more compassionate
with those citizens that find theirselves in these points in their lives
where they really have no place else to turn to. I’ve met so many people
that’ve been unemployed over the last five years that it hurts and it
burdens my heart to know that frequently the only thing they have is
this lifeline of survival in a critical time of need. We should be aware
of that. We should try to strike that reasonable balance that this
amendment offers. Thank you.

You know, Senator McKissick makes some very good points and I always
enjoy hearing his commentary and I think everyone in this room feels
sorry for those who are not working and need a lifeline sent to them and
looked after. As you read through this, as they say, the devil’s in the
details. Page 1 line 12 and 13. It is hard for me to fathom that we go
to folks working now and say we’re going to add a tax to you to pay
additionally at the end of the year or whenever with the things they’re
already facing as working and employed and having to raise families and
make ends meet, so I understand what we’re trying to do here and I think

hit the nail on the head we try to be as fair and equitable as we could
when we dealt with the 2.4 billion or 2.5 it's up to now that we owe the
feds but I cant see placing that on the backs of the working people so
for that reason I'll have to vote against this amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho has the floor to speak
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
excuse me not on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
speak to the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
debate on the amendment sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick had someone arrainged this same idea in its original
format because in reality a fairer way would be like we do for health
insurance, disability insurance, unemployment insurance was done this
way it would probably be a better way of accomplishing in the future but
unfortunately for this we've already studied this completely.
Representative Howard has done a tremendous job in putting together a
Bill from the House side that will deliver by 2015 paid off all the debt
and the interest plus in a very short period after that a billion
dollars worth of reserves and this is to important an issue to take a
risk with this kind of unstudied plan so in reality I will say to you
that I urge the members of the Senate to vote oppose against this
Amendment so that we can move this bill forward and provide solvency to
a very important unemployment insurance fund.  It is something that is
critical at this time and the faster we can get out and in place
everybody can make plans for how this will be implemented thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
any further discussion or debate?

Mr President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
speak a second time on the Amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak a second time
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's unfortunate that we aren't at the point in time when we can
thoughtfully look at opportunities to strike these type of reasonable
balances things that really would be pure compromises in any other
context other than within the confines of this room when we feel as if
we need to stick with the caucus or stick with a collective position
cause this represents a reasonable compromise of competing interests it
does not burden employers who we have heard so much about and it does
get the debt paid back in the same amount of time that we need to. With
that said I can read the handwriting on the wall so I withdraw the
amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick withdraws amendment 1 so the bill unamended is back
before us is there any further discussion or debate?  Senator Nesbitt
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You Mr President. Sent forth an amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
they should have yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt moves to amend the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt is recognized to explain the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you Mr President and members of the Senate I will tell you to the
best of my knowledge to those who were in the finance committee this is
the same amendment I ran in the committee it's rather hard to read but
its pretty simple in process. It basically puts the effective date off
until January.  Were in a situation where and you've seen the numbers we
have a tremendous number of people that are gonna be laid off of the
extended benefits. I think we've estimated that some 170 thousand people
when its said and done will lose those benefits and the state will lose
the income which I think is badly needed right now to get this economy
restarted. the reason were having this difficulty with the un-insurance
fund is because this recession has gone on now forever. This system
worked well since 1930 something and all of a sudden we have a deep deep
recession I think it was a depression I thin the country was permanently
devalued and it has lasted so long that it is put us in this shape and I
think when we get a little bit of money back in the flow in this economy
in North Carolina you'll see it come back around. I was talking with the
home builders earlier today and they lost 100 thousand workers, until
you get that construction</p>

?? industry moving again, you're not going to have decent employment in
this state, period. I offered this in the committee and we had a
discussion about whether or not that delay of 6 months would mean that
you'd have to pay an extra year of the penalties---for business, not
that I would want that to happen. If you read the bill, there's a
provision in there that sets up a committee to look at this and monitor
it and make recommendations and stuff as to what we can do. And I'm
telling you, this is a real possibility, if you go over into that
year---I think it was '16---anyhow, if this county doesn't pick back up,
your assumptions are wrong; it's going to take longer to pay it back.
There are any number of ways to prevent that from happening and giving
business some certainty out here. I had my Chief of Staff make some
calls to the Treasurer's office today---and the Treasurer's out of state
at the moment, so I couldn't speak with her---but I spoke with them
about the possibility of taxpayer anticipation notes. If you get to the
year '15 and it looks like you're going to have $400 million left, which
would ?? all the penalties for '16, I think at that time you could issue
those taxpayer anticipation notes for that $400 million, pay for it out
of the ?? fund---you could even increase the ?? tax to pay for it---and
business would get a better deal than they'd get in paying that penalty.
And that would keep it from going over into the next year. There are any
number of ways to do this. I keep running into a brick wall when I try
to do something, and I've reached the conclusion that there are those in
the state that don't want people to have these benefits. And you hear
some of the anecdotal stuff about how there are people that are just
deadbeats out here: I can tell you this, when you think of the 100,000
people leaving the construction industry, those are hardworking people
and I guarantee you every one of them would take a job if they could
find one. There just ISN'T one. Nothing's being built right now. And
they probably don't have the skills to take modern-day jobs; I know some
of them are getting them. But they just don't have a job, and that's
what's going on out there. If we want to---and Senator McKissick offered
you an amendment a while ago that showed you plenty of alternative ways
to do this that doesn't hurt these people that are unemployed---I'm
offering you something that will keep all of the long-term unemployed
receiving benefits until they expire in January. It's a win-win for this
state. The old saying is, &quot;I can keep telling you, but I can't make
you understand.&quot; And I've done about all of it I know to do, but if
we don't take advantage of this situation and we flush all that money,
it'll be because that's what you wanted to do, not because that's what
we had to do. And I would urge you to pass the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President---
[OVERLAPPING VOICES]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We did discuss this at length during the Finance Committee, and it was
clear that any further extension or changing of the provisions of the
bills, including the weekly benefits, will cause an extension; and the
analysis we looked at from Upjohn showed that it would probably take a
year in additional time, which would force the businesses to go up to
about $140 per employee---if I'm correct about that, but I'm sure it's
higher than what it is under the proposal. And when you talk about
putting people back to work by increasing taxes which could lead to
about 400 million new dollars above what the---already---burden is on
the business community to pay this back, both interest and principal,
then that does nothing by adding additional cost on businesses to create
more jobs, that will probably LOSE jobs. And there are members in this
Senate that could discuss that with you as they've analyzed this bill
and this proposal, trying to decide how it would impact THEIR
businesses. And what we fear is that there will be an increase in
unemployment, rather than a decrease, and that would be a contrary
indicator to what we're trying to accomplish here, and that's put people
back to work and get this fund solvent. And we've got a nice,
broad-based approach, well-documented---

Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, with what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As Senator Nesbitt already identified, there's tax exempts into ??
notes, you can lower the suitor rate. There's a number of mechanisms
available in the year 2015 to deal with this three to four hundred
million in extra ?? taxes that may get imposed in 2016. That's assuming
that it actually does get paid off in 2015. If it goes to November 12 or
13, 2015, that extra ?? of tax is gonna be imposed under your plan
anyway for 2016. But the point is, let's just assume that happens. Let's
assume that there's three to four hundred million in ?? and taxes that
have to be paid in 2015, and we've paid it off that much later. Well,
where does that extra three to four hundred million go? It goes to us.
It goes to our account, it goes to our savings account to build the
balance back up. It's a forced savings program, and what happens when
that account gets up to a billion dollars? Well, then automatic
statutory trigger lowers the ?? taxes. It's not like this money is going
anywhere other than to our own benefit, our own fund balanced account,
so what we're trading off is paying a little bit extra on food and taxes
that goes back into our own pocket in 2016 for 780 million dollars in
benefit today, which the Secretary of Labor just sent us out, gets
multiplied by a factor of 2 when going through the economy. That is
money that goes to pay landlords, that is money that goes to drug
stores, supermarkets. That is money that goes in people's gas tanks, to
car repair. This is economic development for 170,000 people in 2013,
today, when we have 9.2% unemployment and we need this economic activity
desperately. Please vote for this amendment. Even if you want to
permanently shrink unemployment benefits for injured people, I mean
unemployed people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own and
are actively looking for work today. Please vote for this amendment.

saved us all of this challenge, which may have unfortunately fell on
death ears from our delegation in the senate, and so under that program
it put us under a disadvantage. Yet we were still committed and still
required to get this fund solvent, but Senator Stein at any point during
the year we could get a grandfather from the department of labor, as
they did in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Arkansas, and Rhode Island, to allow
us to do that and when that happens we can make the adjustments
accordingly, but til then we cannot afford to pull 400 million in new
dollars out of this economy, which will cause some additional
unemployment increases and will put an additional burden, and we'll
probably have a bigger problem with unemployment than we presently have.
I will reiterate the fact that I believe the amendment number 2 should
be defeated.

few members. This amendment would only do three things and that’s to
allow good causes for leaving. It would allow a worker to draw
unemployment if the reason for leaving is a disability or the health of
an immediate family member. If it’s undue hardship in the family, such
as not being able to have someone to care for a child that’s in your
legal custody or a spouse relocation, if your spouse leaves to relocate
to a job and you have to leave because of the distance, that would be a
good cause. I’ve talked to staff, there is no cost, it’s negligible cost
if anything. I just think this makes good sense for people that will not
be able to work for good causes and that’s all this amendment adds to
the bill. I ask you to vote for this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate amendment number three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho to debate amendment three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whenever you are adding benefits and extending benefits, you’re adding
cost to it, there’s no way around that. Something we need to remember,
why this unemployment insurance fund was put together and that was to
provide a bridge for those that have lost their jobs for no reason of
their own, and what that means is that it is to re-employ that
individual. Now, there is some circumstances that Senator Parmon set
forward, which should be managed by another government assistance
program and not by the unemployment program. This is the kind of changes
that’ve been made over the last number of years by adding additional
benefit upon benefit, similar to what they’ve done on social security
that has caused these programs to get insolvent. By doing that, all
we’re doing is contributing to the problem and what we’re going to see
is a bigger problem in the future and I would recommend, Senator Parmon,
look at an additional government program to try achieve her goal…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...and I’ll finish speaking first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho will finish speaking Senator Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...and try to finish. Look at this as a way, or another way of managing
this particular concern that she has. That being said, amendment number
three, I would recommend that the Senate say no to amendment number
three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt. for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, if you look at these three reasons that were pointed out,
I think Senator Parmon is trying to show you how easy it would be to
help in certain instances. The one that section four, as I read it, a
single mom making minimum wage somewhere, is laid off because she can’t
work the night shift because she doesn’t have anybody to keep her child,
is not entitled to draw unemployment benefits while she finds another
job. What do we have the unemployment fund for? That’s the same thing as
being fired if you’re put in the choice of whether or not you leave your
child by themselves or you go to work? That’s not anything that’s
reasonable. I’ve been told all day that all of this was decided at some
higher level and we’re not going to consider any reasonable amendments
in here, but I wasn’t told that by a Senator, by the way, that was by
the crowd that’s lobbying us, but for goodness sakes, slow down a little
bit and look at some of this stuff. Some of it just makes sense. These
people don’t have another choice. You got to give them a choice. Thank
you.

Senator McLaurin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to speak to the bill
and offer an amendment. I think it's been distributed. First of all, I
want to say to Senator Rucho...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, we need to read the amendment in before you
speak to it, so the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McLaurin moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McLaurin has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much. Senator Rucho and those who
drafted the bill, let me say as a businessman for over 30 years, I
commend you for the efforts to reform our unemployment insurance program
and process, and I think the emphasis on re-training, preparing people
for new jobs in the marketplace are certainly something very positive as
a result of this, and so hopefully it will help get people more back
into the workforce. But I'm trying to simplify this by the concern I
have about the rural communities. I represent five counties in the
Senate, two of them have unemployment around 12%, one has unemployment
almost at 17%. And the section that, 9614.3, Duration of Benefits, I'm
simply just saying that we eliminate the section that applies to the
duration of payments corresponding to State-wide unemployment rate. In
counties like Scotland County, which has an almost 17% unemployment
rate, frankly, unemployment rate is always higher than the State-wide
average. And I'm saying that those rural communities, many of which you
all represent here in this body, would benefit from perhaps receiving 20
weeks pay and so the sliding scale would just in effect be eliminated as
a result of this amendment. And I think it would help rural counties all
across North Carolina who frankly always have higher unemployment rate
than the State average. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate Amendment No. 4, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho has the floor to debate Amendment 4.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is welcome to have one of our colleagues, a
business colleague from the back row coming forward with suggestions. We
are always welcome those good ideas, but in this case, what we see here
is something that would, the bill is crafted very tightly so that it is
a balanced bill. And what we're trying to do is find no way of adding to
the cost of the employers in this situation. And what I see here is that
it will add to that cost. So under that circumstance I would say that
Amendment 4 should be defeated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 4. All in favor
will vote aye, oppose the vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting and the clerk will record the vote.
Seventeen having voted in the affirmative and thirty-two in the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Woodard, you have the floor to speak to your
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. There's an old saying,
&quot;Never let a good crisis go to waste.&quot; Ladies and gentlemen of
the Senate, that is exactly what House Bill 4 is doing. It is using the
crisis of the great recession and unprecedented unemployment to
drastically alter our State's unemployment insurance program. Not just
to get us through this Federal debt crisis, but to alter the system
permanently. This amendment very simply proposes that businesses and our
unemployed citizens share the pain of this...</p>

<p id="45:00">
Crisis, until our debt has been paid back to the federal government. But
once that obligation has been met then our program returns to its
current structure. make no mistake during this repayment period, the
provisions of this bill will be difficult for unemployed residents.
Their benefit cuts will outweigh employers federal and state tax costs
by more than two to one. But as proposed this bill prolongs the pain
after the debt is paid by eliminating the employers additional -
additional employers costs, but retain the benefit cuts permanently.
Ladies and gentleman this is a drastic reform of our unemployment
insurance. A total recalibrating of the balance system we have
maintained for years.
And it's done under the duress of this debt payback. The notion that
significantly decreased unemployment taxes will create jobs and attract
businesses form other states, flies in the face of logic and of reality.
A small business owner from my district just emailed me just this very
morning the point of [??] that these payments represent just a few cents
of the hourly compensation costs to his business. And this amendment
would not reset our system to some funding scheme proposed this year or
in 2011 but instead returns it to the law where it was back in 1993. So
when it comes to unemployment insurance, ladies and gentlemen we've dug
ourselves into a hole that we must climb out. But please, please, don't
leave our unemployed workers down there when the rest of us get out. I
urge you to adopt this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise? To speak
on the amendment please. Senator Apodaca you have the floor to speak on
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There's another old saying the best way to predict
future behavior is to look at past behavior, So, with that in mind, if
we sit here and say, oh, okay, what we've done is correct, and moving
forward it's gonna be different, I think that's another definition of
something that's not right. So in looking at this I don't know why in
the world we'd want to go back to the way we used to be, that's what got
us here to begin with. So I ask that we defeat this amendment. Thank
you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good ol' eastern North Carolina boy and mountain
resident like senator Apodaca we could probbaly trade old sayings all
day, and I certainly wouldn't suggest that we keep going back, but lets
not make a decision. Let's not drastically alter and overhaul the
current system, flawed though it may be, under duress. We're in the
bottom of the well, the rain is coming, lets get out of that before we
totally alter and make permanent decisions on our unemployment insurance
system. I would urge you to approve the amendment. Lets back up and lets
take a look at this some future time. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill and to ask Senator Rucho a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho would you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho this whole system was built on a
principle, which is you have a trust fund that you build in a good
economy and then it's there during the lean times when the economy goes
down those funds are there. Do you know how many time sin the 1990's
employers came to this legislature and got cuts of their contribution
when times were flush?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will say to you Senator Kinnaird that during the
nineties there was over a billion dollars of assets available in the
fund and continually growing...</p>

[??] times were good. And along with that there was a reduction in the
rate, there was also an increase in the benefits, and in that
circumstance that is a bad combination. What we are doing in this bill
is establishing comparable benefit rates, benefits available for the
unemployment that will allow them to sustain until they can find their
next job. And more importantly we're also putting trigger mechanisms in
there that if the fund drops below a certain level there's an automatic
tax increase on the employers so that we constantly leave that funding
there so that we can guarantee that we'll have a good reserve fund in
there for the hard times, and also make sure that our fund remains
solvent and physically in balance. And yes that is how we are trying to
handle the good and the bad times.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll tell you how many times, six reductions during
the good times, the fat years. Just like the bible says, the fat years.
Ninety-two, temporary appeal of the 20% surcharge put on in
eighty-seven. Ninety-three the standard combination rate was cut from
3.7 to 2.25. In Ninety-four again from 2.25 to 1.8, and on and on and
on. A billion dollars. The principle is that we put a trust fund in a
position to take care of those times, and yet over and over the
employers came as so there were no lean times ever coming up. This is a
bad bill because it hurts the employees. The employers asked for help
then, we gave them help, and yet we're not giving employees help this
time around. And I think that Senator Woodward's position is very
important, we're making it permanent, we're not even using the
principles that we've had, trigger yes but we've already cut these so
low that it's almost meaningless. We are hurting our people. We helped
their employers when they asked for our help even though it wasn't the
wisest thing to do. And now why aren't we helping our employees? I urge
you to vote against the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.President to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman of the senate, I've been
reluctant to speak out but being a small business owner I certainly wan
to take this opportunity to somewhat take up for the businesses that are
represented here in this state that Senator Kinnaird, employ people, not
the unemployed. We employ people. I was vocal in opposition of this bill
early on, I will vote for it today because my business, other businesses
didn't start this recession. We didn't have anything to do with making
this recession. We didn't make the decisions in the nineties and in the
two thousands to reduce the rate  to employers. They came and asked and
those people in charge then on the other side of the aisle should have
said no, because as you've said Ms. Kinnaird it was not a wise decision.
That's why we find ourselves in this position today.
I didn't set the rates for unemployment in the nineties and in the two
thousands, and I did not have anything to do when the recession hit for
the lack of rainy day fund. Physical staff said we had $440 million
dollars available when the recession hit, because those in charge never
planned as if, you said senator Kinnaird, a recession. And so what
happened? We drew is out in a matter of a month. So when we run the
numbers out I talked to my controller before this session. Senartor
Kinnaird these evil companies who provide jobs for people like mine, we
went form 104 people down to 34 in the recession. I almost lost my
business.
And one of the things Raleigh doesn't get is the last person to get paid
in a recession is the owner of the business. I joke sometimes but I've
gone through this scenario, you haven't lived in business until you pay
payroll on a credit card. And let me tell you, that's a tough time. But
my business is 40 years old and it survived, but my controller tells me
that we're gonna pay roughly $1429 per employee...</p>

I too, understand that we have a responsibility to be fiscal stable, and
I do think we need to do all we can to get there.  But earlier, Senator
Rucho stated the people in my amendment could get help from some other
agency, I'm not sure whether he said government or not, but I don't know
of another agency that helped the people that my amendment addressed.
And, I get it, that some people may think that after having worked a
number of years and getting laid off, that some people have become
dependent on unemployment benefits, but what I don't get is that this
bill that we're debating here today, that on July 1st, 2013, cuts out
benefits for more than 170,000 workers in this state.  And although
these benefits are 100% federally funded, and would bring an estimated
$780 million into this state to help families make ends meet while
unemployed and seeking work.  Earlier, as the Chaplain was planning, and
he said something similar to us in North Carolina seeing our state is a
little piece of heaven, as we  talked about this piece of legislation,
my mind was also drawn to Proverbs, Erb Chapter around the 27th verse
and it reads,  Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is
in the power of thine hands to do it.  And colleagues I submit to you,
that you have the power to do the right thing for the unemployed
citizens of this state today, by voting no on this bill.  I will be
voting no.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion, further debate.  Senator McKissick,
for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator McKissick, you have the floor to speak on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Let me be pretty brief, but to the point.  If this bill
had been in effect back in 2008, when this recession hit, of the people
that received unemployment benefits today, if you had looked having an
effect that $350 maximum benefit, we'd have over 132,000 people would
have been negatively impacted. 132,000 who would have been impacted by
that benefit reduction, $535 a week to $350 a week.  That's a real face.
 If you looked at how many would have been impacted had this bill been
in place in 2008, a reduction in the number of weeks, from 26 weeks down
to 20, yes, putting it at 20, you're talking about 2/3rds of the people,
roughly about 440,000.  That's the difference it would have made over
the last 5 years or so, since 2008.  And our economy, while it's picking
up steam today, and our unemployment rates still up around 9.2%, had
those benefits not come into people's hand, and they haven't been
spending that money, we wouldn't even be spuming around long at that
pace, the unemployment rate would be even higher.  And it's almost
inconceivable that we in North Carolina are about to turn away
approximately $800 million in federal benefits that are free to us.
Absolutely free. $800 million, another 170,000 people we'll turn our
back upon.  I hate to think of the way this will be cast, not just here
in North Carolina, but outside of North Carolina, in terms of our law
makers putting this type of Draconian policy into place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr, President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Jackson, for what purpose do you rise?

listened to the pros and the cons of this bill.  And Senator Tucker, I
want to tell you, I'd don't guess I've ever been unemployed, but I've
been broke many times, broker and borrowing on credit cards, when you
have to borrow money from an employee to make payroll.  I've been there,
and it's unfair.  So, I've got compassion for these unemployed</p>

people. I've been in their shoes, but we've talked about hindsight
things, what we should have could have done. I can't control hindsight
folks, and there's no one sitting in this room right now that can change
the past. Because if they could, we'd all have done things differently.
I did not like this bill, I like Senator Tucker ???, Senator Rucho for
three months probably, about this bill at least. I still am not crazy
about this bill. But, it is the best alternative we've got at this time.
Our forefathers that stood on this floor, when they reduced those
benefits ???, that what they thought was right. And I was sent up here
to make hard decisions. And I have made some hard decisions in my life.
And this is one of them. But we've got to look to the future, we've got
to have hope that things are gonna get better, and Senator Nesbitt, you
were right, I don't anybody anywhere knew this recession or depression,
as you call it, and I agree, was gonna last this long. But we have got
to give our employers a fair and balanced program. And we have not had
that. But we do have it in this bill. No, it's not perfect, and no, it's
not gonna solve all our woes here in this state, but it is a step in the
right direction. And I believe, from the bottom of my heart, that was
part of the reason I was sent to Raleigh, was to make these hard
decisions. And I encourage you to vote for this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant for a purpose to your eyes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to make a few comments about the balance in the bill between
what we need to do for employers to pay the debt, and also for what we
need to do for the unemployed workers and their families, remembering
that we're talking about people unemployed through no fault of their
own. I think I could, though I disagree, feel more comfortable if the
bill did just what it needed to do to address the physical aspects, the
monetary aspects of the problem we face. That is, what we really need to
do to pay the debt off, to minimize the exposure of our employers to the
twenty-one-dollar-per-employee penalty, showing that time period, all of
that. There are other aspects of this bill that are punitive to workers
that are saying somehow we feel like you aren't good enough to be, to
have the respect of the benefits that we have previously offered you.
Such is the changing of the Good Calls Provisions and requiring, and the
provisions of suitable work. Requiring people regardless of the class of
work they have been engaged in to be required to take any level of job
offered them or lose all benefits for themselves or their families. To
not regard issues of the reasons for being out of work beyond our means,
beyond our control like the disability of yourself or your family, for
example. There are certain provisions like that are just punitive and
harsh to workers that have no relationship to the monetary arrangements
we need to make to get the debt paid off, and I just feel we need to be
honest about that. And, separate, and this was hard for me to just sit
and hear that the fiscal aspects without amplifying that part. And I
wish we would be willing to be fair about that part to our workers and
not add punitive provisions to them in addition to the monetary changes
that we feel a need to make in order to pay back the debt and reduce the
burden on the employers. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Senate is the passage of the Committee Substitute House Bill 4 on its

substitute House Bill 4 passes its second reading and will remain on the

Future Farmers of America up in the gallery.  If any of you are left up
here would you please stand? I don't see them in the gallery today but
if you see these young folks walking around with their blue jackets on
make sure you say hello to them.  Obviously agriculture is a $70 billion
industry in our state and these folks are keeping it going. So thank
them when you see them.  Also I'd like to upon a motion of Senator
Graham, Ford, Tarte, Rucho and Clodfelter of Mecklenburg County the
Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to Loren Phelps,
Charlie Palmer, Jason Hartzo and Edward Brenson if they're still with us
as members of the UNC-Charlotte Student Government.  Are they still here

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  Members.  Senator ?? gave a
very eloquent rendition or historical account of streaking in the paper
the other day and I thought that was quite informative.  I don't know
where to go with that so we're going to switch tactics but one of the
first college campuses streaking happened at I think it's in the
Guinness Book of World Records was Western Carolina University and it is
also a little known fact that Senator Brock was the original streaker at
Western so give him a congratulations when you see him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further business to come before the
Senate? Senator Tillman for what purpose do you rise?
