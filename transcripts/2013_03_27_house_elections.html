[Speaker changes.] Gavel...House Committee on Elections will please come
to order. Members will take their seats.  Chair would like to begin by
extending his thanks to our pages who are here today: Deanna
Austin???????, Drew Mag?????? and Bailey ????????  Thank you so much for
being with us and, of course, our House Sargent-at-Arms Staff always
does such a good job...John Brandon, Fred Hines and Billy Jones.  Ladies
and gentlemen, the first bill on the agenda today is House Bill 11.
Chair is going to recognize Representative Warren to present that bill;
however, there is a proposed Committee Substitute for that bill and the
Chair has been assured by Staff that all of the changes in the proposed
Committee Substitute are technical in nature but the Chair will
certainly allow the Staff to explain ????????   But, Representative
Warren, you have the floor and, upon motion from Representative Bert
Jones, the proposed Committee Substitute is before us for discussion.
Without objection, so ordered, you have the floor...Representative
Warren.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. Afternoon ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for giving me a few minutes to present this bill.
This bill was filed last year and passed out of the House on a vote of
69 to 44 with five members not present and two not voting. It is the
same bill that passed over to the Senate and languished over there.
Hopefully we wanna get that through.  What the bill does is...Special
Election Bill requires that any special election or referendum will be
held on the same time as any county or municipality general election. It
does make exceptions for special elections related to public health or
safety and recall elections.  If you look at your bill summary, the
second page under bill analysis...first couple paragraphs and the bullet
points pretty much explain the bill.  The rest of it is just conforming
language.  The reason I put the bill out there is to ensure that when an
issue is put before the public to vote on, that it is put on at such a
time that the majority of the public or the electorate is available to
vote on it. To give you a quick example, over the last three years,
we've have 43 special elections...the average voter turnout was 11.9%.
Some of the typical special elections are a tax referendums.  Another
example is .... I will forego naming the counties...the county sales tax
referendum where they're at 34,900 eligible voters...2300 decided the
fate ... that was a 6.8% turnout. In another county tax referendum,
108,400 eligible voters...3800 decided...that was a 3.5% voter turnout.
And I've got plenty more examples like that...actually much more....in
fact, this one I like. There's 14,684 voters...349 made a decision. That
was 2.3% voter turnout. When I passed the bill last year, we had the
?????????? municipalities and the Mayor's Coalition and the North
Carolina Association of County Commissioners took no position on the
bill.  The Chamber didn't take any position on the bill either. And this
bill was filed on January 30th this year and no one has expressed any
complaints to me about this bill so I put it before you and ask for your
kind support.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To offer a favorable motion when the time is
appropriate.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, ma'am...the Chair will come back.
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Just...thank you, Mister Chairman, just how does this
effect any...for instance, if a member of Congress gets elected and dies
within, say three months of his taking office, how does this effect
that?
[Speaker changes.] I'm gonna refer to...defer that question to Staff
here please.
[Speaker changes.] Ms. McGraw????????
[Speaker changes.] This bill only applies to county municipalities or
other special districts that have authority so it's only local elections
that would be statewide or non-congressional.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman...
[Speaker changes.] It does not apply to statewide or congressional
races.  Is that what you're sayin?
[Speaker changes.] That's correct.
[Speaker changes.] Are there....</p>

Gentleman will stand. Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question and say in favor of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to ask a question and speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m in favor of the bill. The question is this. Could you set up, set a
special election at the May 2014 Primary Election?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I believe you can. I’m going to ask staff to confirm that, but
I believe we do have that on there on an even year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Even year. The regular primary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct. On page one, line 21. It’s general election or the same
time as the primary in an even numbered year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I say something else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman to stand to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Warren mentioned some really low turnout races. I remember one that
was set for I think it was a land transfer tax like the day before the
Labor Day holiday. I remember another on that was the 5th of January in
a blizzard. Of course, they didn’t know it was going to be a blizzard
when they set the election. They sure knew no one would show up for the
election. In other words, these weird dates are designed to manipulate
the voters so that only the select few will make the decision. I think
this is a great bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I haven’t gone through the whole bill, so it may
be an obvious thing. I think it’s an important question. Can a
municipality, that might be, just say they get elected on odd years in
October. My city council they get elected on odd years in October, but
they want to do a bond issue. They want to set it for the date of a
county election. Which would be the November of an even year. They don’t
want to wait two years. Can a municipality pick the county election date
for their bond issue and then conversely could the county pick a
municipality date for its issue? I’m asking that question because
sometimes you don’t want to wait two years. Do you see what I mean? I
just want to make sure, since there both going to be high turn out
elections, that a municipality could pick the county date and the county
could pick the municipality date if they’re on different cycles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Referral?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. It does not just restrict them, to just being if it’s a city,
within the city. If there’s another election occurring on that date,
they would be able to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion? Debate? If not, Rep. Avila has moved for a
favorable report for the proposed committee substitute for House Bill 11
unfavorable to the original bill. Is there further discussion or debate?
Seeing none. Those who favor the motion will please signify by saying
aye, those who are opposed will please signify by saying no. The opinion
of the chair. The ayes have it. The motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. Warren. At this time, the chair is going to yield the
chair to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair? Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you will, just one minute. Rep (??). Rep. Warren? Rep. Warren?Would
you hold on just one minute? Although, we’ve already given the bill a
favorable report. Rep. Richardson wanted to pose one more inquiry. Yes,
ma’am. You can state your…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry. I pressed the button before the vote was taken. I didn’t know
I was going to… My question is concerning page two under sections
69-251. Are you saying the voters can petition to have a special
election even though you’re saying special election will be held on a
particular date? Page 2, line 38, section…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I’m going to ask staff to clarify on that. The bill itself.
I’m going to say, the bill itself, does allow for exceptions for any
issue that’s public safety. I’m not sure that would fall under that
category. I’ll refer to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Roll.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 6 actually deals with special taxes for rural fire protection
districts. The current law allows that petition procedure. The only
change would be that they would be that they would have to follow these
special election…</p>
