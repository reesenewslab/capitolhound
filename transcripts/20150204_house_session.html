  The House will come to order. Members will take their seats. Visitors
will retire from the chamber. The sergeant in arms will close the doors.
Members and visitors are asked to please silence all electronic devices.
The prayer today is gonna be offered by Representative Waddell. Members
and visitors in the gallery will please stand and remain standing for
the prayer as well as the pledge of allegiance. Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good evening. The prayer I offer tonight is from my pastor at Chadbourn
Baptist Church, Dr. Danny Russell. Please pray with me if you will. Oh,
God, we have gathered this evening with a lot of information before us
which will also increase in the upcoming weeks of session. We will
receive this information through our committee meetings and
conversations around the proposed bills before this governing body. We
have also gathered this evening with a lot of knowledge before us. We
come before the people of North Carolina from a variety of backgrounds
that influence how we view and understand the world in which we live. We
pray that this information and knowledge will lead us in governing with
true wisdom throughout this year&#39;s session. We ask for our thoughts
and perspectives to reflect your wisdom. We ask for the ability to
reason in a way that affirms a common approach and value to life. We ask
because some of us have faith, while some of us may not. We ask because
some of us have religious convictions, while some of us may not. Despite
these differences, may our common desire to care for and represent the
people of North Carolina bring us to reason together and make wise
decisions that reflect the power and grace and love to overcome the
differences that can so easily separate us. May we discover the gift of
love around us and become more loving. May we discover the gift of grace
around us and become more gracious. May we also discover what it really
means to partner together through love and grace for the sake of the men
and women throughout the great state of North Carolina and beyond. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to
the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

stand adjourned. What will take place in the meantime is after the

so we can start bringing the folks in from across the hall. Those in
favor of the motion will say “aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER

House will be at recess or stand at ease until 6:25 pm. [SPEAKER
