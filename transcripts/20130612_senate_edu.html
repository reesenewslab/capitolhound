alright......moving into the first agenda item. we'll be hearing the
child nutrition program sovency and support. do i have a motion for
adoption of the PCS. alright......
[speaker changes] Thank you ms. chairman, and members of the committee.
the committee substitute just made some conforming new changes, with the
original house version and the senate version that companion in the
senate is serial 193. and the original purpose of both bills are
essentually are identical and they differences were not material. this
pervision came from the pro evaluation division and they studied how
local education athorities assists direct and indirect cost to their
individual nutrition program. and after the study was complete there
were some findings and on adverage schools lost money on each school
meal, and were generating money to cover those cost by selling less
nutritious items. but with all of that said fifty two of the hundred and
fifteen programs state wide operated at a lost, but sixty seven of the
hundred and fifteen programs did not have the one month's operating
balance that the department of public instructions is required by
policy. thirty of the sixty seven programs did not have the one month's
balance that charge indirect cost by there local education atthurities
inspite of the DPI policy.  so this provision simply requires that each
local LEA must have atleast one month's operating revenue in that fund
and i would ask for your support ms chairman and members of the
committee.
[speaker changes] yes we have a motion for favorable report to the PCS
unfavorable to the original by senator tillman. all those in favor say

Moor-head school for the blind From the department of health and human
resources To the department of public Instructions Effective June 1,
2011 So now we're China makes them from forming changes And repeal some
unnecessary statures,Due to this change and want your support for this
bill this bill establishes That the state board of education is a
primary governing the agency for the three residential schools involved.
The board of education would be required to adopt rules as well To
comply with this change and implement the stature here. There'll be a
certain admission criteria-ls that they would have to use And finally
there will be a study by DTI To develop recommendations on education
options for children in residential Schools And the finances and
recommendations will be Acquired in the reported back to the Joint
legislative education Oversight committee And prior to the rules being
finalized They have to provide a draft rules To the same committee This
wall occur before January 1 of 2014 And it's been a bipartisan effort
And we've enjoyed it working together We put the children first and
foremost speaker: Thank you Senator Bryan is recognized for question.
I've been contacted by DTI That there was some provision that they were
interested in Did you all agree to that or is that something Or is that
in here about the APA change Yea the administrator procedure is that in
here That's still in here that's not exempt My understanding is that the
senate would not hear the bill If the bill was not exempt. Thank you
just wanted to know the status. Speaker: Any other questions? Senator
Pete: Thank you Mr. Chair There's certainly some know that we can
Consider but I do have a question If it reaches outside the parameter of
this bill but There've been some well the house The proposal on that
pitch property I believe also involves the Moor-head school's Fashion
Does This have to do with anything about this bill Or would that bill
influence What your bill has to do with Moor-head school. Thank you for
the questions Senator Pete that's a very good question That will not
affect this Bill at all Any other questions from a committee That chair
