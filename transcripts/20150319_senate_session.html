…See update which was tied in with Senate Bill 20, this is a very urgent
matter to get these tax changes approved by the General Assembly, this
is our vehicles who accomplish that again on those IOC updates we have
discussed them in Finance Committee meetings and in on the Senator floor
we have approved both of these bills, they are together so that we can
expedite this and have this change approve so that we can our obligation
as far as the IRC. I urge that you support this bill so we can move it
forward on the way to the House. I will stand for any questions Mr.
President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any discussion or debate? Senator Stein for what purpose you raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President to send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein is recognized to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate, North Carolina is one
of the house for closure rates in the country, we are right number 14
currently. Charlotte interestingly is number 35 out of more than 200 is
in the nation, we are clearly coming out of the recession, things were
getting better but we are still dealing with the after shocks of the
great recession, housing values and many communities are underwater
meaning that the person owes substantially more and what the house is
worth. The United States Congress, Republicans, and Democrats have
concluded for this year, this tax year 2015 for home owners who get debt
forgiveness, principle relief from their mortgage lender that they won’t
have to pay taxes on that money. Attorneys General across the country,
Republican and Democrat are like had written the Congress urging them to
extend that policy for this one more year. North Carolinians we all know
from this Federal provision last year making us one of just a handful
states, 43 states, Republican govern states, Democrat govern states
recognized that there are middle-class families who are struggling and
need a little help, the way it works is you owe substantially more  on
your home than it’s worth. The mortgage lender realizes that you are
facing foreclosure, foreclosure is the worst outcome for the owner of
the, no the investor and it’s a table outcome for the home owner because
then they have a foreclosure on the credit and it’s terrible for the
community, the neighborhood that house is in, it can dramatically affect
the housing values for all the people in that neighborhood. So what
lenders do in their own investor’s interest is they renegotiate, they
either do one of two things, they will reduce principle by modifying the
loans so you owe less money on it, or they will agree to a short sale
where you agree to sell your home for less money than it’s worth but
they are right off that debt so they don’t come after for you the extra
amount. It’s on average about $60,000 per family that’s what the
principle relief comes to. 4,000 middle-class families in North
Carolina, if we decouple from the Federal Government will have to come
up with tax liability on $60,000 of income, it’s about $3,500 per family
but here is the reality they don’t have that income, it’s paper, it’s
just a number, a digit, and an accounting change. They never got that
money so what are we gonna do to these 4,000 middle-class families? We
are gonna suck them with tax liability when they don’t have the income
such that if they had renegotiated the terms, modify their loan, they
now actually may get pushed into foreclosure because they can’t pay the
new note or when they have sold it through a short sale they have this
liability they can’t pay. So now, what we have done is create tax sheets
of middle-class families and then the Department of Revenue is obligated
to try to collect that money, they are gone still wages, why are we
doing this to struggling middle-class, working-class families in North
Carolina? We don’t have to do it, the large majority of states governed
by Republicans in this nation are doing it, and the United States
Congress majority control by Republicans is not doing it, why are we
setting ourselves apart and our hostility to the play of working folks?
This amendment does one very simple thing it just takes out the
reference to the principle relief that you do not have…

  ...for they attended for many years. She served our Forsyth County
Republican Party, as our women&#39;s president for a number of years.
She exemplified the ideal of public service and she devoted her life to
making positive contributions to our community and our state and our
nation.
Now Harry, her husband, he was a Senator, who gave much of his time and
energy to serving the public and he rose in this body, to serve as
Minority Leader. He served four terms here in the Senate.
Prior to arriving here, he served in the United States Army and the
Reserves, obtaining the rank of 1st Lieutenant.He served as a successful
businessman and through his work with his church and many boards and
commissions and fraternal organizations.
Sadly, Harry passed away this past December. Anne, a number of years
before. His legacy, like that of his wife, will be one of diligent
service to the State of North Carolina. Thank you, for granting me the
opportunity to share about my dear friends, Harry and Anne Bagnal. Thank
you Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator Krawieck and upon the motion of Senator Krawieck, of
Forsyth County, the chair is happy to extend courtesies of the gallery,
to Mary Comer, the daughter of Senators Harry and Anne Bagnal and
William Comer, who is the grandson, who is with us as a page this week.
William, will you raise your hand, so everybody can identify you? Mary,
if you&#39;ll stand, as well, and please, be recognized? Thank you for

Senator Lowe, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
I wanted to change my vote to a no.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Lowe changes his previous vote to no and that final count

Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Amendment of personal privilege.
[Speaker Change]
You have the floor for amendment of personal privilege.
[Speaker Change]
Sometimes, when you think about veterans, you think about, maybe,
somebody that&#39;s older, that has served. That&#39;s just kind of
where our mind goes. I just want to let you know, today, that my ally
Karen Johns has her son here today, Christopher Matthews.
Christopher served in Japan, during the earthquake and tsunami, won a
humanitarian award. I believe he was in the Air Force, a load master on
C-130 for six years. You know, veterans come in all ages.
I just thought it would be great for us to recognize Christopher.
He&#39;s in the gallery with us today and I really do appreciate your
service, Christopher and all veterans. Thank you very much.
[Speaker Change]
Christopher, won&#39;t you stand, so that we can recognize you. Thanks
for joining us today.
[Applause]

subject to the standard stipulations set forth in Senate rule 24.1,
