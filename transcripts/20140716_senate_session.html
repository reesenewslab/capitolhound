[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 1145: Insurance &amp; Registration Required for Mopeds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members we have had a spirited debate on
this bill over the last week or last and over the last five or six years
before. So, I bring it before you again, currently in North Carolina
mopeds are not registered and are not insured. This bill is to take care
of both of those points to now put a registration requirement on mopeds
and additionally make them have financial responsibility so when we
share the votes there is protected his wheel, there are many reasons to
do this, there have been numerous reports done about the safety of
mopeds, one study examine 373 crashes involving 368 people of these
incidents, 184 were involved under the influence of drugs and alcohol,
14 incidents resulted in death, 29 permanent disabilities, numerous
unknown property values that were head to be paid for by the uninsured
motorist portions of people’s insurance policy. I look forward to a nice
debate and moving forward on this bill for the future I think is so
orderly needed, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate, Senator McKissick what purpose you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanna thanks Senator Apodaca for his work on this bill, we certainly
need some reasonable regulations in place as it relates to use of mopeds
here in North Carolina but certainly if we continue dealing with the
registration of mopeds it makes a lot of sense to me, there is certainly
a capacity for our state to go out there and to perform that act that it
looks like they do have serial numbers and some of these have not they
can be inspected but the thing we need to remember though are those that
are using mopeds, are those that are frequently unable to get a car,
they either can’t go out there and purchase a car or they may not have a
drivers license which is valid because their drivers license has been
revoke for one reason or another. So, I think we need to be mindful of
the fact that it provides viable transportation to and from work
frequently to other destinations with people who do not have another
viable mean to transportation. Sometimes people say, “Why do they can’t
take public transit?” Well, there are a whole lot of parts of the state
they are not covered by mass transit system or public transportation.
So, we need to be sensitive to that but the provision of the bill that
does…

<p id="10:00">
[0:00:00.0]
…Some concerns and I think deserves further study, it’s the provision in
the bill right now that requires insurance. I try to go back and check a
little bit to try to see where the insurance have been provided today in
our neighboring states and interestingly enough and this is one I think
insurance provision deserves a little bit more study. In Florida, there
is no requirement for insurance of mopeds, Georgia no requirement for
insurance, South Carolina no requirement for insurance, Tennessee no
requirement for insurance, Virginia none, no in West Virginia. I think
that suggest to us that we are about to embark up on a process which is
not the norm in other states but they do have some provisions dealing
with the use and regulation of mopeds it is for that reason that I sent
forward an amendment for the bodies consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that we could benefit from a some additional investigations to
see the extent in which insurance should be required here in North
Carolina, it looks right now based upon information is available through
the Department of Insurance studies and policies could cost about $400 a
year and we don’t know really what they are gonna cost because we don’t
have any companies out there today operating within an environment for a
type of caring said would be required now is actually routinely
available. So, what this would do is to sent to a study group the duty
of going back and doing some work as the study group is gonna be
composed of house members and Senate members to give some thoughtful
inquiry and to how insurance should be structured here in North Carolina
of whether we might want to go over the trend the way other states have
in the South-East of not requiring it. So, I would hope that we would do
our appropriate do-delectates and think about this before we impose an
additional cost upon many people in the state who can at leas afford it.
So, I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment 1? Senator Apodaca…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the original debate we had on this I’m trying to remember was it
2009 perhaps yeah Senate Jack is here, Senator Ryan was here, we
discussed this and we had spirited debate and it’s one of the only bills
Senate Jenkins I remember ever failing on the Senate floor. But since
that time, since that time accidents have been steadily climbing, we
have 439, 2009 we have 455, 2010 we have 501 these are reported crashes,
fatalities away 15 fatalities 097, 2010 was 13, I don’t have the 11 and
12 figures here the latest ones but it did show a climb along the same
lines or the others. We can keep kicking this can down the road and we
can make those of us who approaches insurance and do what we are
supposed to with our vehicles keep paying the price for those who don’t.
Now, $400 a year for transportation insurance yes that’s a lot of money
but that is also a person who has no driver’s license, who has lost
their drivers license and has had numerous charges and offenses against.
The bottom line if someone hasn’t had violation against their license
and all it can start somewhere from $60 a year up to $400. So, there is
a range there can definitely be it’s all classified on year licenses and
your violations and offenses. So, I don’t think that’s a large price for
someone to pay, they will be driving 20 to 25 miles an hours in between
cars doing 55 miles an hour. I know up in my area we do not have
adequate public transportation. So, living with mopeds is a daily
occurrence and it’s very taxing many times because again we got behind
one last week with two cases the beer strapped on the back of it, headed
down the road doing 20 miles an hour and 50 miles an hour and it so
happens that never mind we will leave it, I ask you to vote against the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Send forward your amendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator McKissick has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
This is a pretty straight forward amendment. What it will essentially do
is allow the registration of mopeds to begin December 1. It's the date
designated in Senator Apodaca's bill. But what it does is if we're
moving this insurance route, at least it gives an additional year before
that additional cost is imposed upon individuals that perhaps can least
afford it. It also gives those dealers that have a whole stock of
inventory of mopeds, a chance to sell the inventory that's there,
because they may not be ordering the same amount based upon the pace of
sales that they anticipate as a result of the new law being passed.
And more importantly, it's a reasonable notice period for people to go
out there and understand the fact that they're going to be required to
register and get insurance for these vehicles. So it gives them up until
December, the law becomes effective when registration occurs, but it
would be December the following year before they'd be required to get
insurance. So it's more or less a phased process, a transition process,
which I think is more than reasonable. So I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].

I know it's way past 1984, but it sounds like we're revolving back. So
I'm just, I hate this bill, and Donnie's, God rest your soul. If he has
you. I read like cameras too. So I just put this in the same category
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Early discussion or debate? ?? What purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In respect for Donnie. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
have the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not saying in
respect to Tom Apocada. I said in respect to Donnie, I'm going to vote
against this bill. I hope everybody else votes for it though. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President.
Squarely on the fence. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just for clarification, it will read
the license plate. Senator Tillman, it will not read in the car when
you're going down with somebody sitting beside you in your arm around.
They will not be able to see that. So don't worry about things like
that. I really do want to do this for the police. We need criminals off
the road and don't think it's not a problem. It's a big big problem in
my district. And let's give authorities out there a little more coverage
so that they can get bad people off the street. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Jenkins, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gandi, you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Gandi, there's nothing in this bill that would
authorize the law enforcement agencies to mail a copy of that license
tag to your wife, or anybody that... [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll tell you
what we will do, is if you find that to be the case, and you're
specific, I will personally take care of it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Dutacov, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill and to ask
Senator Gunn a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You want to do the question
first or you want to speak? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I'll just do a
question and not speak on the bill, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Gandi, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will these cameras take pictures of you if you're on a
moped and verify your insurance? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I really have no response. Speechless. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apocada. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak second time on the bill, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It will not now, but hopefully after
December 1st, it will. Senator Tucker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion or debate? Senator Goulsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaking on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I do have concerns, as stated by
Senator Apocada similar to his. We have technology now. We have gunshot
detectors on our streets that are able to tell where gunshots are from
and monitor what's going on on our streets. We have tons of video
cameras all across our state that monitor our highways. So even though
this license plate reader might not be able to tell who's in the car,
who's driving it, or who's with you. Of course we have cameras and more
and more surveillance in our state going up everyday. So far, our state
has banned the use of drones at this point. But of course that's another
technology that law enforcement has.
I would remind the members that crime in our state is actually down 50%
since 1974 for the last several decades. We don't have a crime epidemic,
even though the news papers might scream about that. I don't think that
we need monitoring of our highways by DOT. It is just a small leap for
that monitoring of those tags to be able to allow companies to then mail
out information and more problems. Will also, I see a number that I've
been given by Senator Apocada. 1994, we've seen actually violent crime
go down since then, 50%. Overall, crime rate down 50% since 1974. We
don't have a crime issue in our state. We do have problems, but they're
nothing like they used to be.
I oppose this bill. I oppose government surveillance and government
monitoring. This is just one more step along the road that we do not
need to go down. And I'll be voting against it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Oh. Senator Bryant, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I just wanted to let the members know that I'll be objecting to
thorough reading so we can look at some kind of provision for spousal
protection in tihs bill by tomorrow. I'm just joking, but. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Heist. What purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the bill. You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members of the Senate. I guess
sometimes it's just best when you don't know what you don't know. I...</p>

<p id="35:00">
I served as mayor in the town of Spruce Pine before coming here to the
General Assembly. I had a constituent come to me with a pretty serious
problem we worked with the police on, someone kept breaking in to his
tire shop. Something that ?? happened on multiple occasions. So we, with
the police department, set up cameras on the road back and forth until
their shop got broken in again and fortunately discovered that only one
license plate had come down the street during the time when from they
closed to when we knew the break-in had occurred. We caught someone who
had broken into multiple businesses in the town by having their license
plate and looking at that and recording it from a public right of way. I
guess it's just good we didn't know we couldn't place it there. We just
did it. It was going and we didn't get permission from it, maybe that's
how we do things a little more frequently in mountain communities coming
forward. But that being said, though, I would like to ask Senator Gunn a
question.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Gunn, do you yield?[SPEAKER CHANGES]I
yield.[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Gunn, could
you give me a sense of currently where these cameras can and can't be
placed and under this bill where and where not these cameras may be able
to be placed?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Senator Hize. It is currently
permitted on city streets and not state right of ways so these cameras
are there now being used for these very same purposes. I would like to,
and of course now this will be any right of ways that the state has, but
one thing I do like that I do want you to be aware of is right now there
are no restrictions in place for these readers and because of two
amendments now that we do have restrictions on these license plate
readers where we did not have those before with the city streets and I
think that is a real positive.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Any further discussion or
debate?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Berring,
for what purpose do you rise?[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the
bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]You have the floor.[SPEAKER CHANGES]I guess most
of you know that what I do as a part time legislator and my full time
job is being in the classroom, and just recently we discussed privacy in
the classroom and one of the things that I taught the students and we
discussed is that in the United States, we do have the right of privacy,
but the question becomes do we have a reasonable expectation of that
privacy? Now I abhor government intrusion into our lives and
intervention. I am a very private person and I was standing what I'm
doing now. However, I do not think, and the reason I'm going to be
supporting Senator Gunn with this bill was I don't think we have a
reasonable expectation of privacy when we're on a public street and for
that reason I will be voting for the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator
McKissey, for what purpose do you rise?[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the
bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]You have the floor.[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think the
last remarks made by Senator Gunn about the state and the law today made
in my mind the most compelling reason to vote for this bill. Right now,
these license plate readers are out there. They're all over the state of
North Carolina, particularly in urban areas, without any regulations
whatsoever in terms of what that data is that's captured, how that data
can be used, whether there are policies by these police departments or
law enforcement agencies relating to that data and how long the data can
be retained. Now, the amendment which I ran basically covers not just
new readers that would go into state right of ways, but would cover all
the readers that exist today. And for some reason, this was defeated and
there will continue to be no use or regulations of readers already in
place today. We need those regulations and to address Senator Bryant's
question about the use in civil matters, that same amendment basically
says you can't go out there and use it in civil matters unless you
happen to be the person whose license plate somebody captured by the
result of using one of these readers and criminal charges were brought
up against you. If there was an abuse of process, that person can use
that data and get to it. Nobody else can get there. If you want to get
out there and you're disgruntled about what a spouse has done, you can't
get a lawyer or somebody to go out there and just start subpoenaing this
data. It avoids those abuses. If it were defeated, for some reason, the
bill that we have here, this state of law in North Carolina would be
non-existent. Non-existent. We need reasonable use. We need reasonable
restrictions. We need reasonable parameters to govern how they are to be
used and for that reason, I'm gonna support the bill, because I think it
establishes those reasonable parameters. If it was not doing so, I could
not. But I think we've gotta come up with a system that works and
functions</p>

<p id="40:00">
And give it some time, and see what happens. If we need to come back and
revisit this, a second from now, we can always do it, but to leave it
out there today, where there are no regulations whatsoever, I think is
the worst possible outcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister president?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just wanted to speak a second time on the bill, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to address Senator Hise's concern. Senator Hise, I understand
your concern about being able to use technologies when you have specific
threats or specific issues, and in a case like you gave us in your own
hometown of Spruce Pine, putting a video camera out to monitor a
particular area makes a lot of sense to me. I don't have any opposition
to that whatsoever. I'm concerned about continual growth of government
intrusion with new technologies, whether it's video cameras, whether
it's audio, whether it's these license plate readers, and I'm just
concerned that as we continue to go down that road with these tools that
law enforcement must have when we don't have a crime issue in our state
is just a wrong way to go down. The issue that you described to the
Senate is one that would require that kind of technology, I would not be
opposed to, but to spread it across the board and to tell me that when
I'm operating legally on a road that I paid for as a citizen, I'm gonna
be monitored by some nameless, faceless government bureaucrat to see
where I am, where I'm going, monitor my whole trip. We've had issues
down in Wilmington with that new technology, the Sting Ray that's been
used to basically fake a cell tower so that law enforcement can
allegedly find certain people, and I've had a lot of questions about
that. I just continue to be concerned as someone who cares about our
civil rights and someone who fights in the justice system all the time
about the continued growth of government intrusion and I'll be opposing
the bill. Thank you, mister president.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister president?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I, I'm very concerned usually about the abuse of
power and the intrusion of government too, so I find myself at a strange
point, but I say that I'm supporting this because even recently, my
police chief called and indicated in a recent situation in Guilford
county, had this technology been available, at a ride away, it would
have been possible to track down the individual who had committed the
crime, and I was aware of that situation. And so I could see the
reasoning behind that, I am concerned about continually using technology
when I think it's not necessary and abusing power in terms of following
people and that kind of thing too. So I'm concerned and I'm kind of in
between, but I'm going to support it, because I am aware of a situation,
and there are probably some others where the individuals were, who had
committed the offenses could have been tracked down and brought into
custody had this been available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister president.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister president. I share.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I share Senator Goolsby's sentiments almost exactly. But one
of the things I would like to point out about this bill, and quite
frankly it's gonna reiterate what Senator McKissick has said, and
because of Senator McKissick's amendment, I think we need to support it,
and I'll tell you why. Currently, based on the information I've given,
been given, the Durham County tax administrator has license plate
readers. In my opinion that supports Senator Goolsby's argument. On the
other hand, if we shoot down this bill with Senator McKissick's
amendment, basically you are going to let them operate unregulated,
unlicensed, unregulated by the state with no privacy protections for
people. Currently they keep the information up to one year. The
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department keeps theirs for eighteen
months, many others keep theirs for undesignated times, and so I think
that we do need to be mindful. I think that Senator McKissick's
amendment to this bill puts in needed privacy protections for, quite
frankly, what is an unregulated system of surveillance in the state
right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate. Hearing on question for the Senate is the
passage for Senate Bill reading of House bill 348. All in favor will
vote aye. All opposing will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed.</p>
