…House Bill 193, Expand use for Mecklenburg County Charlotte Local
Taxes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate. This is a local bill
and let me assure you what it does is it requested by the City of
Charlotte to allow them to have some flexibility on existing food and
beverage tax revenues of 1%. And all it does is it provides – it gives
them the flexibility to use that money for the use of the Bank of
America Stadium property and for amateur sports. And I'll tell everybody
in the Senate that there is no new taxes, no new revenues, no impact at
all on the state revenue stream and I urge you to support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Graham, for what
purpose you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Graham, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I too would like to encourage the members of the Senate to vote for this
local legislation. It’s a bipartisan effort. They came from the House
where both parties have studied the issue and wants to support the City
of Charlotte. As I said earlier in this chamber that sports and
entertainment is the major part of North Carolina economy and those
local urban areas are working towards making sure that that’s a good
effort across North Carolina. So certainly we urge your support for this
local bill for the City of Charlotte. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to ask a question of not the bill sponsor, but of a Senate Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Graham, do you yield for question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Graham, since you stated that this was a bipartisan effort, are
we hearing the Senate to assume that the local delegation from
Mecklenburg County are all in agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In reference to the Mecklenburg delegation certainly I can speak for
myself and the two members who have signed on to this bill as
co-sponsors coming from the House. The local delegation took no position
official other than hearing the information coming from the City of
Charlotte, but certainly we support the Carolina Panthers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To move under rule 29 that I will be recused from voting on this bill, I
have sent forward to the clerk a statement of my reasons for the excuse.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other discussion or debate? Hearing none. The question for the
Senate is the passage of the Committee Substitute to House Bill 193 on

Moving on the public bills, second reading, Senate Bill 98, clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 98, Require Pulse Oximetry Newborn Screening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Brock is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. President. Senate Bill 98 will require the Pulse Oximetry
in Newborn Screenings and it will detect congenital heart defects and
directs the public – Commission for Public Health to adopt temporary and
permanent rules to include Pulse Oximetry Screening in newborn, in the
newborn screening program that we have at our hospitals. Over half of
our hospitals use this already, it’s a newer technology. The physical
impact, it is negligible. Looking at the cost of it, it’s a two-minute
procedure, as Senator Barefoot said yesterday in Committee, but looking
at the not only the cost savings, but life savings of this bill and now
to help our children of our state. One great example we had yesterday in
committee, was Grace for ?? was there, who is now seven years old that
wasn’t called, but her surgery that she had when she was 18 days old,
cost over $200,000. So hopefully with this test we can detect these
problems early to make sure that we take care of our babies. I urge your
support.

<p id="15:00">
It was so wonderful yesterday to see ?? in committee and being seven
years old and having survived, not having this test but having the
surgery to do so. A family in my area though, on the flip side, ?? the
severity of this. Sean and Emily ?? daughter was born and did not have
this test done. The little girl Sarah lived about thirty six hours.
So the severity of not doing this and the lives that could be saved, I
know everybody is on board with this but it's very real to infant
children and I urge your support for the bill. Greg Olson, also too,
tight end for the Carolina Panthers, since we mentioned the Carolina
Panthers earlier; son had experienced the same thing happening and did
not have the test and it is my understanding Greg's son has had three
surgeries so far and doing well. So, ladies and gentlemen of the senate,
this is something we can do that would be painless and just impact very
little any kind of physical responsibility to the hospital so I urge
your support for the bill. Thank you.

Mister president.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In my haste to get this bill passed, I forgot to send forth an
amendment.

Senator Brock moves to amend the bill.

Senator Brock is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister president. This is technically a technical amendment.
It changes the part of tele-medicine which in the bill was a live two
way process and some of the technology with it; kind of a real world
experience. Instead of being a live two way chat, this would be more of
an email where you send and retrieval of the information; and the
amendment is purely a technical one.

one. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 470. No beer, wine, if permit revoked or suspended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister president. This is a very narrow scope bill. It only
applies to business that have had their AVC permits revoked or
suspended. And what it does, is that they are having a problem locally
in Greensboro that a week after those licenses are suspended or revoked
they re-open brown bagging and allowing patrons to come in and enjoy the
festivities in the club and brown bag. And all this does is prevent
brown bagging while their license is suspended or revoked. During
committee we have a couple of concerns come up and I have a technical
amendment I would like to put forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do the members have a copy, senator?

Yes they do.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We had a discussion and at the time we were a little bit concerned if
the owner was leasing his property, it might affect the owner with his
ability to re-lease his property one that tenant had moved and he would
not be able to brown bag or have a business come on and do that and I
think this takes care of that. And I would ask for your support.

[speaker changes]
Senator Rabon is recognized to explain the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. President. Currently, the statutes for these license
plates, the three agencies read Charlotte, Raleigh, and Fort Bragg. What
this bill does is it changes those three words to Mecklenburg county,
Wake County and Cumberland County.  It simply cleans this up so if these
plate agencies move out of the city or out of those  specific spots,
then they're still in the county and covered by the bill. Very simple
and it's very forward. Thank you very much.

Any further discussion or debate? Senator Brown, for what purpose do you
rise?
[speaker changes]
To ask the bill's sponsor a question.

Senator Rabon, do you yield for a question?

Senator Rabon, I'm sorry, I hadn't had the chance to study this. On the
tag agents, right now, it's my understanding Fayetteville has one on the
base. Is this saying that the state runs basically - is this saying that
the state can expand that?
[speaker changes]
That is correct. There may be a problem with that one on the base
because with military and they may have to move it off the base and that
would then be in Cumberland county rather than in Fort Bragg.
[speaker changes]
And the state would continue to run that agency?

Yes--

is what you're saying?

Yes. Yes they would. Just as is.

[speaker changes]
Senator Harrington is recognized to explain the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. President. Let me start by saying this is an agency bill
and we do need to make these changes in the long session in order to
continue receiving some federal funding that we are getting. I'll be as
brief as I can to give you some details. Section 1 of the bill addresses
open container requirements.  Current North Carolina law is not in
compliance with federal law and because of this, federal highway system
has redirected 5% o fiscal year funds into alcohol impaired driving
programs. The redirected money totals about 8 million dollars currently
and will go up to 10 million in the fiscal year 2014. This money is
needed for roads and this has to be done in the long session. To comply,
North Carolina must prohibit the possession of any open alcoholic
container in the passenger area of any motor vehicle located on a public
highway or right of way of a public highway. Under North Carolina, the
open container requirements apply only to</p>

if a vehicle is required to be registered. This means that mopeds are
exempted in North Carolina as not in compliance. This bill will correct
that. Federal agencies have determined that North Carolina's repeat
intoxicated driver law does not comply with the impoundment,
immobilization or interlock installation and mandatory minimum sentence
requirement. To comply, State law must require the impoundment,
immobilization or interlocking of each vehicle owned, operated or owned
and operated by a repeat intoxicated offender. To comply with mandatory
minimums to repeat offender, State law must provide for a mandatory
minimum sentence of not less than five days imprisonment or thirty days
of community service for second offenders, and not less than ten days of
imprisonment or sixty days community service for third or subsequent
offenders. This bill will eliminate these exceptions in North Carolina
law that cause us not to be in compliance with federal law, and allow us
to continue receiving these federal funds. I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Newton, permission to rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Harrington will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator to yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll try, but if it's technical, I might pass it over
to Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Harrington. I just want to make
sure I understood the first part of what you explained: the federal
requirements about open containers: Are you saying that the federal
requirements would mean that in North Carolina, if my wife and I and
another couple want to ride down to Williamston Sunny Side Oyster Bar
and have somebody drive us down there, that I can't have a cocktail or a
beer in the car on the way? Is that what this change will mean?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. Currently, there's a sort of loophole in the law
that allows open containers on mopeds. This just closes that loophole.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On mopeds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, you have permission to rise.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Harrington, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, I just want to make it clear, if Senator
Newton and his wife and another couple go ride piggyback on a motorped,
that is their business, this would not involve a typical charter bus and
that kind of thing. Is that correct?
