The Government Committee come to order please. Members take your seats.
Spectators please turn off cell phones or any other electronic devices.
Take your seats. Now welcome to the Government Committee. Today, our
pages are Lexi All, or All, from Johnson County, sponsored by Speaker
Tillis. Where you at? Back there. And Kianna Cooper from Guilford
County. Back there as well, welcome. And Kalee Ritasik. Hi Kalee, how
are you? From Wake County, sponsored by Representative Dollar. And
Adrian Steele from Wake County, sponsored by Representative Holley.
Welcome and thank you ladies for your service here today. Our sergeant
of arms are ??, Doug Harris and Garland Shepherd. Gentlemen, we thank
you for service today. Our staff today, Erica Churchill, Guiles Perry,
Shelly DiAttern, Kelly Quick and Shara Graham and Susan Phillips.
Our first bill on the agenda today, ladies and gentlemen, is House Bill
314. Representative Martin to take the podium. [Pause] It’s House Bill
314. [Pause] You don’t have them?
[Speaker Changes]
Is that the bill?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes, go right ahead. It’s yours.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you. Members of the Committee, this is a fairly straightforward
bill. The town of Ayden is asking to change their change their charters.
They did have a resolution that was signed by the mayor and all of the
council folks. They have been working on this for a number of years.
They had some public hearings and they were able to have 100% support to
change from a two years term for the mayors and commissioners, moving to
a four year staggered term. And the way that we will implement this is
starting with the next election, in 2013, certain seats will run for two
years and certain seats will run for four years. And at the end of the
two years, the remaining people who had run on two years would then move
to a four year term. So in 2015, then everyone would be running for a
four year term, but it would be staggered so that they wouldn’t have a
full turnover at one time. That is the objective of the bill. There’s a
companion filed in the Senate. It has received good support from the
citizens. I made sure it went out… excuse me? It went out in the paper.
If there were any public comments to come back, that we did receive
that.
I will give one correction. On the bill summary it says that they
currently have staggered terms, and that may be what they found when
they looked at the charter, but that is not what is happening in
practice. In practice in the town, it’s everyone runs at the same time
for a two year term.  So we have just discovered this discrepancy this
morning and have gone back to the town to see, are they actually not
following the charter or is there something they’ve done? But I don’t
think it is really relevant to the passage of this, because we’re
talking about changing it and looking at how we go forward. So in
practice today, they’re all on a two year term, they will come up for
election in 2013 and this legislation will take effect then, moving
forward. I’m happy to answer any questions, but I would urge your
support of this vote and my community would be very appreciative.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Representative Martin. Members, are there any questions for
the Representative? Representative Fisher.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I came in just a little bit late, but I wanted
to ask the bill’s sponsor a question. This is, of course, a local bill
and I’m wondering if your delegation is all on board with this local
bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes, thank you that question and the delegation is all on board.
Representative Brian Brown has signed on. There is a companion in the
Senate with Senators Dawn Davis and Lewis Pate for the same bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Members do we have any other questions? Representative Langdon. You’re
recognized for a motion sir.
[Speaker Changes]
I move for a favorable report on House Bill 314.
[Speaker Changes]
??
[Speaker Changes]
It referred to…
[Speaker Changes]
That’s fine.
[Speaker Changes]
It doesn’t go anywhere else, does it?
[Speaker Changes]
No, sir.
[Speaker Changes]
Okay.
[Speaker Changes]
We have a motion on the floor for a favorable report for House Bill 314.
All in Favor say aye.
[Speaker Changes]
Aye [Multiple]
[Speaker Changes]
All opposed say no. The Ayes have it. Thank you, Representative Martin.

<p id="05:00">
Our next Bill is Senate Bill 56 presented by Senator Jackson, or
disguised as Representative Jimmy Dixon. You have the floor Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chair. This is a Bill coming from the
Senate with Senator Jackson. This simply makes an amendment to
legislation that was passed in the last session. It is an agreeable
annexation. Briefly what it is, in the town of Wallace, there's a
subdivision a few miles outside of town that's been a perfect example of
private/public cooperation. The private folks would like to annex
property as it is developed. The town of Wallace has agreed to that and
deleting this section too will accomplish that so as these properties
come online, it will give the opportunity for voluntary annexation to
take place between the town of Wallace and this subdivision. There is no
opposition that I know of, to it. I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Members, do we have any questions for Representative
Dixon? Seeing none. Representative ?? is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I'd like to make motion that we give a favorable
report to Senate Bill 56.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Members, we have a motion on the floor for a
favorable report for Senate Bill 56 with a referral to Finance. All in
favor please signify by saying Aye. All opposed No. The Ayes have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you members of the
Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Representative Dixon. Members, we're going
to pull from the, near the end of the agenda and go to the PCS for House
Bill 276. So, if you look toward the back of your packet, because your
Bills should be in order. House Bill 276, being presented by
Representative Stam. We have a motion on the floor from Representative
Collins, through the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: [UNINTELLIGIBLE] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Those will be distributed to you soon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative, you can probably proceed at this
point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I'm sorry. Chairman	, I ask your support for House
Bill 276. House Bill 276 will do several things. It will modernize and
simplify language of the statute that was created in 1923. Now this, we
have been living with this since 1923. It hadn't been revised at all and
I can tell you after having served thirty years as a kind of
Commissioner, we have these issues to come up all the time. We need a
clear way in order to get them resolved. It will create more logical
organization and add sub-headings. It will update the Statute to
incorporate modern case law and practices. It will reduce the threshold
for certain decisions from super majority to a simple majority. It makes
appeal of government decisions easier for the ordinary citizen. I ask
you and ask your support for this Bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I also ask for your support. Representative Graham
had thirty years experience dealing with it. In my approximately
twenty-five years as a town attorney or assistant to a town attorney, I
had no experience. Our Board of Adjustment met no times, zero, I think
once, in about twenty-five years. But in many places, they meet all the
time and the procedures widely vary, the interpretations</p>

<p id="10:00">
?? widely vary. And so, it's necessary to modernize this, so we would
have consistent rulings. I've asked the chair and our excellent staff,
if we could have permission for Tom Terrell?? to explain it. Because he
has led a task force for many, many months involving dozens of people.
He's sort of the expert in the field from the real estate section of the
bar. If that's okay, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be fine. Trivial. Approach the podium and
identify yourself. You have to put your little, there you go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm Tom Terrell?? attorney in
Cranesboro?? I think that representative Stam and Graham have been spot
on in their descriptions of what this field does. We believe it comes to
you today essentially without controversy. Because we have allowed
citizens all over the state of North Carolina to help us draft this
bill, every single one of you sitting here today has someone in your
county. Whether it's a zoning official, a city or a county attorney, a
attorney representing developers or somebody in your, in industry. We've
had a lot of industry input into this field. It went through about 20
different versions. We've listened to what people say and we
incorporated these into a bill that works.
A very brief background, if you don't know what a Board of Adjustment
is. It is a local government board that affects thousands of citizens in
the state every single year. These are citizens who take matters to them
that affect their business, their property and their family. The statute
was written in 1923. It was poorly written even then. And it was time
for us to take that statute and give it a good modern re-draft. So, that
we can keep up with the way things have changed in the state.
Our population has increased dramatically, The world is a lot more
complex. A ?? brush description would  say this, this bill is a lot more
citizen friendly. If a citizen wanted to challenge a decision by a
zoning official, the process now has been spelled out so that can more
easily be done. There are businesses who are trying to make millions of
dollars of investments in your various communities, who have to get
special or conditional use permits that are required now by a super
majority of four-fifths.
As professor Owens at the School of Government has spelled out for us,
that was only by an accident of history that we've been operating under
this artificially high threshold. We recommended that we do this by a
simple majority. It's much closer to the way we do things in this
country. We are making, we've taken a giant step toward uniformity of
this statute with all land use statutes. We are taking for the board's
purposes, for their benefit. We're explaining better how to do what are
called “quazogical??” proceedings.
And finally, many of you have heard about variances. We have clarified
and actually lowered a threshold that was never, ever in the statute. It
was added by a very activist court a few decades ago. And makes it
harder for citizens to get a very common sense exclusion from a zoning
ordinance that should not affect them. I'm glad to answer any questions,
but certainly we do ask your support.  There are people, I can tell you
right now. There are people in each of your counties who have signed off
of this. It's that, our support is that broad based.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, sir. Members, do we have any questions for
the bill sponsors or the, yes? Representative Fisher?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm wondering what other
organizations that lend support to cities or counties have you heard
from, in terms of their support or opposition to this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Burr??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  This bill is supported by the North Carolina
Association of County Commissioners and the legal municipalities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Zagis??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Comment on the bill. I've
had some contact from members of the real estate board, who are in full
support of this bill. Think it's a good bill and something long overdue
to handle the antiquated system that's in effect now. At an appropriate
time, I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, sir.  Representative Floyd.</p>

The gentlemen have already commented on my ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, thank you. Members, are there any other questions?
Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question. The bill I'm looking at says
a city. Does this include counties as well? Can we make it include
counties, because-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It does include counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good, because I've seen that at home with the ZBA not meeting once every
seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, are further questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could just point Representative Ford to page six, where it says the
provisions of the part about cities are applicable to counties. Page
six, line eighteen. Good question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, you're recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to make a motion that we have an
unfavorable report as to the original bill and a favorable report on the
proposed committee substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we have a motion by Representative Davis on the floor. All in
favor please say aye. Opposed, please signify by saying no. The ayes
have it, sir, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going back on
schedule to house bill 346 which also has PCS that Representative Elmore
has made a motion we accept, and this will be presented by someone
eventually. Representative Faircloth, there you are. You have the
microphone, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Committee, I appreciate your attention this
morning to this bill and request, and this arose out of a situation
where a local government council member had a judgement in favor of the
city and against him, and he refused to pay the judgement and moved
assets, apparently, so that there was no way for the city to collect on
the situation. At the same time, still sitting as a city council person
and drawing a salary for being in that position. A lot of citizens don't
think that's a proper situation. I don't think it is, and I don't think
you would think it is. What this bill does, what the PCS does, is simply
allows the city to have a way, or a county to have a way to collect that
judgement, legal judgement, in existence. The city has tried to collect,
has not been able to, the interest is running into thousands of dollars
and it's a situation that needs to be corrected. I appreciate your
support and I'd be glad to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any questions from the committee? Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to make a motion we give a favorable report to the
post-committee substitute for house bill 346, unfavorable to the
original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Referred ??. Alright, we have a motion on the floor. All in favor, say
aye. Any against? Thank you, the bill has passed. Next we have a house
bill 347.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen of the commitee, this is a
relatively simple bill. It is requested by the city of Greensboro and it
is supported by the entire Guilford Delegation. House bill 347 simply
allows the governing board of the Firefighter's Relief Fund of the city
to also serve as the governing board of the firefighter's supplemental
retirement system. So it would basically be the overseeing of that will
be done now, we're proposing that it be done by the Firefighter's Relief
Fund in the city of Greensboro. As far as we know, there is no
opposition to this bill. It also provides a change from the word
&quot;firemen&quot; to &quot;firefighters&quot;. We think that's
appropriate as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any questions from the committee? Representative Setzer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time, I'd like to make a motion for favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? It's the appropriate time, Representative Setzer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report to the proposed committee substitute to-
this is house bill number-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the same bill. 347.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
347. Unfavorable to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's going to have a ?? referral to state personnel in the finance.</p>

Thank you mister chair. Thank you members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next bill, House bill 200. Representative Brawley. Representative
Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. There is a PCS on this bill. I would ask that
it be before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins makes the motion, the PCS is before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. This is a public bill, but it is, acts like a
local bill. It is supported not only by both Democratic and Republican
members of the Mecklenburg delegation, but by both sides of the
Mecklenburg county commission, and was announced at a news conference,
which was hosted by the chair of the county commission and attended by
almost the entire body. Essentially what happened was in 2011, a
reevaluation was performed that did not do a particularly good job and
on investigation was found to have been in violation of North Carolina
law in several respects. In fact, a cynical man might say the only thing
they did right was send the bills out, and response to complaints, a
study was launched by an independent consultant who found that there
were several neighborhoods with major errors of as much as 40% deviation
in what the property should have been valued. It was also discovered
that field checking of data had not happened in 17 years. It's the
result of about five months of work. It's been vetted by school and
government department of revenue. I'd say it has support of the
Mecklenburg county commission. What we're essentially doing is trying to
get Mecklenburg county where they'd be if they lost a class action
lawsuit and have to do it anyway, saving expense to the taxpayers. We'd
be happy to ask any detailed questions that you may have. It does apply
definitely to Mecklenburg, it is optional for other counties but not
requiring them to do it. It's drafted in such a way that it does not
violate constitutional provisions about setting up separate classes of
taxpayers, and will be referred to finance after we're through here
today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, gentlemen of the committee, we've heard the bill. Any questions?
Representative Ford. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry, you say this does not apply to the other counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there are as many as 75 counties to whom it could apply if they
take some additional actions to meet all of the prerequisite, the terms
that are required, one of which is an independent survey of your last
reevaluation that shows there's significant deviations between actually
what it should be and the way it was performed. So far Mecklenburg's the
only county that has such independent evidence of a major breakdown in
reevaluation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. At the appropriate time I'd like to make a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions from the committee? Mr. Moore, it's the appropriate
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move that we receive a favorable report on the PCS, unfavorable on the
original with a referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's gonna go to regulatory reform, then finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To regulatory reform, then finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, we have a motion on the floor. All in favor say aye. Any opposed.
Thank you. Next on the agenda is House bill 370. Well, one second, we've
got to correct this summary we're passing out. All right, Representative
Graham, you have the floor. Sorry for the technical difficulty.</p>

Thank you very much. Seeking your support this morning for House Bill
370 and what House Bill 370 would do is shorten the review period when
you're trying to purchase or negotiate a state property. It will shorten
the time that you would make the request, that there will be an
investigation, and you will close out the process within about thirty
days. That's primarily what the Bill does. It is, what happens is often
times you'll working with state properties and you go through the
process of doing your advertising, your bidding, but you never can get
closure on it and this will force us to make those closes within a
reasonable time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Okay, you've heard the Bill. Any questions?
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chair. Just a question. What's the
timeframe now? How long does it take?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Sixty days. I'm sorry, right now there is no time
limit. It is open ended. Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Do you know if the delays been due to maybe a lack of
personnel?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I don't know but I think it's probably establishing a
set of priorities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Any other questions? Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Any other questions from the Committee?
Representative Collins, motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I move that we give a favorable report to House Bill
370, referred to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: All in favor say Aye. Any opposed? The Bill's passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: House Bill 354.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Good morning. Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the
Committee. This Bill will allow the county Commissioners from Buncombe
County and Madison County both to appoint a county Commissioner to
server on the AB Tech Community College Board. AB Tech serves two
counties, Buncombe and Madison counties. It is in response to a turn of
events that happened to be unfortunate but as it, this is an attempt to
correct that. Madison County Commissioner's in support of this, Buncombe
County, AB Tech. I appreciate Representative Presnell, Representative
Moffitt, and consulted with Representative Fisher and I don't think
there's any opposition to this Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you. Any questions from the Committee?
Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Is this clearly? A quick question. I see that you
have other elected officials that can't serve. Why, specifically, are
they not able to serve and you have just the two county commissions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The way the current statute is written, there's
several different opportunities for appointments to the Board and under
the previous, under the current version of the Law, it says that the
county Commissioners can only ???? only appoint, maybe, a member of the
Board of Commissioners of a given county. So, since this is a
multi-county Community College where you have Madison and Buncombe both,
what happened in this case, the Madison County Commissioners appointed a
Commissioner under their authority to the AB Tech Board that then
foreclosed the Buncombe County Commissioners from having the ability to
appoint a Commissioner. And, so, it was not the intent by the Madison
County Commissioners to foreclose Buncombe County from doing so. Would
also note this is a perspective Bill so this, if Buncombe County wants
to appoint a County Commissioner to this Board, Buncombe will have to
revote to do so and it is not the intent of this legislation to tell
them who to select. It's up to the majority of the current Board of
Commissioners who they want to be on that Board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Any other questions from the Committee?
Representative Langdon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Any other questions from the Committee?
Representative Langdon, you have the floor for a motion.

opposition? Bill's passed.

You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  House Bill 242 is basically a technical
correction on a technical correction.  Back in 2009, they meant to fit
this retroactively back to 2008 and just missed six words that would
have helped it.  The reason it came to my attention was Bath Fire
Department, which is a very small fire department near the coast, had a
problem with getting their sales tax returned to them.  They contacted
my office after a few weeks of working with the North Carolina
Department of Revenue, we were able to find a loophole that allowed them
to get the sales tax back.  But the main issue is that the language, the
way it reads right now, is that you have to be a 501C organization,
either a 3 or a 4, in order to get your sales tax back.  But that is not
a requirement of the IRS that some of these smaller fire departments
needed.  As far as the fiscal impact, there's about seven thousand
dollars held up in some requests right now, from '08 to now.  If there's
ones out there it was impossible for staff to realize whether or not
there were some others that might be affected.  So I ask for your
support and welcome any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Next up we have House Bill 349.  The chair would like to advise we have
speakers and opposition in the audience.  Representative Floyd, you have
the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  ?? of the committee, this is a local deal from
your city of ?? to allow it to establish a police board there.  The city
has requested that after lengthy community meetings and other meetings
and consultants recommendations, that the city established this board
inconsistent with the cities of Charlotte, Winston, Salem, Durham, and
Greensboro.  The process would to provide greater transparency and
accountability there.  The scope of the investigation would be limited

This also ?? Representative Glazier would also like to add some points
of view as relates to this request.  Mr. Chair, I'd like to ask to stand
to explain the summary.</p>

The Government Committee come to order please. Members take your seats.
Spectators please turn off cell phones or any other electronic devices.
Take your seats. Now welcome to the Government Committee. Today, our
pages are Lexi All, or All, from Johnson County, sponsored by Speaker
Tillis. Where you at? Back there. And Kianna Cooper from Guilford
County. Back there as well, welcome. And Kalee Ritasik. Hi Kalee, how
are you? From Wake County, sponsored by Representative Dollar. And
Adrian Steele from Wake County, sponsored by Representative Holley.
Welcome and thank you ladies for your service here today. Our sergeant
of arms are ??, Doug Harris and Garland Shepherd. Gentlemen, we thank
you for service today. Our staff today, Erica Churchill, Guiles Perry,
Shelly DiAttern, Kelly Quick and Shara Graham and Susan Phillips.
Our first bill on the agenda today, ladies and gentlemen, is House Bill
314. Representative Martin to take the podium. [Pause] It’s House Bill
314. [Pause] You don’t have them?
[Speaker Changes]
Is that the bill?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes, go right ahead. It’s yours.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you. Members of the Committee, this is a fairly straightforward
bill. The town of Ayden is asking to change their change their charters.
They did have a resolution that was signed by the mayor and all of the
council folks. They have been working on this for a number of years.
They had some public hearings and they were able to have 100% support to
change from a two years term for the mayors and commissioners, moving to
a four year staggered term. And the way that we will implement this is
starting with the next election, in 2013, certain seats will run for two
years and certain seats will run for four years. And at the end of the
two years, the remaining people who had run on two years would then move
to a four year term. So in 2015, then everyone would be running for a
four year term, but it would be staggered so that they wouldn’t have a
full turnover at one time. That is the objective of the bill. There’s a
companion filed in the Senate. It has received good support from the
citizens. I made sure it went out… excuse me? It went out in the paper.
If there were any public comments to come back, that we did receive
that.
I will give one correction. On the bill summary it says that they
currently have staggered terms, and that may be what they found when
they looked at the charter, but that is not what is happening in
practice. In practice in the town, it’s everyone runs at the same time
for a two year term.  So we have just discovered this discrepancy this
morning and have gone back to the town to see, are they actually not
following the charter or is there something they’ve done? But I don’t
think it is really relevant to the ??, because we’re talking about
changing it and looking at how we go forward. So in practice today,
they’re all on a two year term, they will come up for election in 2013
and this legislation will take effect then, moving forward. I’m happy to
answer any questions, but I would urge your support of this vote and my
community would be very appreciative.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Representative Martin. Members, are there any questions for
the Representative? Representative Fisher.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I came in just a little bit late, but I wanted
to ask the bill’s sponsor a question. This is, of course, a local bill
and I’m wondering if your delegation is all on board with this local
bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes, thank you that question and the delegation is all on board.
Representative Brian Brown has signed on. There is a companion in the
Senate with Senators Dawn Davis and Lewis Pate for the same bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Members do we have any other questions? Representative Langdon. You’re
recognized for a motion sir.
[Speaker Changes]
I move for a favorable report on House Bill 314.
[Speaker Changes]
??
[Speaker Changes]
It referred to…
[Speaker Changes]
That’s fine.
[Speaker Changes]
It doesn’t go anywhere else, does it?
[Speaker Changes]
No, sir.
[Speaker Changes]
Okay.
[Speaker Changes]
We have a motion on the floor for a favorable report for House Bill 314.
All in Favor say aye.
[Speaker Changes]
Aye [Multiple Voices]
[Speaker Changes]
All opposed say no. The Ayes have it. Thank you, Representative Martin.

...in that adventure in being able to get officers those abilities back
through the court system and this is just a continuation of this, this
is just another way to cut it that apple so to speak. This bill is so
limited that there are no standards of review: Who is going to be on
this committee? How are those committee members going to be selected,
okay? What is their term limits on this committee? I mean they’re just
so many unanswered questions because this bill is so brief.  And the
biggest point that you’ll have is that an officer, let’s give an example
here:  we see it on TV shows and everything, an officer on the take and
bribery or whatever, an officer is complained upon for that particularly
the offence. He can be exonerated for that offense but what goes into
that internal affairs investigation is a complete review of his credit
report, his personal life, whether he’s got things that are going on
personally, the officer may be going through a painful divorce, he may
be having some financial issues or having some problems but he’s not
guilty of taking a bribe.  Well here you have a 15 page document that is
going to have a lot of personal information, the officer is exonerated
but this committee is going to have access to these documents and who on
this committee?  We don’t have anything that tells us this in this bill.
In the city of Winston-Salem where they had this review committee and
personnel files were released to a committee, this eventually went to
the Court of Appeals that ruled in the officer’s favor.  So in
Winston-Salem it was found to be a very much legal problem when this
happened with the citizens review board in that jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Burr we do have a three-minute so just wind up if
you could, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We aren't opposed to transparency but transparency
without accountability is a major problem for us and the officers that
we represent not only in Fayetteville, but throughout this state. Thank
you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you I’m than a take the liberty to let the bill
sponsors respond please
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Chair and I do respect and we
have been negotiating with Mr.Burr and PBA for a long time on this and
they have been negotiating in good faith on it but I do want to respond
because I think there's several things that I just fundamentally
disagree with on the presentation. The first is, the city did what the
delegation requested and passed an ordinance which sets out in detail
the Police/Citizen review board, it sets out the term limits; it sets
out how the Chair and Vice Chair are elected; all the things, the rules,
the procedure, the meetings, the minutes all the things are the City’s
responsibility, it’s not ours to do that, we don’t have that
jurisdiction. Our sole decision to make as a body is whether to agree to
allow the limited release of the confidential information.  Now we
encouraged as a delegation those discussions and I think they’re
productive and I think members who have professional experience are
going to be appointed by the city. None of us as we know from
legislation that were dealing with can predict and say that every city
Council will put the best people they can on, but we have to hope and, I
think,  operate in good-faith. Secondly, with the Winston-Salem case
which I just disagree fundamentally with Mr. Burr on and that is there
was an overreach by Winston-Salem at one point, there was a lawsuit but
it has nothing to do with what we’re talking about.  It was a completely
isolated circumstance where there really was a reason for PBA to sue,
they did and they won, but it is so out of bounds of anything were
talking about that it was very case specific, and has no impact at all.
And we have reviewed the Winston-Salem case. And the last thing that I
would say is , all of those private pieces of information that Mr.
Burr’s talking about,  which he is right should not be disclosed, are
not allowed to be disclosed here.  It’s precisely why the language is
drafted that, the only thing that’s disclose-able is the disposition of
this particular incident and the facts that supporting that disposition.
Not a piece of private information about that officer or anything else
in their file is allowed to be disclosed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Also the city as it looked at the number of consent
searches, one segment of our community received 200 consent searches,
another segment of our community received 2000. It was at that point
that the city decided that we need to do something in order to bring
harmony within our community. And they looked at that, and this was the
best way to do that and the statute provided limited information that is
going to be determined by the city manager, the police chief and also
the city attorney.</p>

<p id="45:00">
So the information that's provided to this committee is going to be
limited.  Even after the committee reviews the information and makes a
recommendation, the ultimate decision rests with the city manager.  The
committee only makes a recommendation, it does not have any statutory
authority to do anything.  That is left with the authority of the city
manager, which he now has to operate and run this city and govern about
1,400 city employees.  So, we ask for your support of this resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  At this time, we'll go back.  we've got 2
more people scheduled to speak, John Midget and Tom Terrel.  If you
would, remember, we have 3 minutes each.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I'm John Midget, I'm the
Executive Director of the North Carolina Police Benevolent Association.
And in point to what Representative Glazier was saying, we have
appreciated a long history of working with the entire legislation here,
and the delegation last year in trying to resolve this.  But I must say,
first and foremost, while the delegation had agreed that we should be
part of some discussions, I'm here to tell you that the city has offered
no option to do that.  In fact, when the bill was withdrawn by the feds
and mayor last year, it was on the understanding that he was not going
to even listen to our concerns, he didn't want to be in a position to
even listen, not have to be required to do anything with them, but to
even listen to them.  The personal history here as been such that we've
had to file legal action in court to stop the city from an obstruction
of justice, which the Attorney General of North Carolin warned the city.
 The general council of the Sheriff's Association declared that he felt
it was a felony obstruction of justice.  To speak specifically to the
bill analysis, while other cities have this, they have employees on the
board.  GS-168, speaks to who can be held accountable under the
provisions of law under those subsections on the release of that
information, that is public officials and public employees, not
citizens, per se.  And what got Winston-Salem in trouble was they had a
board of citizens, they did release information against the city's
wishes, the city ends up defending them in a court against us, and
unfortunately the Court of Appeals said you couldn't do that in that
release.  And this is what we feared.  This is so limited, that is there
a trust factor here?  Not with the delegation here, certainly not with
the legislation supporting this, but with the City of Fayetteville, that
has definitely been the case.  So, doing this only specifically to
police officers, not other public employees, also whatever committee has
been designed, if they release that, even if they have strong penalties
in that, Winston-Salem tried to shut them down and could not do that,
and then was in the precarious position of defending them against us
when we were trying to protect those files.  One other thing I would
like to say, as far as facts to be presented. In facts are details.  In
those details will be information that led the officers to the
conclusion that this was not sustained.  One final point, nothing in
here is about complaints that are sustained.  In other words, if we had
a full blown process where officers were entitled to due process,
officers expect to be held to a higher standard, but if they are not
provided due process to defend themselves against false complaints,
which they are not in this state, other that state law enforcement
officers, then they are subject to the mistakes that can be made because
this is so broadly laid out, that once it's done, you can't pull it
back.  Those officers can being destroyed, and we have now, people who
are being attacked in their homes.  We do have officers who are
assassinated in this state, about 6% annually, so I urge you to not
support it for those reasons, and hope to be able to come with something
we can work together again, and get results.  Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  Next we have up Tom Terrell.  Okay, Tom's
not here.  At this time we'll open up for questions from the committee.
Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  One of my questions was
answered in Representative Glazier's comments, but I want to go back to
something that Representative Floyd said, I have a question.  You said
that one part of town received 200 consented searches, the other part of
town received 2,000.  Can you magnify that, and give me the composition
of each?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You know I don't like to use race in my discussion, but
doing this particular process time that's reported</p>

<p id="50:00">
That had to be reported to the SBI. There was two hundred plus white
searches and two thousand minority searches. Now when you look at
searches, whether or not they was consent searches or not, it's the way
that the officer not being raised a question to the citizen as it
relates to the consent searches. And now since we got it at this point,
it was a republican council person that asked that we stop doing the
consent searches for a period of time, assuming that we could bring some
healing into this process. And last year, a piece of legislation of our
delegation, I was the one that asked the delegation that I would not
support the bill in its present tense.
So, the city again came back with negotiation and asked us to send this
bill forward. And this is what I'm doing now. On behalf of the citizen,
because the city of Fayetville has some healing need to be done, and one
way to do that is to have this piece in place. Is to provide the city
with an opportunity to do that. And the key thing in here is a limited
information. Limited, but that's be determined. And the ultimate
decision resteth with the city manager. Not with the review board
itself. So that's the way the authority allowed. And the city see that
this is the best to bring back more healing in the community and that is
why they asked for ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Presnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe there are four review boards already that
they have already established on this.
And I think that's enough. I'm not going to support the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Alright. Representative Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chair. First of all, I have a question for the bill sponsors and then I
have a comment. My question is how different is this bill from those of
cities, including my city? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the question.
Representative Adams. And just to highlight and respond a bit as well,
and then combine to Representative Presnell's point. Of course each of
those boards that exists are only for the jurisdiction of those cities.
They don't have any jurisdiction in Fayetville, so they can't handle any
Fayetville cases. So we have no capacity. Those boards are strictly
limited to city limits of those cities. We actually spend, and when I
say we, not only the delegation but the city council, spend a lot of
time from issues. All of those boards are more expansive in their
investigative capacity than the Fayetville board.
Our view at the Delegation and we I think articulated that to the city.
That we wanted this confined. So the citizen's review only of the
incident that was at issue. And only to the disposition of that
incident. Some of the city boards that you're talking about have a
broader investigative capacity. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Comment. Yes. This is a comment. It's unfortunate that you have
these kinds of struggles in the cities. I served on the Greensborough
City Council for nine years. I know the gentleman at PBA. I know that
association very well. Worked with them, have a lot of respect for them.
But I've got to tell you that this is a local bill and they are actually
raising concerns about their city. And that's how you do it. You bring
local bills to do that.
So just because they are four cities who support this effort and have by
these review boards, does not mean that other cities who feel that they
need them should have them. I will just say to the committee that what,
we've had some serious issues in Greensborough similar to what you're
talking about. And as a matter of fact, the, from what I know of the
review board that we have in Greensborough, it's basically working
pretty well for our citizens. And it was an opportunity for our city
council to bring at least some closure to some of the problems and
issues that the citizens were raising. And I have a lot of respect for
the police department. But I do think there is something appropriate
about that this process, and I'm going to support the bill for that. I
think we're doing a reasonably good job. Greensborough. I'm not that
familiar with what's going on in the other cities but I think that if
Fayetville believe they need then I think they should have an
opportunity to have it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier. You
will respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. And thank you Representative Adams. I do
want to reiterate to everyone. This has been a multi-year process in our
city. And our city council is divided 5-5 politically. 5 republicans, 5
democrats. It voted 9</p>

Two for this, with one in each party. I believe being the ??. But four
in each party being in favor. Our delegation is a divided delegation in
the house and the senate, but all of us, republican and democrat, are on
board. There's very little public official disagreement. And sometimes
we've seen that in issues and locally. That's not true here. I think all
of us, and I wish we weren't here, but we think that in the end for our
city, given what it's been through the last two years, that the good
good far outweighs the bad here. And I hope you'll defer to the judgment
of the collective will of the delegation and the collective will of our
city elected officials. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Have one question and a comment. ?? Question
for Representative Glazier. Representative Glazier, you have described
the limited nature of the information that can be shared but not being a
lawyer, it does say information relevant to the charge.
What if I'm being charged as an officer with a bribery? Does not then
allow some of the fears that one of the gentleman, wouldn't my financial
information then be relevant information to that charge? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would first suspect that if there was a bribery charge that
that charge would already have moved beyond this capacity before it
would ever get here. And would have moved into the criminal courts since
it is a distinct crime. Most of what's reviewed on these commissions are
issues of force or stop issues. They generally are not the criminal
nature issues. On something like bribery, I suspect it would very
quickly bypass any of this process, be reffered by the chief to the SBI
more than likely for investigation. And we would not be looking at that
kind of issue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I agree. This is not a political issue. This is not a democratic
or republic issue. To me it's an issue of local people not asking us to
do their job, basically. To me, if the chief of police and the city
manager can't control the employees of their departments, perhaps they
need to be replace. It looks like to me we've got a, and I don't know
who these people are, but it looks like to me we're being asked to do
something which the city of Fayetville should be able to handle
internally by their own supervisory process. And if I were a law
enforcement officer, I don't know why in the world I would ever agree to
go to one these four cities or five if we made Fayetville the fifth one,
where I've got another, where in addition to all the other, well my
lights showing green, but anyway.
But where in addition to all the normal supervisory levels you have, you
have this additional level of supervisory jurisdiction you've got to
worry about. It looks like to me Fayetville is asking us to do their
job. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Pibbon. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For a motion, sir. Motion at the appropriate time, I motion for
the time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeal. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. For a question then a comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Could we get a, or can I get a copy at some
point, not necessarily now, but of what Fayetville has passed, what
their law is setting up this. And the question is this. When a citizen,
I assume this is the way it's going to work, and you can explain ?? if
it's not. What this is is a venue for a citizen to file a complaint
against a police officer that he has done something wrong.
He's used excessive force, that he's unduly searched them when they
shouldn't have been searched, or something like that. And isn't that the
job for the courts to decide? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I'm going to have
to answer in several ways. And I think first answer is yes, it creates
that opportunity for a citizen to do that. Remember that what's happened
for a citizen review board to come into play, is there's been some
complaint filed already. As a citizen has a right to do in all our towns
and cities and counties. It's been reviewed by the city manager and the
police chief. They've made a decision. And there is two choices at that
point, a city could have no capacity essentially to review that, other
than the politics of elections and how you deal with that. Or the
citizen can go to court. There is an attempt on the part of our city as
I believe there was and is in Winston Salem Greensborough Durham and
some of the others, to try to keep and resolve disputes locally to give
some confidence to different segments of the public so they won't file
in court so we won't</p>

me seeing lawsuits everywhere. This is an attempt to, given out led to a
citizen that suggests that perhaps the city didn't properly review
everything or didn't know everything.  And I am having been a civil
rights lawyer I think the courts are a grand way to handle some things,
but this goes back fundamentally to our town. We can't do what
Representative Collins wants us to do without the consent of the
confidentiality provision. Our town wants to be able to give citizens an
outlet and a voice shy of them havin to sue. We have gone through what
some of your towns may never go through. It has been a very difficult
two years for our police. And I'm on a slightly different side of the
issue than Representative Floyd. I did not think that the decision to
suspend consent searches was right. And there would have been ways I
think to avoid that had people been talking to each other. But we have a
situation in our town where we need to have confidence of our citizens
which are very evenly split demographically. Our town leaders and now
our delegation believes that this citizen review board, properly
functioning, will provide that outlet. I want to avoid lawsuits. I want
to avoid our officers being put on the front page.  And there is no
other way members for us to do that given the context right now in our
city. And so we're asking you for the confidentiality limitation
provision so the people in our town can have some review and confidence
and we don't end up in court on cases that I fear we will end up in
court on if there's no outlet to for people to think that they got a
fair shake in a review.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry hold on. I apologize. We had a followup over
here. I'm sorry. Representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Let me ask this question and I also have a comment
after this question. What you're setting up is a scenario where a
citizen files a complaint with the police department and it's
investigated internally. Maybe the chief or whoever is involved in that
review process you know does takes whatever action they take and then it
goes to a citizen's review board. What's your procedure that if the
citizen review board disagrees with the findings of the internal
investigation. Do you, I mean, are they bound by your decision?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir this is strictly a recommendation process back
to the city council and the chief and the city manager for them to
reconsider a decision if there's some new information of suggestions by
the review board. The review board as Representative Floyd said has no
final authority or capacity and I don't think it does in any of the
cities. But it has the capacity to recommend different dispositions or
thoughts or actions that might be taken. I want to again suggest,
someone said this earlier, we now have a new city manager actually. He's
from Durham and so he knows the system and is fine with it. So we have
our old city manager recommending this. We have our new city manager
recommending this. We had the police chief who's from Charlotte and he's
been through this and recommends this and our police chief did. So, you
know, I can't tell you, I mean, everybody involved in this shy of the
PDA and there's good reasons why they had concerns. I think we've
addressed them as much as we can. But I think the elected officials, the
city council, the chiefs of police are onboard that this is a good
mechanism for our community to try and we can always stop it at anytime
if it turns not to be a good mechanism.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK next up Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I just have a couple of questions
and a comment. First the answering structure in personnel does the
police chief answer directly to the city manager or directly to the city
council?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Manager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Also there was a comment made and I wanted to
confirm it. Does the public officials, the city elected officials, have
the rights to look at the personnel records of the police officers in
these situations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not to my understanding they. That's personnel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's a personnel matter they can not look in those
personnel files.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's limited, you know, as the statute stated
Representative Glazier can go into more detail. You know they can not do
that my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would probably respectfully disagree just a little
bit. I think that there are limited circumstances in which state
statutes allow the governing body to look at the personnel records of
people they are employing.  So I think that city council</p>

To do that, for a limited extent there are times in which they are not
allowed to. I mean, fishing expeditions, personal matters and that kind
of thing. But, on an official business my thought, and I can confirm it
they can have some capacity to do that. This of course, is for the
citizen review board and we don't want them to have any capacity to do
that, except the limited information that they're reviewing, with regard
to the disposition and the incident that occurred.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
My concern with this is, I'm a town official, or was a town official
from a small town. Our police chief answered directly to the town board
and we changed that format. In this type situation, I'm scared that this
will undermine the whole authority of the city council. If this is a
major issue with the city council, they should be able to review, to a
certain extent, these personnel files. If its that big of a problem than
they should fire the police chief, or fire the city manager, if they
have that big of a problem. Now, you are creating an additional board
that has access to personnel records, that has no accountability to the
voters. That's a concern of mine, so I don't think that I will be
supporting the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, unfortunately and fortunately we have a council manager form of
government, where in that the council sets the rules and the manager
carry out the wishes of the council. There as he has statchertary
responsibility to look at the employees for the city of [?], not the
council.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a few brief comments on the bill. I
am in favor of this type of internal review. The main reason is one of
the purposes the author said to avoid complicity. I have a lot of
friends who are in law enforcement as well as family members. I've also
practiced a lot of law and probably had thousands of cases that come
before the judge. A lot of these matters that we're talking about come
out in a much more public way. They come out in accusations from
defendants, they come out, they're drawn out through attorneys who are
arguing policeman made mistakes or did things improperly. This type of
internal review, I think, could be a favor to law enforcement. Friends
that I have, as well as family members they can be vetted and discussed
in a less public way. So, I really see this as a release valve.
Something that could help law enforcement officers.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Any questions from the committee? Representative McNeil.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, I respectfully disagree with Senator Hall. This is not an internal
review, its an external review. Police officer's are governed by a lot
of laws that they have to deal with each and every day. What they do is
reviewed time, and time, and time again. Its reviewed by the courts, its
reviewed by their supervisors, its reviewed by their police chief, it's
reviewed by the city manager, the council. They have certification
processes they have to go through. I just think this is adding one more
level or one more thing on our police officers that they don't deserve.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Representative Pittman withdraw your amendment, motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Mr. Chair. What we are asking for is a favorable report, this bill
will also go to the judiciary, if there's any additional venting. Which
is a much better, you know, you can look at it and make sure the
corrections are there. We're just asking for approval so that it can be
defered to judiciary.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Have any other comments from the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman. May I make a suggestion? Since there's a continuing
discussion, like there was last time, I think it might be useful, one
other option that might be available to the committee is to make a
motion to refer to judiciary without prejudice, not as a favorable
report. Which allows us to get to the judiciary committee and actually
get more concerns on the confidentiality provision taken care of there.
So, it is an option that the members might have and I might suggest.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Boles.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I second Representative Glacier's wording.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
So, you make a motion . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Make a motion without prejudice to judiciary.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We have a motion on the floor. All in favor say, aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All opposed, nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
In the opinionated chair, the aye's have it.</p>

[Speaker changes.] Thank you. Next up, House Bill 110. There's a PCS
before the Committee. Representative Collins makes a motion to put the
PCS before us.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman.  House Bill 110 is a bill
which prohibits the state and it's political subdivisions from requiring
or prohibiting PLA's, which are Project Labor Agreements, in government
construction contracts or conditioning the award of grants for taxes on
the existence or the absence of Project Labor Agreements. The bill does
allow contractors who choose to unilaterally enter into agreements with
unions on a project. They are not prohibited from doing so.  What this
bill basically does is, like I said, it prohibits PLA's or Project Labor
Agreements and the purpose is to insure that we have an economy and
efficiency on taxpayer-funded construction projects in North Carolina.
PLA's have been found to increase construction costs. Some studies have
shown that they increase construction cost up to 25%.  We're only trying
to establish a level playing field for all bidders who want to bid on
construction projects or public construction projects in North Carolina.
I urge your support.  And I think we have an amendment, Mister Chairman.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, if I could, before the amendment,
this legislation is supported by both the Association of Builders and
Contractors as well as the Association of General Contractors...ABC and
AGC. Mister Chairman, I don't know the latitude of the Chair but there
are representatives of both organizations in the audience and if you
want to let them make comments, they are here.
[Speaker changes.] We'll do the amendment first.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Moffitt.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair. I'd like to send forth an
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Moffitt, could you explain your
amendment?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.  Thank you, Mister Chair. Members of the
Committee, this is a fairly simple amendment.  It's more technical in
nature.  On line 20, we're taking the three words out...&quot; entering
into or&quot; will be removed by the amendment.  I'd ask for your
support.
[Speaker changes.] Do we have a motion? No, this is just a technical
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Moffitt, please repeat.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair. It's line 20 on page one,
under Section 1, Part B...B1...line 20, the first three words
&quot;entering into or&quot; will be removed.
[Speaker changes.] Any questions on the amendment?
[Speaker changes.] All those in favor of the amendment, say Aye. (AYES.)
All those opposed.  Amendment passes. Back on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, one other thing, this bill's been
filed for two months.  We have not heard any opposition from any labor
groups or any other group since it's been filed.
[Speaker changes.] Representative ????????
[Speaker changes.] A motion at the appropriate time.
[Speaker changes.] Any questions from the committee?  Comments?
Representative ???? Back for a motion.
[Speaker changes.] I'd like to move that House Bill 110 receive
favorable report and refer to finance.
[Speaker changes.] As amended.
[Speaker changes.] As amended.
[Speaker changes.] Rolled into a PCS.
[Speaker changes.] You got it.
[Speaker changes.] You heard the motion before us.  All those in favor
say Aye. (Ayes.) Any opposed.  Bill passes.
[Speaker changes.] Next we have up is House Bill 153. Representative
Cleveland, you have the floor.
[Speaker changes.] Committee House Bill 153 is going to set up an
oversight committee...a joint oversight committee for general
government.  It'll authorize the committee to make recommendations to
the General Assembly on ways to improve effectiveness, efficiency and
quality of the government services ????? cover departments and agencies
will provide and these are the general government agencies.  It
????????? that the commission be composed of twelve members, six from
the Senate and six from the House...</p>

and requires whatever covered department or agency is required by law to
report to the general assmebly on matters affecting the services the
department or agency provides. We'll also provide a copy of the report
to the joint legislative oversight committee and local government.
Presently, if there are any problemss in the general govenrment
agencies, there's really no way to take a look at them and see if we can
correct them until we get back into session. And this oversight
committee would be something that could meet between sessions and help
resolve some potential problems. In the past several years, some have
cropped up and it was nigh on impossible to try to resolve them. Matter
of fact, some continued on and things happened that shouldn't have
happened. And with the oversight committee, it'll help prevent that type
of thing.
