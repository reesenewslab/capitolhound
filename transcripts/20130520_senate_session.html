Senate will come to order. Sargent at Arms close the doors. Members, go

gallery will please stand.

Let us pray. Dear God I thank you for the United States of America and
this great state of North Carolina. I realize that while there are a lot
of things wrong in this great country, there's also more things that is
right. May your elected leaders together, work together to strive to do
what is best for all citizens. While this task may be great and seem
impossible, with divine help, all things are possible. I believe that
even with the problems we have in this country, United States of America
is still the best place in the world in which to live and many of us
would agree that North Carolina is the best state. For our state and
country to be a better place to live not only must their leaders work
together, but the citizens must work with their leaders. We must build a
?? for others trying to do their best at home and at work in order for
North Carolina and their country to be all it can be. Lord, help us in
that area. Lord, be with those in the senate chamber. They must make
hard decisions at times. And as they reason together,  may they make
them with integrity and with the assurance they have made the best
decision they could considering the problems at hand. Even though
everyone will not agree with the laws they make, may they have peace of
mind they did the best they could. And God, in a day in which we live,
we all must make sacrifices to keep America strong. May we as citizens
be willing to do our part. God bless America and in Christ's name we
pray, Amen.
