[Speaker Changes] Senator Widdard is recgonized to speak to the
resolution.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and Gentlemen, the
Senate. As the Senator representing Person County, it is a distinct
priviledge for me to bring this resolution to you from our colleagues in
the House and specifically my colleague representative Wilkins, in
memory of James Edward Ramsey. Youv'e heard the resolution and you've
heard of his service, including the term of speaker of the house in 1973
and 74. It's also a personal privilege for me today to recognize a great
man and public servant. I went around to see who actually served with
speaker Ramsey, and there is only one of us left in this whole building
who actually served with him. And that was the Dean of General Assembly,
Representative Michaux, and it was Micky's first term here when speaker
Ramsey was actually a Speaker of the House..</p>

<p id="10:00">
So our memory of him has faded a little bit, but I can assure you that
in Roxboro &amp; Person County, the memory has not faded. But I have my
own memory of Speaker Ramsay. As a young boy, I came to this building
for the first time in the winter of 1973 as a Page, and I met Jim Ramsey
at that time as Speaker of the House. And I have to tell you for those
who knew Speaker Ramsey, he had quite a presence about him. Physical,
his voice, the way he carried himself. And I have to tell you, and a 13
year old- 14 year old Page at that time, meeting Speaker Ramsey, he
epitomized to me what it was to be a public servant. The way he carried
himself, and conducted his work here at the general assembly, and the
way he represented his district. And it is a very fond memory I’ve
always had of Speaker Ramsey. He concluded his term after service then
as Speaker of the House, as you all know, they were term limited then,
they served one term, and Speaker Ramsey chose to pursue other political
pursuits, and then ultimately to go back home and practice law in
Roxboro. But I’ve never forgotten my short week here and seeing Speaker
Ramsey at work. And that’s why it’s the particularly Personal Privilege
for me to present this resolution to you today. He really was a force
here in the general assembly, he influenced a number of important things
during his tenure here. His law partner recounted a story of important
Saturday meetings that Speaker Ramsey often had in his law office.
Charlie Hubbard told a story one day of pulling in on a Saturday and the
parking lot was full of cars all with Senate and House license plates on
them, and as Mr. Charlie went by the conference room, there was Speaker
Ramsey with Bill Friday, Leo Jenkins, and legislative leaders
negotiating the East Carolina University Medical School. And he had many
other great accomplishments during his service. And after his tenure
here at the general assembly, he went back to practice law and he was
very proud of his work as an attorney and for many years, he really was
the dean of the Person County Bar Association. And in fact, was
practicing law until the day just before his death. A lot of folks saw
him at the courthouse that very day, doing what he loved. He loved his
community and you heard in the resolution the many different
organizations that he proudly served. And of course, he loved his family
a great deal, and many of the Ramsey family members are with us here
today. So, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I commend
to you this House resolution in memory of James Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Is there any further discussion ?? ? Senator
McKissick, for purpose ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I’d like to also thank Jim Ramsey’s family for allowing him to serve
as leader in this state and he was certainly someone I had great
admiration and respect for. Many of you think of me as coming from
Durham County, that was my ?? place where I was born, but I was also
very active up in Warren County at one time, and the Democratic Party,
and the rest of the young Democrats came into that party. Of course,
Warren County, Vance County, and Person County at one point were all i
the same Congressional district, as well as the state House district. So
I had an occasion to really work with him on many occasions.
Representative Ramsey was always active, he was always visible within
the district, always responsive to the needs of constituents. Whenever
you came to him, for whatever might ?? or need to be done, he always had
a willing ear, and was always willing to put the resources of his
position to work for the people within that House district that he
represented. So he was someone that I came to work with on many, many,
many occasions, even as a lawyer, we had been colleagues on many
occasions. As recently as a year ago, we had cases we were working over
in Person County, last June, last July, last August. And during that
time, he suffered a stroke. The case that we were involved in had to be
continued. He came back. He was strong as ever, working as aggressively
as ever on behalf of his clients. He never missed a heartbeat in any
respect. Someone who I admired. Someone who I respected. Someone who was
an exceptional lawyer with a brilliant legal mind. Someone who was
committed to all the constituents of his district, regardless of what
walks of life they came from, regardless of what they brought to the
table. Somebody who served North Carolina well. Someone who I can say to
his family certainly provided tremendous leadership for which we will
ever be indebted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

resolution 1016 on a second reading. All in favor will vote aye, oppose

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. House Bill 214 provides that all records
containing a personal information and collected are compiled by the
North Carolina Real Estate Commission shall not be a public record
unless admitted into evidence at a hearing held by the Commission. This
is brought to us from the Real Estate Commission. It will protect its
licensee from unnecessary disclosure of personal information not related
to their brokerage activities. The Commission is seeking a change in the
law similar to the law governing the license board of the CPAs. The
Commission would still provide business addresses and contact
information even if that business address is also the broker's
residence. I appreciate your support.

321, clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 321, amend local solid waste planning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. ?? I'm running this one behalf of
representative McGrady. This bill passed the house, 111 to zero. It does
away with the reporting requirement that mandates local governments must
develop and maintain a solid waste management plan. It is my
understanding there is no opposition of this bill. There were two
amendments added. One was – the first one was totally technical in
nature. It was added earlier in House Bill 321 to make sure that we are
not conflicting in any other language. And in the second amendment was
to address the local landfill issue in Senator Hartsell's district and I
ask for your support and be happy to entertain any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, what purpose you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I ask Senator Jackson a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, let me ask this. I can remember when legislation was
recently passed requiring local governments to comply with these –
creating these plans, and of course the goal was to decrease, decrease
the amount of refuge and trash going into our landfills in the states.
So you want to decrease the flow and not need as much landfill capacity.
Now, was anybody able to share with you what the logic was now in
repealing this, because I wasn’t sure why we would not want local
governments to continue doing that sort of a planning, so you reduce the
amount of capacity you need in your landfills or – or if the legal
municipalities raised any concerns about it or perhaps you can share
something with me that might be enlightening?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, I will try. Basically all this does from what my
understand is does away with the reporting requirement and the reports
not necessarily anything that you will speak into in your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. That helps, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, for what purpose you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward amendment, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, you can send forward your amendment and the clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell is recognized, explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. ?? it should be on your dashboard. It is a
clarifying amendment that spells out in its much specificity as possible
the grandfathering, the grandfathered area that’s identified earlier by
Senator Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]House Bill 467, Breast Density Notification and
Awareness.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Robinson is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President.  And, first I'd like to thank
Senators Pate and Hise for their support, and finally getting this bill
brought to the floor, even though my own Bill 519 didn't meet cross
over, but this bill is the same and it's essential to the awareness in
terms of women and their own health.  The Breast Density Bill is an
awareness bill.  Most women don't know the details about mammograms, and
what that information is.  Breast density is information that is
important is terms of what is offered from a mammogram, and it increases
awareness in terms of the possible incidence of breast cancer.  Breast
tissue under mammograms often camouflages what could be cancerous
tissue.  Both are very white, and for those of you who are women here,
and thanks for your support, but also men who have spouses or partners,
it's important that women have the mammogram, but also to understand
that the breast dense tissue can camouflage cancer.  40% of women have
dense breast tissue.  House Bill 467 requires that all health facilities
that perform mammograms include information about the patient's breast
density in the report.  It also requires that the letter that goes to
women state if she has breast dense tissue, and that it may be
associated with increased risk of breast cancer, and that she should
discuss this information with her doctor to determine if more screening
is necessary.  When this bill was presented to us in  Greensboro, and
even last week, we heard testimonies from women who have been diagnosed
during the later stages of breast cancer.  If they had had that
information earlier, a mastectomy may have not had been necessary, or
chemotherapy, or whatever the other treatment.  In the breast health
education screening that my own agency does with Gilford County Health
Department, and now through the B-step program at Women's Hospital, we
know that information is power.  The largest percentage of breast cancer
fatalities are amongst African American women who are diagnosed in the
later stages.  This information that will come in the letter along with
additional information and referral to a woman's doctor will help to
prevent some of the fatalities.  So, this is a no-brainer, as a lot of
you said in the health care committee, but it's very important to
preventative health.  So, I want to thank you and commend the bill to
you, and I know that our Lieutenant Governor will recognize an advocate
who is here.
Thank you Senator.  Is there any further discussion or debate?  Hearing
none, the question for the Senate is the passage of Senate committee
substitute to House Bill 467, on its 2nd.</p>

House Bill 474, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 474, Redeposit Government Funds into
Insured Deposit Accounts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Under North Carolina law,
deposits by an entity of State or local government must be the fully
insured or backed by the assets of the bank that has been pledged. As an
alternate to pledging assets, banks are permitted to use a reciprocal
deposit placement service. Currently, North Carolina laws only allows
this structure for certificates of deposit. What this bill will do will
change the references in applicable North Carolina statutes from
certificates of deposits to deposit accounts. This will allow government
depositors greater flexibility to move money around. I know of no
opposition. The North Carolina State Treasurer and Office of
Commissioner of Banks have been consulted and have no opposition.
Appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the gentleman yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will do my best.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the money still going to be guaranteed? And I've
used that word loosely, but right now it's either got to be insured or
you got to put up capital assets to secure it. And I'm not sure what
this does. Is there still something standing for the money, dollar for
dollar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The answer to the question if I may, Senator Nesbitt,
is yes, certainly. As you know, currently you either have to have FDIC
insurance or you must have the assets from the bank pledged to secure
those deposits. But because of technology today, they are able to use
the deposits where they literally pool with other banks so that that
money is always insured. It's called Reciprocal Deposit Placement
Services. We have that now. What this will do, though, will allow us to
have certificates of deposits and deposit accounts. This way the money
can be used in a CD for a better return, or it can be used for a shorter
term for more flexibility. It does not change the fact that they are
fully insured.

Bill of rights.

Senator Barring is recognized to explain the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister president this bill simply provides a policy statement.
A policy that promotes stability basic security and dignity for the
thirteen thousand five hundred and forty eight foster children in the
state of North Carolina such as freedom from abuse neglect and danger. I
grappled with what to say about this bill and I've decided to just get
down to a few brass tacts. Those children in foster care spend stand
about as much or less chance of being paroled from a prison than they do
from getting out of the grasp of the North Carolina foster care system.
I learned that through my eleven years as a foster parent. Until we can
provide loving caring and permanent homes for these thirteen thousand
plus children it's our job to do the best we can for them and this bill
is a good start. It's only a start and while I'm here I plan to try to
make something better of that start. I urge your support of this bill

The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 802, landlord, tenant shorten eviction
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Randleman is recognized, explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. House Bill 802 shortens the
time it takes to evict a tenant. By requiring the magistrate to render a
judgement on the same day of the hearing, it is limiting continuance by
the magistrates. If it's more than five days it must be agreed to by the
parties. It limits the time to pay the appeal costs of court for ten
days. It allows the landlord to request a dismissal in an appeal if the
tenant does not state in defense for non-payment of rent or has failed
to pay the bond. It reduced the time the landlord is required to hold
the tenants property after the landlord has won the case, the writ has
been executed and the rental unit is locked from ten days to seven days.
It requires the AOC to develop a forum for parties in some [??] cases to
inform them of the timeline and process. And Mr. President I need to
send forward a technical correction amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you can send forward your amendment, the clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Randleman moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Randleman is recognized, explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The amendment is purely a technical
correction, in section five it makes the reduction from ten to seven
days consistent throughout the statute and also to clarify when the
seven day period begins. It begins when the writ is executed. So I
appreciate your support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing on the
question before the Senate is the passage of amendment one, all in favor
vote aye, opposed vote no. Five seconds we'll have for the voting and
the clerk will record the vote. 48 having voted in the affirmative and 1
in the negative, amendment one is adopted the bill as amended is back
before the body. Is there any further discussion or debate? Ms. Senator
Bryant for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President to debate the bill and to send forth and
amendment. I'd like to speak first and then I'll send forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. President and colleagues, this bill
does a great job of tightening the time limits for getting possession of
your property once there's been a violation of the terms of the lease.
There is one area of concern that many of the advocates are still
worried about, and that is the seven calendar days they allow for the
tenant once the writ of execution is executed to pick up their personal
belongings if those personal belongings are valued over $500. We have
gotten this process down, or the sponsors have done a good job of
getting this process down to about 28 days if everybody follows all the
procedures, and even if you ass the time for getting the property of the
tenant, it would be at most about 38 days. The problem is, is seven
calendar days for your to pick up your property but the landlord is only
required to make it available for your during business hours, nine to
five during their business hours. And we were attempting to get the
change of seven calendar days. For example over the recent holiday
period if a writ had been issued the person would really have had three
business days given all the other, the weekend and the calendar days.
Now some people argue, well, you know you haven't paid your rent, you've
had 30 days already or longer if you know that you are violating your
lease, but I also work in my community with a lot of people who are
dealing with this tenuous situation related to homelessness. A lot of
times the issue is not only involving the rent, in our area it's
involving the utility payments as well. People are juggling both and
then they realize they can't do it, they spend part of the time trying
to get the money and then the other part of the time trying to find
somewhere else to move, and then part of the time trying to find
somebody to help you move your stuff. It is unfortunate to have people's
stuff be put on the street or disposed of when that's the only
belongings they have. So I'd like to send forth an amendment to request
we approve seven calendar days for the person to pick up their
belongings after the write is issues, I mean, I'm sorry, seven business
days, I'm sorry, instead of seven calendar days. Seven business days for
the person to pick up their belongings after the writ is issued which is
the same amount of time...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant you must speak to the amendment, let's
read it in and then you can have time to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you send your amendment forward, clerk who has it,
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant moved to amend a bill.

<p id="45:00">
Recognized to explain the amendment, so Senator, you can continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and that was the amendment. That we look at
7 business days just at the end if the person needs that to get their
belongings moved, it would only apply to belongings valued over $500
that's the only time that right would kick in, and we think that's
really important to allow folks in the vulnerable situation to not lose
all their belongings. I'd appreciate your support for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Randleman, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to debate the amendment, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Randleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman, I have spoken with the primary
sponsors in the House, it was Senator Beverly Earl and also Bill
Brawley. They're opposed to this amendment, and I guess that's why they
picked me to explain this bill on the floor. Most of these folks, I'd
say all these folks know that they haven't paid their rent. They knew
when they didn't pay their rent, so these people have had to go into
court, they've had to go through the legal process to get to the point
that they could get a writ of possession. The writ has already been
executed, the sheriff has padlocked the door and we're talking about the
belongings that are there post-execution, so on behalf of the primary
bill sponsors, I would ask you to oppose the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Hearing none, the question before
the Senate is the passage of amendment 2. All in favor will vote aye,
all opposed will vote no, 5 seconds will be allowed for the voting. The

weekend if my calendar's right and I tried to notify the senators, it
was Senator Newton on the 5th, Senator Rabin on the 6th and Senator
Sanderson on the 7th. Happy birthday to you all. I have one more follow
up on that. A few weeks ago I announced to the Senate my concern about
the Homeleave Program. I'd originally heard from the President of the
Conference of DAs, Phil Berger, Jr about the situation that we had 30
plus 1st degree murders, 13 of which were serving life sentences that
the weekend prior had actually gotten out of jail and were able to spend
that weekend home with their families. Number of other criminals that
brought that to light, the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety,
Karen Shanahan and the governor appears to have acted quickly on that.
They have stopped Homeleave for all individuals serving life in prison.
If you can believe that they actually had it at one time. Also in this
state one of the earliest ?? they have felt for the Victims Rights
amendment to our constitution that was passed several years ago. It
requires that victims of crimes in North Carolina actually be notified
of the change of status of any criminal getting out of jail and such.
That has also been, if you can believe that it wasn't part of the
administrative law, it's also been reinstituted, so that when anyone
approaching the time for their prison sentence to end is able to get a
home leave, hopefully those were only the non-violent individuals, who
need to get back into their community, be able to establish some ties,
and in those limited instances, they will be required, the prison system
will be required now to contact both the District Attorney and the
victim's families to notify them of the home release of these criminals.
So we thank the governor and I thank the governor and the Secretary of
the Department of Public Safety for their swift action in this matter.
Thank you, Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Any
further notices or announcements? Is there any other business to come
before the Senate? If not, the chair recognizes Senator Berger for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I move the Senate do
now adjourn subject to the re-referral of bills and resolutions, the
receipt of messages from the House and the Governor and the ratification
of bills to reconvene on Wednesday, July 10, 2013 at 2pm. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The motion is the Senate do now adjourn subject to the

10th at 2pm, seconded by Senator Goolsby. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER
