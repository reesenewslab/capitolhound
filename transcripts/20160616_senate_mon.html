[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 793 Charter School Modifications.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. President. This bill makes the Charter
School Advisory Board to review the application process and foremost the
speeding up of the process. It allows for fast tracking of certain
applications and it changes the date for the final deadline of the
application process and it opens the charter schools, it makes them
comply with the open meetings law requirements as well as the full
disclosure of ?? and so forth and to clarify some of this, Mr.
President, I have an amendment to send forth, I believe you’d have a
copy of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment, you may have it on your dashboards –
hoping you do. Page 1 which is the title, lines 2 through 9 and rewrites
the title because of additional provisions that we’ve added to the bill.
Page 1 lines 20 through 21 requires state board of education to make a
decision on the approval or the denial of a charter application by
August 15th rather than January 15th. Makes clear the state board of
education can make the final approval contended upon the successful
completion of a planning period before enrolling students. Page 1 lines
30 and 31 clarifies state board of education ?? a charter renewal for
less than 10 years if the charters bill is not in compliance with state
and federal laws, its own bylaws or in its charter agreement with the
state board of education. Page 2 lines 16 and 17 allows priority
enrolment for the children of members of board of directors of charter
schools beyond the initial year of operation and page 2 lines 23 and 24
requires a local school administrative unit to provide and additional
information requested by charter school from the ?? that allows a
charter school to audit and verify the  calculation  and  transfer  of
the  per  pupil  share  of  the  local  current  expense fund and
requires that any payment resulting from a judgment from ?? and the
Charter School be paid in full within one year from the entry of the
judgment rather than the current 3 years. Page 2 line 29 is a technical
change only. Page 2 line 29 requires the state board of education to
consider entities that have operated another charter school in the State
for three years rather than 5 years when established in the criteria for
the competitive bid process to take over a failing charters bill. Page 2
line 30 is a technical change only. Page 2 line 32 is another technical
change. Page 2 lines 37 and 38 directs the state board of education to
adopt a process and rules for a fast track replication process of high
quality charter schools in the state and state board of education would
adopt the rules and procedures for this by December 15th 2014 and report
to Ed Oversight by February 15th 2015.</p>

and, finally page 2, lines forty and forty-one, amends the effective
date section to ensure that the section of the bill that changes how
long a losing party has to pay a judgment only applies to lawsuits filed
on or after the date of the enactment of the bill. I'll be glad to take
questions. Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for [xx]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to see if Senator Tillman will yield to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Mr. Tillman, does the state board have an
opinion on either of the process for fast track or the acceleration of
the date by when they have to render a decision?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've worked with the state board throughout this process and they've not
objected to any of that language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator McKissick, [xx]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[xx] Senator Tillman will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, how does this reapplication process work today, 'cause
this establishes one hundred and twenty days for the process to move
forward take place for I guess analysis by the state board of education
to do whatever review it needs to conduct and then make a decision. How
long do they currently have to go through that process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The process now can take 6 months or more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield for follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I guess it goes back to one of the things Senator Stein asked: is
the state board prepared, I mean are the comfortable with, reducing it
from one hundred and eighty days all the way down to one hundred and
twenty days, and is that one hundred and eighty days, the 6 months, is
that statutorily established, or through rules, procedures? How is that
done?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, it's hard to hear Senator McKissick, but the state board
has not objected to the shortened time period. I have not had an
objection to this at all. I wouldn't be surprised if I heard one
tomorrow, but so far they're good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank  you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I have one question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, there is a section in here, I was just trying to follow
it, where we added in that the school unit would have to provide any
additional information requested by a charter school in order for the
charter school to audit and verify the calculation and transfer of the
per pupil share after they went through 3 [xx] they have to share the
total amount of money they have in each of their funds. The student
membership numbers used for the calculation, how the per pupil share was
calculated. Can you give me a sense of what additional information they
might mean? I'm just worried that we're opening some kind of fishing
expedition. Maybe not, but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me...Mr. President, what we have found is that most of the LEAs are
very compliant and give the information fully. Others are a little less
forthcoming and do not provide the information and the data so there's
some distrust among some of the units from the charters. This simply
lets the charter ask for more information to clarify the numbers to make
sure they're getting their fair share. That's all that is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield for follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, I don't remember the rest of the bill, or this section.
Is there, who would be the arbiter if there's some dispute between what
they're asking for and what the LEA is giving? Is there anyone who would
oversee this, or decide this, or is it just sort of...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, the legislation says that they will have an opportunity
to sit down over a fifteen day period and hash out their differences. If
that fails, then a lawsuit can, in some cases, have been filed to
mitigate and mediate this conflict. You got some pretty strict language
in there about loser pays, though, so I think that will tamp down the
lawsuits, and in ninety-nine percent of the cases get agreement on the
dollars that are due.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the Senate is the passage of amendment 1, all in favor vote aye,
opposed will vote no. Five seconds to be allowed for the voting, the
clerk will record the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bryant, aye.

Senate bill 815, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bill 815, ensuring privacy on student records.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Barefoot is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. We can all agree that as we
move forward with implementing new technologies in the classroom that
ensuring privacy of our student records has got to be a top concern. So
what we have here before us is a bill that does just that. It would
require the state board of education to make publicly available
information regarding the student data system otherwise known as power
school, create rules and plans to ensure privacy and security of
individual student data in the student data system and restrict the
collection of certain data in the student data system. The proposed
legislation would also require local boards of education to provide
notice on ?? rights and ?? opportunities, recording students records and
participation in certain surveys. I know opposition to the bill pass
unanimously through our Senate education and J1 committee and I ask you
to support the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.

Senator Rucho is recognized to talk to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, thank you, and members of the Senate. I stand to send forward
Charlton Allen position to the Industrial Commission. There was a
vigorous debate during the commerce meeting. A lot of good questions. It
seemed as Mr. Allen is mroe than competent to take on this job and
provide balance in the approaching Industrial Commission and I would
urge that the members of the committee support HJR 1112.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho urges your support. Is there any further discussion or
debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Curtis, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, Mr. Allen lives in my district and I'd like to encourage
you to appoint him to the Industrial Commission. Although we're not
personal friends I've known Charlton Allen for many years and know him
to be a reasonable and fair person who will serve the citizens of North
Carolina with integrity. In his practice as an attorney he is known for
being fair, reasonable, and just and I'm confident he'll serve the state
of North Carolina well on the Industrial Commission. So I recommend that
you confirm Mr. Allen without any hesitation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, some of you may know
but others may not, that the Industrial Commission is a quasi-judicial
body that's established to adjudicate disputes between employers and
employees when somebody gets injured on the job. Was it a workplace
injury or not? And they are essentially judges. They take testimony,
they evaluate evidence. They have authority to issue civil or criminal
contempt in certain instances and the way the structure is done is there
are six of these folks. Three are representatives of employers and three
are representatives of employees and in the hearing we had the other day
Mr. Allen, he said, &quot;yes I do not believe that the minimum wage
should exist.&quot; He said that the minimum wage is an unfair intrusion
in the labor market. Folks can have different opinions on whether the
minimum wage should exist or not. He clearly believes there shouldn't be
one. I believe that such a person is not suitable to be a representative
of employees and for that reason will be voting against Mr. Allen
tonight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I also share a very deep concern about this particular candidate and it
comes from a variety of sources. If you think about him serving the
interest of employees but he's articulated, during the time he ran for
public office on other occasions, even recent occasions, that he does
not support the minimum wage. I think that's a very significant reason
of itself. If you look back to other conduct that he has allegedly
engaged in, conduct that could be interpreted by many as being
anti-semitic, potentially insensitive to issues related to race as well
as other areas that we would like to see him address. He's really failed
to do so. I know during our committee meetings I specifically wanted to
keep a very open mind about this candidate. I wanted to give him an
opportunity to clear the record, to clear the air and ask him if there
was anything that had been alleged about him that he wanted to
repudiate, that he wanted to create some distance when it came to things
that have been alleged about his conduct and he failed to do so. That
gives me deep, deep concern. There have been many people, like George
Wallace, former Governor of Alabama, like Senator Strom Thurmond down in
South Carolina who held views and perspectives in bygone era which they
understood were things that were perhaps mistaken judgments which they
later repudiated which won them widespread acceptance and acclaim when
they subsequently ran for office. When you make mistakes, when you
engage in conduct that is questionable it's important for a candidate,
when they're considering being appointed this type of significant
quasi-judicial position, to clear the air. If they want to clear their
name, clear their name. If they want to create distance, create
distance. If they want to repudiate bad acts of conduct in the past,
many people when they're young adults make mistakes. But I think it's
important that they come clean, clear the air. Clear that sea of
ambiguity and let people understand what their true intentions were, if
they're explainable, and if not just simply say I made a mistake. I
wouldn't do it today and I hope that if I'm allowed to serve in this
position that my reputation and my name will be evaluated based upon
decisions I make from this point going forward. Please don't think that
I am that person that I once was. This candidate did not accept the
opportunity to do so and for that reason I cannot support this
resolution.

Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman has the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wasn't sure, Senator McKissick, what I was hearing there and I had to
listen carefully. I suppose that minorities are the only ones on the
minimum wage and to refer to this gentleman here as a, there may be
racial undertones regarding his views on minimum wage. I heard that.
Referring in the same speech to Strom Thurmond, a great American, and to
George Wallace, who you, I guess you would. To bring these two up in
this conversation, I'm a little bit appalled, Senator. But many
economists that I know believe that the marketplace will determine
minimum wage and that's what many of us believe. And then it will fall
where it may fall and whether you're a proponent of minimum wage and
raising it to 10 or 15 dollars an hour it's not fair to look at this
highly qualified individual in the terms that I just heard him
described. I'm a little disappointed. I urge you to vote for this
resolution.

Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock has the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick speaks of a publication. I would say consider the
source. If you look at this free newspaper and what type of
advertisements they take, they do have one advertisement that I think is
original, it's for a witch doctor where it says, &quot;psychics predict
voodoo gets results.&quot; Now you think about that's what type of
publication that's printing this information. I think it's despicable
but I'll tell you a little bit about Mr. Alan. I've known him for about
two decades and there's no one more honorable, who's better for this
job, to represent the people on the Industrial Commission. We've looked
at people who have been appointed to the commission</p>

Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker has the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've known Mr. Allen a short while. He was roommate of my LA at
Carolina. A couple of facts that my friend did not mention, Senator
McKissick, was the fact that chair of the committee would not allow him
to respond about something that transpired in his college days. All I
can say is thank God nobody asked me about my college days at NC State.
And the second thing is to Senator Stein remembers the fact that most of
his law practice in the last several years has been where he's
represented employers. I mean, excuse me, employees against employers so
he has the balance. Both qualified in the legal profession and in
practicing law and certainly his character should not be questioned. I
urge you to support the resolution please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify any statements I might have made. When I speak of
minimum wage I speak of that for all workers. Not simply for minorities.
So I want to make sure that's abundantly clear and when I offer an
opportunity to a candidate in committee to clear the air, to clear the
sea of ambiguity, to address concerns that have been raised and I do it
in a non-judgmental way in an open-minded way, wanting to find within
that candidate the quality of person that I think we need to serve in
this type of quasi-judicial capacity and when we understand based upon
news accounts and stories and true, not all news accounts and stories
are always accurate, but when there's enough out there that's being
said, references that are being made and there's no opportunity to
provide any context for your conduct, when a person is silent, when a
person does not address it then you have to begin to wonder if some of
those accusations, some of those statements are not accurate. When you
understand that the University of North Carolina and the Chancellor and
that institution, that very fine institution distanced itself from the
publications that this person was involved with, that he was the leader
of in crafting and writing articles about, when there are caricatures
that were drawn that were questionable in terms of their intent and how
they were meant to cast, perhaps, dispersions upon a person who was
running for student government president who might have not looked like
all of us, who might have had history and tradition that wasn't like the
majority, when one dresses in Arab garb and goes out and throws water
balloons, one needs to be able to address many of the things that were
said. If there's an opportunity to clear the air I am one who will
always listen with an open mind and an open heart. If anybody is capable
of forgiving I am certainly that person. I sought the opportunity to
clean the slate for this gentleman like the past candidate we just voted
on. I supported her. She was premminently qualified. It makes no
difference who comes forth with that recommendation. My record is clear
in terms of being able to look at the intrinsic qualities of a
candidate. Those intrinsic qualities are lacking if a person refuses to
address, when provided an opportunity in open forum or in any other
context, significant questionable concerns which we all should be deeply
moved by if we read them. Simply because they come nominated by a
specific individual then we're being remiss in exercising our
obligations.

<p id="40:00">
hearing some of the comments. In committee the other day I think it was
important that we just clear the air. Because I thought Mr. Allen did a
very good job of answering most of the questions that he was asked. I
thought he was pretty frank about what happened in college. He talked
about that. I thought he was frank about the minimum wage issue. I
thought he talked completely about that. Now there were some questions
that were asked about what someone else thought, that you were asking.
And I think our chairman asked him not to answer those questions because
you were asking him a question about someone else's thought, no his
thought. I thought it was a fair debate in committee the other day. I'm
not sure what else Mr. Allen could have said, to be quite honest. From
the questions that were asked, because I thought he was pretty frank and
honest and laid himself out there about as much as anybody could I think
under the circumstance. I don't know what you were looking for, for Mr.
Allen to say. I think you were trying to hold something that maybe
happened against him in college, against him, but again the facts showed
that he has represented employees mostly in the past few years. And not
employers. And this is an employer appointment. So you would think this
would be the type of appointment that a lot of people that want to
protect the employees would like, I guess. Because of the work he's done
for employees. I'm not sure what you're looking for in an individual,
but again, I thought the gentleman was about as frank as he could be in
committee the other day, answered the questions. He has represented
employees in the past several years of his life. Sounds to me like a
pretty good person to ask to be on this industrial commission, in my
opinion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the resolution.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President and
members of the Senate, I have rarely ever read an email on this floor
but I want to read one to you right now. Senator Hartsell, I wanted to
drop you a quick email to thank you for all you're doing to support the
confirmation of Charlton Allen for the Industrial Commission. It's
difficult when your husband is attacked by people who don't know him.
I'm thankful for your support and also thankful that this process is
nearly over. Thank you again. This was from Beth Osborne ?? a young lady
who grew up with my daughters, is the wife of Charlton Allen, and who
served on this floor as a page some 15 years ago. Charlton practiced law
briefly in Concord, in the office next door to mine. If we had to talk
about what crazy things we might have done in college, particularly
Senator Bingham, it seems to me that we would all have problems in this
place. I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there
further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Goolesby, to what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolesby has the
floor to speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. First I'm glad to learn that Senator Bingham did go to
college. Second, [LAUGHTER] class, I would like to talk about Charlton
Allen, because I do happen to know him. He practiced law in Wilmington
for a number of years. He was our local county party chairman for the
Republican Party and I know both his parents were fine people. I have
heard the vicious attacks against my friend. I was not here for his
confirmation hearing, I was on a family matter. But I am shocked and
dismayed that such a fine individual would be so Kafka-esque attacked on
the floor about things he did or did not do, and I'm glad to see that we
have a founder of the campus journal, the Carolina Review, and someone
who doesn't believe in the minimum wage willing to stand up and say what
they believe in. Those are exactly the kind of things we need from
anyone that we appoint to a position where they make important decisions
for the state. Charlton Allen is a fine individual. I ask you to please
support his nomination and vote affirmative on this reading. Thank you,
Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is passage of House
Joint Resolution 1112 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senate bill 744, appropriations act of 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brown is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President. I think many of you have read
the differences in the house budget and the senate budget. Some of those
bigger differences is the house budget takes I guess bets on the bet of
lottery proceeds to fund teacher pay. It also, in our opinion,
underfunds the rebase for Medicaid which has risen at about a 5.6% rate
yearly and we think doesn’t nearly put enough money to take care of that
rebase. Also our budget addressed the need to get teacher pay to the
national average, which it did, the house budget does not do that. Those
were just a few of the differences so I would ask that you do not
concur.
