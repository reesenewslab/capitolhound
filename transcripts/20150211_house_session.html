  The House will come to order. Members, if I could have order just a
moment. Slight deviation from the normal way we open the House but I
would ask the house to come to order. We just ask the members that
before we begin today&#39;s session, we ask that we take a moment to
remember the three UNC students who were senselessly murdered in Chapel
Hill yesterday evening. If you all would join me with that please.
Thank you.
Members may take your seats. Visitors will retire from the chamber. The
Sargent at Arms will the doors. Members and visitors are asked to please
silence all electronic devices. Today&#39;s prayer will be offered by
Representative Glazier. I would ask that the members and those visitors
in the gallery with us today that you please stand for the prayer and
also remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.
Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon and please join me in prayer. We
ask your blessings, o God, upon those who have been elected to lead and
serve our state. As we perform our duties keep us ever mindful to the
high purposes to which we are dedicated. Help us be faithful heirs to
those who have preceded us and worthy predecessors to those who will
follow. My our collective actions reflect wisdom and strength and bear
testimony to the great heritage they represent. As the newly elected
officers of this house strive to achieve their goals, may they help keep
all of us faithful to our task. Grant us all the strength when we are
weary, hope when we are discouraged, patience and perseverance when we
face obstacles. Give us health of body, vigor of mind, and serenity of
spirit. May our labors always reflect honor upon the House, the General
Assembly, and the people of North Carolina and let us all say amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of the house, this is the bill that we take up
every two years that lays out the process about which the House will
elect eight members to the UNC Board of Governors. The procedure is
similar, as I say, what you will recognize from recent years. The timing
for this will be, the nominations will be open for acceptance beginning
this coming Monday, February the 16th. They will close at 5:00 on
February the 20th. The nomination forms, and each of you has a
nomination form at your desk that was passed out, you will also receive
after session, you will receive from my office an electronic copy of
this form, which will make it easy for you to send it out for folks that
you might nominate to fill out. This form has to be signed with an
original signature and in to the principle clerk&#39;s office by 5:00,
no later, but by 5:00 on February the 20th, okay? Also at that same time
the individual will need to have filed their statement of economic
interest with the State Ethics Commission by 5:00 on February the 20th
as well. If you are renominating someone, and there are seven
individuals out of eight seats, there are seven individuals who are
eligible to be renominated, they may be able to get by with just an
update form with the State Ethics Commission, but I would request that
they check with them first to make sure that that&#39;s appropriate to
their situation. All of the instructions are on here, are on the form,
the resolution calls for the actual election to be held here in the
House on or before March the 19th and, again, it&#39;s a standard
election. You will be required to vote for eight. We could have up to 16
nominations on the ballot if the committee, if the nominating committee
receives more than 16 nominations then the nominating committee is
required to meet and to pair that down to 16 that will be brought before
this chamber and you will have to vote for eight. As I remind people,
and we&#39;ll remind you at the time of the vote, that you will be
required to vote for eight names. You cannot single shot someone. Those
ballots are signed and
