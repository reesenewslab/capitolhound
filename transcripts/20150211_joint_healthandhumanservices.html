  Thank you, members of the committee, members of the public. Welcome to
our second educational meeting of the Appropriations on Health and Human
Services Joint Committee meeting. We&#39;ll start this morning by
introducing our Sergeant at Arms. In the House we have Reggie Sills,
Marvin Lee, Terry McCraw, and Ray Cook, and in the Senate, we have
Charles Marsalis and Steve McKaig. Thank you all. We have two pages
serving with us. Welcome to the Senate this morning. We have Lindon
Noonan, that&#39;s great, representing Martin, and we have Regan Waits
under Brigadier General Gary Pendleton. Thank you. Thank you. I hope you
enjoy your week.
We&#39;re going to begin this morning hearing from the Secretary and her
priorities and others. If there&#39;s time available within the meeting,
we will pick up from the agenda left over from yesterday. We have a
presentation left to go with that, but that&#39;s dependent on our
timeline and others. We want to make sure the Secretary has a full
opportunity to lay out her vision today and hear from the committee. So
with that being said, if there&#39;s nothing for the Chairs, I&#39;ll
turn this over to Madame Secretary. Thank you for being here this
morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, good morning, and thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of
the committee, and welcome back, and it&#39;s a pleasure to be here and
see all of you. The Department of Health and Human Services is committed
to improving the health and the wellness of our citizens. The department
must serve every citizen in our state. Of those who receive the
services, and the taxpayers who actually fund the nearly $20 billion
budget in our department. During the past two years, we have focused
tremendous effort on addressing a number of fundamental opportunities to
make the department a sustainable, efficient organization. From the
beginning, we have strategically invested in creating a sustainable
infrastructure that allows us to work more efficiently and more
transparently now and into the future. At the same time, we have focused
on our human capital at DHHS. We reorganized and realigned the
department and many of its divisions to operate more efficiently and
more transparently, including a nearly complete reorganization of the
Division of Medical Assistance, and that being the first time in 40
years. With your assistance, we have reassigned existing positions in
the department to significantly, and that is significantly, expand our
internal audit staff, which really has enabled us to identify and
implement operational improvements and gain efficiencies. In addition,
we have moved forward with developing and implementing our IT solutions
that are required to serve our citizens and operate efficiently. And you
are truly seeing the results. By making these strategic investments, by
putting in the right leadership, the right workforce, and IT systems in
place, we have already a more efficient department and are meeting the
needs of our citizens. Our efforts in strategic investments have
resulted in better financial management and budget predictability.
Thanks to the humongous of the department, of the Governor, of Office of
State Budget, and efforts in the General Assembly, last year the
Medicaid budget finished that year in the best shape it has been in over
five years. After being almost $2 billion over budget

  the previous four years before that. We succeeded in creating and
implementing tools that enable us to better track and forecast our
Medicaid expenditures. These tools have improved Medicaid operations and
transparency, making it easier for the department to work
collaboratively and productively, both with the General Assembly,
Research, OSBM, and other stakeholders to make informed critical
decisions for our state. This collaborative effort, at this point, is
almost on a daily basis for us. We must continue on this path by making
continuing strategic investments. After two years of making improvements
in the Division of Medical Assistance, 2015 is the year for true reform
for our Medicaid program and reforming into one that is provider driven
and patient-centric. We must empower our healthcare professionals to use
their training, to use their experiences, to use their professional
knowledge, to provide the care and achieve measurable improvements in
patient health and in outcomes. We must set the goals, not only to be,
when we set the goals, we cannot be over-prescriptive in defining how
our providers operate. Medicaid reform is a strategic investment for the
future that will provide a return for the money invested in this program
and it is truly achievable. We must work together to develop a Medicaid
budget, one that includes strengthening our risk reserve so that it is
more comparable to the reserve maintained by other insurance companies,
including the state health plan. We must continue to enhance our IT
infrastructure so that that in our line of work, which deals with human
lives, we can serve those in need with the most efficient use of
taxpayer dollars. Our certification on-site review by the federal
government of our NCTrack system, our multi-payer billing system, was
just held and it was a very positive visit. Our CMS reviewers, our
federal partners, were very complimentary of our preparations and our
ability to demonstrate the functionality of our NCTrack system. I am
very proud that we are the first state in the nation to successfully
implement a multi-payer system and the first in the nation to be
reviewed by CMS, our federal partners, applying its new survey tools.
But most of all, I&#39;m very proud of the dedication and the hard work
of the employees at DHHS. We anticipate learning the outcome of our
certification review in approximately two months as a timeline and a
successful certification for the state of North Carolina has quite
substantial financial benefits for the state. Continuing to make
strategic investments in our IT infrastructure is really critical to
improving the health and well-being of our citizens. The greater detail
available through the new technology also reduces the waste and the
abuse in the system because it does bring greater transparency to our
programs. As you know, NCFast system, that is used by our county
departments of social service at that level, was initiated originally in
2008 and replaced 19 Legacy System, IT systems. It facilitates counties
making eligibility determination for all our benefit programs and it
also improves consistency. These eligibility determinations may

  The Department’s Vital Records section records each individual’s birth
and each individual’s death, and in some cases, the medical examiner
system may intersect here because it actually determines the cause of
death, and we have identified opportunities to make both of these
sustainable and efficient. There has been a lot of tremendous
collaboration identifying solutions to improve the medical examiner
system, an area that has long been neglected. With your assistance, we
increased the salary range for our forensic pathologists, and we
successfully recruited several doctors to work in our office of Chief
Medical Examiner, and now it’s time again for some sweeping reforms to
ensure that we have a strong, sustainable medical examiner system that
North Carolina really deserves. However, as in any case, the
strengthening of our mental health system, the strategies identified for
improving our medical examiner, really require a long-term plan. Vital
Records is another significant longstanding need for our state, and I
firmly believe that the function of the office of our Vital Records is
really the fundamental responsibility of our government, and we need to
implement – we really do need to implement – an electronic death records
system in order to simplify and improve the process and timeliness of
collecting, of registering of death certificates for North Carolina
residents and improve the timeliness of notifying the state and our
federal partners about deaths in order to prevent the benefit payments
to the deceased individuals and to decrease the fraud that happens, at
the same time to improve our analysis and response, which is critical to
the potential healthcare risks and outcomes in our state. In fact, North
Carolina’s only one of six states at this point without an electronic
death records system. We have created a plan for making this critical
investment and we appreciate your support in this matter. Together we
are responding to the most critical challenges that we face as a society
– ones that impact the health and the wellbeing of our citizens. We have
and we must continue to make strategic investments in our infrastructure
and in our human capital. Thanks to the progress that we’ve made over
the past two years, the next two years will present great opportunities
for the Department, and I look forward to working with you in that
direction. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam
Secretary. I appreciate it. We’re going to begin with any questions you
may have for the Secretary. Senator McKissick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Madam Secretary, for that overview. I was just curious; had a few
questions. In the Division of Medical Assistance, Medicaid, are you
completely fully staffed at this time or do you still have vacancies?
And I was particularly concerned about those positions where we need
people with strong financial analyst-type skills or actuaries because I
know that’s critical to that division in terms of its ability to create
accurate, reliable projections, so where do we stand? I know that you
had filled three or four of them a while back, but that would not have
been full staffing, as I recall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, thank you
for that question. We are not 100% in any part of Department of Health
and Human Services filled with our vacancies, but we’re very far along.
One, and I will take this opportunity to ask for referrals to HR, in the
field of compliance. At a very senior position in compliance, there is
still an opening. We are interviewing at this point and I request and
share that information. So on the senior leadership, that is the one
that we have not yet filled. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know when the Governor
provided his State of the State message, he talked about coming up with
plans

  And to cover the uninsured. It didn&#39;t use the term Medicaid per se,
but I did not know if your agency is looking at any models or looking at
any type of waivers in particular that would help accomplish that
objective. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, thank you for that question. Yes,
we are, we have been and we are continuing the dialogue of evaluating
all options that could possibly be to the benefit for North Carolina and
its citizens and we are working in that direction. The Governor has met
with the President directly on that and we have ongoing meetings and
dialogue in that direction. We are trying to find solutions for North
Carolina that the Federal Government would be able to agree with that
would be beneficial for our state. Every state is unique. Every state
has their challenges and we will be bringing forward to the General
Assembly once we&#39;re able to at least have some understanding with
the Federal Government that we&#39;re discussing the same direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow up if I could. And I guess it&#39;ll
be a compound question. Do you have any idea at first when that
timeframe might be that we might see something and then secondly on an
unrelated issue, I know that you recently mentioned that there was a lot
of applications that came in because of problems with TurboTax and your
agency had intervened and basically prevented folks, a problem that was
basically gonna overload systems across the United States, but does it
look like the additional applications that came in that may need to be
reviewed notwithstanding the fact that they may be incomplete or may not
be eligible candidates, is that gonna require a substantial amount of
resources to comply with that, that will create problems for us in terms
of issues we&#39;ve faced in the past with food stamps or education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator, thank you for that question. The issue
with TurboTax is obviously the state, and not just North Carolina, took
all the states by surprise and we were able to mitigate and stop some of
the applications coming in for all of them at a certain period of time,
they are now coming back to us in a different form. Based on, for those
who may not know, on TurboTax as you were filing your taxes, at the end
there was an opportunity to say you may qualify for additional state
resources in reference to food and nutritional service and if you press
the button yes then an application was populated with some of the
information from your tax returns onto an application. That application
was automatically faxed over to the county Department of Social Service.
One morning all the sudden the county Departments of Social Service
walked in to find on their fax machines collectively thousands of
applications that were neither complete nor some of them readable with
the incomplete, inaccurate information, so that created enormous
challenges as we tried to figure out where this came from and what was
unfolding. We realized that TurboTax some of the states acted very
quickly legally. We were collectively with everyone we could to try to
engage our corporate partner TurboTax. They did cease that activity and
now are filtering in through Epass, our electronic system of entry in
benefits. We stop released through USDA, our federal partners, that
these applications, neither complete nor, what do we do with them. We
were informed that we have to treat the as proper applications by USDA
even if one that we can&#39;t even read what&#39;s on the fax. That is
dangerous because that queue for us, we still have a backlog that
we&#39;re piling through on our present Medicaid applications

  and this increases the number in our backlog. And we are having meetings
on a daily basis with the counties, with the state, and our federal
partners on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does it look like there&#39;s gonna be a substantial
reallocation of resources, financial resources, as well as personnel to
deal with this, or is it. Okay. Well, that&#39;s good. The first part of
that compound question was trying to get to time frame might be for a
waiver coming to us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, perhaps I&#39;ll answer it a little bit
differently. The federal government right now is waiting for resolution
in the Supreme Court, and that decision will impact any direction
whatsoever. That decision is expected June-ish, so until then there
really will be nothing brought forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your presentation you
mentioned that one of the next big segments that you&#39;re going to go
into is the child protection case management. Can you explain to me what
your path is in getting there, in terms of what you&#39;re looking at,
how you plan to develop it, and any kind of, sort of, not
written-in-stone timeline that we&#39;re looking at?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. I think our path in general on NC Fast will be,
even originally in 2008 when it was proposed, the timeline that was
setup was pretty accurate. That from that time it was expected to have
every, that entire system by the end of 2017, and we&#39;re pretty
close, even where we are now, with knowing you we would have the ACA in
2008. Even with that we&#39;re pretty close. That by 2018, and towards
the beginning of, middle of 2018, so just a few months off that original
time frame. So the entire project, and that included the Adult
Protective Services, which is still out there. So that whole system,
where we will have transparency of information, of every eligibility and
every service through the state, for the counties and the state.
&#39;Cause the issue is, the citizen has to be able to communicate with
their county. The county has to be able to communicate with the state,
and the state with the federal government. What we need to insure that
the counties can communicate with themselves also, because in Child
Protective Services what you can see is how you make your decisions if
you need it in a timely manner. And so putting the Case Management
System inside of NC Fast will allow the case worker to see far more
information, far more information than if it is done separately. So
that&#39;s why we feel it is imperative that it is done inside of NC
Fast, and that was the original vision still from 2008. That has not
changed. Now, with what we know, we know that that is far even more
beneficial than even ever envisioned because of what we can see in
reference to protecting the children. We are actively working in
committees with our stakeholders to create this solution, but this is
the next one that we are hoping. Do we have a timeline exactly for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 24.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Child Services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the implementation of it will, according to our
timeline, on the whiteboard, and according to our original timeline, on
10/1/15 it will start, and by 9/17 for the entire project for the entire
state as far as our timeline.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? If you wouldn&#39;t mind, expound a little
bit on the development in terms of, is this going to be in-house like a
lot of our computer work connected with NC Tracks and NC Fast has been,
or are we going to look out into the sphere of the computer world and
find out where someone may have been working, maybe move the system
along faster, but still have it communicate in that county-to-county,
county-to-state, and so forth hierarchy that you referenced?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that is all being presently evaluated,
Representative Avila, and there is, on our end there is a collaborative
group that&#39;s working through that right now. And we will be happy to
get back to you with the details of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have a series of questions

  <p id="30:00">
  And I wanted to thank the Secretary for such a succinct and to-the-point
report. I really appreciate that. It’s very clear. The first question I
have is about the Medicaid. You indicated that it had been over-budgeted
by two billion dollars over the years and now you have a handle on that.
Could you clarify how you got a handle on it? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Basically in the Department it’s about efficiencies, and how do you
create a process and a workflow in order to derive the efficiencies from
the organizational part of it? How do you work smarter? And if you’re
working smarter – smarter and quicker, you’re able really to take out
some of the efficiencies, some of the process, so a lot of that is
number one, correct budgeting… tighter forecasting, tighter analysis… as
I refer to it as, paying attention to everything that you can pay
attention to, and that’s how the original efficiencies were really
driven, and that’s the path that we are on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
How are you feeling about the issue of Medicaid expansion? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] How do I feel about it? As I’ve mentioned, it is something that
we’re evaluating and we are working on. For North Carolina, we have a
substantial amount of citizens who do not have health insurance, and
citizens who do not have health insurance do not stop using the
healthcare system. They continue to use the health system, so how do you
provide health insurance for the uninsured and yet not put that burden
directly on the taxpayer and yet allow the citizens to have an
opportunity to engage in that concept? So we are working through how
would we structure a model that allows that – that allows a citizen to
take part in health insurance and have some responsibility towards that,
and yet how do we create a system that does not put the ultimate burden
on the taxpayer? And that’s the business model that we are right now
looking into and discussing with the federal government, as are other
states in this process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Next question. You talked
about case management, which I think is very critical for children and
adults in terms of protective services. What about case management as it
relates to people with mental illness, intellectual development
disabilities…? Where are we on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well some of it
is tucked into LME MCOs, that line of work, and what we have done over
the last two years in that arena is we have… we are on a path of driving
into the system standardization and efficiencies, so what we’ve done is
set the state on the path of decreasing the amount of LME MCOs for the
purpose of driving in efficiencies and standardization, at the same time
driving accountability and efficiencies – not only financial
efficiencies, but also medical efficiencies and accountability towards
the citizens that they serve, so the services are not overused, but at
the same time they’re not underused. So we have that LME MCO system. We
have an entire SWAT team that has been working on this that actually
meets in my office. At this point we don’t meet every week. We used to
meet every week; we work now with our reports every month, but we are
driving those efficiencies and therefore creating the information back
and forth as best as we can. Originally on our different LME MCO
systems, unfortunately people were on different IT systems, and as we
are consolidating we are gradually moving towards decreasing the amount
of variable IT systems, individual IT systems, which makes it quite
complicated for them and for us. So as we consolidate, that’s one of the
issues that we’re driving – some form of less variability in the IT
systems, which therefore is towards the case management. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. I’m concerned about people who don’t have healthcare
and need it, and

  Are getting sicker and sicker. I’m concerned about people who need case
management to actually move forward in their lives and I hear about it
every day. In following Bell Haven in the vital medical center, could
you give some insight on that? We’ve gotten a detailed packet on that
particular issue. Do you have any insight on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, I will perhaps ask our director of, to come back to you
?? with exactly, the exact information. I do understand you received a
quite extensive package just recently. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman
Tucker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, Madame Secretary. Thank
you for being here this morning. I do want to give you kudos, and you
and your department. I was aware of that situation on Saturday morning
with that diversion at a major medical center here in the state and they
tell me that you and the department reacted in a quick manner and they
were able to alleviate the situation so I do want to say that great job
there. Sometimes when the barn’s burning down, somebody’s got to come
with water to put it out, and you did. And your department did. Along
the lines with Bell Haven, ?? left that hospital, has anybody given any
thought to maybe converting that into a mental health hospital,
utilizing that structure, re-employing those people over there and
utilizing those rooms and those beds? I know it’s zoned ?? but if
someone could make that a profitable endeavor, if we need beds for
mental health patients. If that hospital shut down we could redeploy
those rooms and staff that’s there and perhaps do something there for
Bell Haven, just a thought on my part. Just did not know. The other
thing, back to Chairman Able, ask a question about the case management
system which childcare and foster care is what we’re about. Is there a
demo available that members of the committee could review from NC Fast
that shows us the case management system? We’ve seen other ones that are
working in other states and there is off-the-shelf product that maybe
could make it happen quicker. I guess I’m a little bit reluctant to
delve into a case management system with NC Fast in lieu of all the
issues that we’ve had with that program. So, if there’s a demo
available, if you could get someone from your department to schedule it,
I’d love to see it. And then finally, on your statements about the fact
that Medicare was this past budget cycle, was in surplus and was in the
best shape it’s been in five years. Running a 20 billion dollar business
and we’re almost in the fourth quarter of the football game here, can
you tell me your over/under budget number today? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you for that question, Senator. [LAUGHTER] To the best of my knowledge
as of today, we are on target to be at budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well,
I’m still going ?? with the financial pressures we’re under now, I
really, really do hope you do come in under budget. Mr. Chair, that’s
all the questions I have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insco.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Secretary, Madame
Secretary, for your report. It was very helpful. I want to follow up, I
have two issues I want to talk about and one is, does have to do with
Medicaid expansion. But I’m interested in knowing whether the department
has the ability to find out whether those 60 people who were in that
hospital are insured or uninsured, and it’s been my interest a long time
that we all know that we’ve had this issue with people ending up in
emergency rooms with mental illness and not having a place to go. And
also I’ve made the assumption, maybe correctly or incorrectly, that a
lot of those people were uninsured, and providers, we can’t expect
providers to provide ongoing care in the community to people who don’t
have, can’t pay their bill. And so that’s one reason I’ve really been
very interested in Medicaid expansion. And if we could document that
that would be a place that we would save substantial amount of money and
relieve our hospitals of overcrowding.

  Through Medicaid expansion, at least they would get paid and our
community based physicians then would get paid to to provide those
services. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative thank you. I was just being
handed the answer to that so we won&#39;t have to get back to you. 2/3
were insured of those patients and 1/3 were uninsured, that was the
breakdown at that time. In reference to issues pertaining to behavior
health, perhaps at the biggest level it is critical as we move forward
in the state that we stay true to the needs and it has to be a long term
vision and we all have to line to get to it. We are seeing not just
North Carolina, the entire United States, we are seeing more patients
and citizens that aren&#39;t patients yet, citizens requiring assistance
with behavioral health/substance abuse issues. Because of the nature of
that area it requires a variety of solutions. A variety of solutions
because it&#39;s individual depending on how the situation unfolds. We
should strive as a plan to provide services of prevention, treatment and
sustainability in the communities wherever we can for many reasons. Many
reasons. Community-based support systems and their multiple types
don&#39;t have to be big and huge and massive and expensive. they can be
the ones that focus on prevention and support, which sometimes are
smaller, and we have been quite grateful for your ability to allow us
financial resources last year to move forward with our crisis initiative
solutions. Now what does that mean? Yesterday I spoke at a CIT
conference, so that&#39;s where the police department and sheriffs and
people who work in public safety and corrections officers with the field
of the mental health and stakeholders, all in training. There were a
couple hundred people in this training to teach each other how to react
when you come on to a situation to de-escalate it so the person does not
end up in the emergency room on involuntary commitment in the emergency
room for several days, and so we are working in multiple arenas. We have
actually been in discussions with Chief Justice Martin and with the
Supreme Court justices in reference to possibly working on an initiative
with them under the Governor&#39;s leadership, so multiple solutions
that we have, but they have to be community based when we can. That does
not exclude the fact that there is a true need for hospital beds and we
cannot think that there&#39;s not a need. There is a need, we need our
psychiatric hospitals and we also need an ability in the community to
hospital beds. We need an ability to have more three way beds in the
communities for psychiatric beds. That will alleviate a substantial
amount of issues if we can accommodate more of that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow up on that one issue. I have heard that we&#39;ve actually
lost three way beds. Is that actually the case or are they, I mean, I
support expanding three way beds. I think that&#39;s been one of the
things that we&#39;ve done that actually made a difference and so I
think we should continue expanding those, but I was concerned that I had
heard that there was some pull back from that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, I perhaps will have Dave Richard speak to you
where we are in the state right now with that, but that was an example
of where we need multiple solutions. We have this clever program and its
not insignificant where we train students and a different program for
adults on mental first aid, and at this point we have thousands of
people already we&#39;ve trained in the state. This is not insignificant
because peer support to identify and support folks before it goes

  To a crisis is really where we need to devote our efforts because that
is truly impactful and it&#39;s quite heartwarming to see actually high
school students engaged in this arena trying to learn how to help their
colleagues. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and that&#39;s a, we&#39;re very
supportive of that approach and I have one other issue and this is a,
this is an inquiry more than a question or a comment, I&#39;m very
supportive of your efforts to expand communication for children across
county lines through your IT system or however you do it. When I was a
County Commissioner, we had trouble within the country getting division
directors to share information between the Health Department and the
Department of Social Services because of privacy issues, and so that
was, I couldn&#39;t understand it then but I&#39;m very glad to hear
that you&#39;re actually sharing information across county lines and I
don&#39;t know whether there&#39;s been an internal shift in privacy
issues or whether that was something that was more unique to the area I
worked in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, I will actually have
to actually inquire on what that problem was. I am not familiar. It has
not been brought to my attention. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And then I just have
one question for staff. I would like to get the Medicaid enrollment for
the years 2008-2014. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ll be able to find it.
Could we find the 2014 numbers? On this I currently have and I&#39;ll
recognize next Vice-Chairman Pendleton for a question then I have
Senator Van Dyne then I have Representative [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Secretary, two things. One of them, I have tried for some time to
get a state psych hospital built on Dorthea Dix property over near the
Healing Place, off to the side. It wouldn&#39;t interfere with the park.
Maybe 40-50 beds to preserve the legacy of Dorthea Dix. Have, and I
don&#39;t know, have you given any thought to a state hospital. We have
1 million people in this county. We have 150 psych beds. We ought to
have 1,100 beds in Wake County. Have you given any thought to preserving
that legacy? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wray, I think the issue of
Dix campus at this time is being handled between the city of Raleigh and
the Governor on the path that has been set. I firmly agree with you that
the legacy of Dorthea Dix and her vision for the compassion and the
commitment towards folks with behavioral disabilities does have to be
preserved and there are many ways that can be accomplished, even with
the simplest way of building a monument, a statue that we all
acknowledge the efforts of and the compassion, the vision. I, in
reference to the property of Dorthea Dix, sir, that is, that rests with
the Governor&#39;s office and the city of Raleigh and the legal
agreements that they have come to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is not a done
deal yet, and we&#39;re probably only talking about 5-6 acres. Would
you, before this is given away and the city of Raleigh buys it, which
obviously I live in Raleigh and I&#39;m in favor of it, but still 5-6, 8
acres is not gonna kill the park if it&#39;s off to the side where the
Healing Place is now. I&#39;m trying to get beds for Wake County. Would
you pleas answer that question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative,
perhaps we could get back to you with the strategic needs for beds
geographically in the state and what the vision and the proposals are
and we&#39;d love to meet with you about that on what the needs are for
hospital beds in the state and where that need is and we&#39;ll make the
appointment and meet with you on that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now my second
question is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] With the,
with what&#39;s going on with the medical examiner&#39;s office, which
is atrocious, but I know you&#39;ve done

  and some things to try to fix this, but what concerns me is these
contract hire pathologists or medical examiners that you’ve hired, your
department has hired, that they’re not doing their jobs. We’ve got death
certificates that are being written up as a suicide when they’re a
murder. We’ve got murders that have been written up as suicides – cause
of death. Have you terminated or have you quit paying these MEs,
contract hire MEs, that don’t do an autopsy? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will
have Dr. Radish get back to you on the very specifics of contracts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When do you think you could get back with those on
that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Very quickly. From
Dr. Radish, very quickly. Within a day or so she will call you, sir. In
reference to the need for psychiatric hospital beds for the state of
North Carolina, that she will also do very quickly. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a general reminder, all questions need to come through the Chair,
so thank you. We’re coming up to Senator Van Duyn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
I’d also like a copy of your report on the need for psych beds
throughout the state, please. I have a question. I live in western North
Carolina, so my constituents are actually closer to South Carolina,
Tennessee and Virginia than they are to Raleigh. When you talk about
your child protection case management system and sharing data between
counties, is there any maybe long-term vision for sharing that data
across state lines? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, that would be lovely. I
think we have to walk before we can run, but that would be the ultimate
benefit. We truly sometimes lose information on children because it’s
not transparent to us, and it’s not transparent to us who lives in the
household sometimes because of different last names and of all sorts of
things. It’s not transparent, and that’s one of the reasons why when
it’s part of NC Fast, we’re able to see all sorts of things – how many
adults live in the household with different last names… We’re able to
see all sorts of things because of the NC Fast system and if we’re
putting that into the child protective services. So there’s a lot of
information that’s needed to make correct decisions, and the more we
share it, the safer we are. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hunter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning Secretary, and
thank you for those updates. Being in the funeral profession, I’m glad
to see North Carolina finally moving towards the electronic records. The
timeliness is my concern. Funeral homes currently have five days to file
a death certificate with the Health Department, but they’re having
problems finding the right physician to sign these death certificates,
or when we pick up the death certificates, the doctors had those death
certificates filled out wrong, or they’re not filled out completely on
the new death certificate. The new death certificate is entirely
different from the last one. It is confusing for some physicians. How
are you working with the physicians on the timeliness of filling out the
certificates and how to fill them out correctly? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, thank you for bringing that to my attention. I will have
to get a little bit more information of how we can work a little closer
if that is an ongoing challenge, so we would love to meet with you,
Representative Hunter, with the folks from Vital Records, and I’ll be
more than happy to be at that meeting to make sure that it’s targeted
and on track. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Robinson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Madam
Secretary, for your report. Just a couple of thins there, and thank you
that I haven’t gotten any complaints from my providers recently about
the system, so thanks to your staff for responding to them in terms of
the issues we’ve had, and we have a new DSS director and all of that in
Guilford, so I think things are going a little bit smoother now. I met
recently though, several of us, with the Triad Mental Health
Association, and part of their concerns, you probably well know, is
capacity to serve the numbers of people, and

  this included Sam ?Hields?, as well as other providers around Forsyth
etc. in terms of real capacity. The numbers of folks who are needing
support maybe Beds maybe our patient etc., and not having that capacity.
And then there were some people there who were advocating for themselves
in terms of one lady whos husband committed suicide and could&#39;ve
received services early on so it was a real sensitive but informative
session. So my question to you is, across the state, what are we looking
at in terms of our deficit for mental health services both in terms of
impatient beds, outpatient beds, that kind of thing do we have a
comprehensive assessment of that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson I
actually would like the opportunity to meet with you or other members to
show you our vision for the state for behavioral health, it is quite
comprehensive but its not a one size fits all and i think that&#39;s the
take home message. That we have to figure out multiple solutions because
its not the right thing to put everybody into long term psychiatric
hospital, its not the right thing to keep everyone at home, there are so
many opportunities individually to get people to a safe and better place
with support systems. So i would like the opportunity to present the
different programs in our vision as it unfolds for not only for this
year and not only for this coming budget year which is critical that is
what were addressing today but to make sure were consistent as we move
forward. Perhaps we can meet with you and show you what our strategic
plan is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay follow it Mr. ?? And I&#39;m sure others
in here would like to hear that as well too because mental health is,
the other requests from them of course was if we could use the funds
from Dorothea Dix to put in mental health. And a lot of people have made
that kind of request in terms of, you&#39;re closing that hospital why
cant we use that fund to augment services and there are community based
agencies like the associations in those areas that do services as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, thank you for that, we are counting on that,
that the financial benefits of selling Dorothea Dix will be put into the
mental health system. And hopefully used inside of our strategic plan
for the state, so we are hoping for that. [SPEAKER CHANGE] One follow up
Mr. ?, mostly to you, that at some point that when the secretary is
ready to give us some lay out of that plan that we can have the time to
hear from her about that please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think were prepared
for those, I think were still, they&#39;re still in negotiation we
don&#39;t know what the amount will be and i think we&#39;ve seen today
there may be some discussions about other things that are part of that,
but i think i will say that i think its also important that we not take
the lump sum we receive and put it into continuing services and have it
evaporate in a short period of time, that&#39;s kind of coming in.
Don&#39;t have anyone else for questions so I have two that I&#39;m
going to ask I fully understand that these are probably questions
we&#39;re going to have to get back so that&#39;s okay but if you happen
to have the information. The first one would be: The DOJ settlement, you
have mentioned in your operations, do we know specifically where we are
on the number of slots filled and how that is consistent with our
agreement with the Feds and others and whether were on track to meet the
2000 mark by the deadline. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator thank you for
that, I don&#39;t have the exact number with me, I will get back to you
on the exact number. We&#39;re kind of on track, but this is a very
serious issue for our state to be able to adhere to these requirements.
And each year it&#39;s getting harder and harder we are working
collaboratively of course with multiple agencies and our ?LMNCO&#39;s?
but so far we are on target for this year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The last
question I have and we&#39;ll need every time we&#39;re coming into
budget number. Coming in you talked about positions vacant and positions
hailed, can you give us the number of positions vacant as well as the
dollar amount that you&#39;ve had open more than 6 months. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We can back to you very quickly on that, I just don&#39;t have
that with me, but yes Sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?Senator Wells? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Madam Secretary thank you for being here and for your
presentation. I want to fill into an area that&#39;s in between some of
what we&#39;ve talked about. We know we got great concerns at the state
level, about health care, and we have heard from specific hospitals

  Different counties that they would like more state resources. This is a
real complicated arena. It&#39;s easy to look at something simple like
incentives and see that 58% of the state money going to incentives is
poured into two counties but we don&#39;t have a number on how
that&#39;s working in the healthcare range, but there&#39;s some
indication that we&#39;re sucking resources out of smaller, poorer
counties and into the urban counties. Some of that&#39;s just
urbanization, we can&#39;t do anything about that. What we can do is
make sure we&#39;re not making it worse. I come from a district that has
a closed hospital, a vacant, vandalized hospital that will never be
reopened in the west. The west has not been very good at screening. We
need to address that in our own areas. Among all this data that
you&#39;re looking at, among all the things you&#39;re doing, among all
your reorganization are there any tools before us that might help direct
or keep resources in the smaller, rural, poorer counties in the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it is critical, especially in the arena of
behavioral health. In that arena it is critical that we maintain access
as close as possible in the communities. In our rural communities it is
an enormous challenge, enormous challenge to get services in the
behavioral health world and that is why we are proposing to structure
the support services and programs, sometimes even on a small level, but
keep it local. It had the ability to do that. We have enormous
challenges with our healthcare provider in the bigger picture in our
rural counties. My always biggest fear is we do not lose sight of the
need in our rural communities, that we do not lose sight of our rural
health clinics, that we do not lose sight of our Federally qualified
healthcare system that provides healthcare services for the uninsured,
and sometimes when we speak we&#39;re speaking at the bigger picture and
forgetting that in our rural communities they have different challenges
and our decisions for the bigger good may endanger them and we need to
make sure number one, do not cause harm. Number one as how we make our
decisions and that is one of the reasons why it&#39;s critical that we
also concentrate on the resources, so those resources, we have to face
forward. We have to train more healthcare providers. We have to do that
and we have to train, allow healthcare providers to work at the top of
their professional license. Two different thoughts, because if we do
that we can try to ensure that our smaller communities and our rural
communities have an ability of access to care, so for the western region
and the eastern region they have very different challenges than the
middle of the state. We are very well aware of that and as you know have
aggressively and vocally voiced our opinion and our concerns when it
comes to certain decisions so that we do not cause harm. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members, we have about 20 minutes left. Susan&#39;s
presentation&#39;s expected to be about 15 so whether we get to it
I&#39;ll leave up to the committee members as kinda their going forward,
but Senator McKissick, a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one real
quick. Madam Secretary, back in November there was an issue brought to
my attention by some of the hospitals, particularly the smaller ones,
where they were concerned about the reduced rate of reimbursement for
those they were taking in on mental health issues. You know, if they
stayed in the hospital and they got a bed, you know, that was fine, but
otherwise the level of reimbursement was going to be dramatically
reduced. Has that issue been addressed or resolved or do you know where
it stands at this time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Very specifically, Senator, I
will have to get back to you, but the problem for the healthcare
community is the reimbursement rates are continuing to decrease. As we
know, the primary care physicians in North Carolina as of January of
this year have had between a 23-24% pay reduction on their
reimbursement. There comes a point in time where it&#39;s very difficult
to have a sustainable business model in this arena.

  <p id="65:00">
  And it is critical that we keep that in mind, not to endanger the amount
of healthcare providers as we’re looking at cost-cutting measures. And a
lot of the rules on payment, also for the hospitals, it’s just not the
Medicaid arena. Of course, our Federal regulations with the Medicare
world also impacts them very severely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If someone could get back with me, if you or Adam, or Dr. Denning, or
whoever… it’d be appreciated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you Madam Secretary.
Susan, if you would like to go ahead.
We cut it close for you. We gave you six days to get it in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
While those handouts are going out, this is the second part of the
presentation we started yesterday. You also received two additional
handouts which we did not bring. You have copies of two Fiscal briefs.
These are the documents that we produce every year after session is
over, that gives you the highlights of all the budget actions you’ve
taken in Health and Human Services during that session and those
documents lay out not only the major actions that you’ve taken, but at
the back of those documents are charts by division with historical
budget information that we typically present in committee. But you can
find these online and you actually got hard copies of them yesterday. It
has two years of actual, for last year, it has three years of actual
expenditures and then what the certified budget was. So for each
division within HHS it has how many positions are in that agency, the
actual expenditures, and actually what the certified budget is for the
current Fiscal year.
So very quickly going into a budget overview for Health and Human
Services, the first slide is the statutory authority for Health and
Human Services. Each agency and department has the statutory authority
set in law. Based on the conversation that we had in the committee room
yesterday, I would suggest that if you go in the direction of moving
toward funding outcome based programs, at the end when we wrap up all of
our educational briefings, you might want to come back to your statutory
authority and make sure that it is still in line with what it is the
general assembly has a vision for this agency. Particularly focusing on
the last bullet, I wanted to point out since we talked so much yesterday
about preventive measures that one of the department’s goals is to
establish priorities for careful planning of preventive services. And
so, the last time this statute was actually revised was in 1997. The
secretary has already talked about her organizational structure and this
is for your information how her department at the secretary level is
organized.
So Health and Human Services, this is the certified budget for the
current fiscal year, for 14 – 15.
5.2 billion dollars. 21 billion dollars is the size of your total state
budget, general fund budget, that’s the money that comes from general
purpose revenue and does not include federal or other receipts. It is
only the general fund portion of the budget. It is what is included in
your money report every year and the document that accompanies the
budget bill when you debate the budget bill that goes to the Senate and
House floor is roughly 21 billion dollars. The portion for that that is
Health and Human Services is approximately 5.1 billion, 24%. Education
is the one sub-committee, one area that has a larger percentage and
that’s at 56%. Justice and Public Safety at 11%, and then you see the
remaining committees significantly smaller with Natural and Economic
Resources, General Government, and then your State Right Reserves and
Capital at 5%. This is the chart that gives you the same information I
laid out for you in the table in the preceding document, but you will
see that Mental Health is 680 million dollars is 3% of the total state
budget at 21 billion dollars. All the other agencies make up about 4% of
the state budget with Health and Human Services, again, equaling 24% of
the total state budget.

  <p id="70:00">
  And of course, this is what we spend the majority of your time,
historically what we&#39;ve talked about in subcommittee, and when you
get your target, this is, this is where we go to try to help you find
reductions when you&#39;re given a target smaller than you&#39;re
spending the current fiscal year in the governor&#39;s budget. This is
the areas that you focus on to try to find those reductions. What we
wanna talk about more and what we talked yesterday was focusing more on
the fact that health and human services has a total budget that is
almost the size of the total state budget, which is $19 billion. You see
Medicaid is still the lion&#39;s share of this budget at roughly 14
billion with social services having more funds in total than mental
health does at 1.7 billion. Mental health is roughly 1.4 billion,
followed by public health at $827 million. You can&#39;t read this on
the overhead, but you do have a summary chart, and this document ties
more closely to the briefings that I, the other two documents I
referenced when I started, and it shows you in summary how you&#39;ve
changed, your net legislative, your legislative net changes over the
past two years, and this was in 13-14, so your last long session, when
you did a biennial budget this is what, what you enacted for health and
human services. So if you look, if you look at that column, the
legislative net changes, it shows you how you changed the governor&#39;s
recommended continuation budget. And on a net basis, you increased his
budget by $378 million. I will tell you that buried in that number was
$434 million for the Medicaid rebates. So this is a misleading number
because there are reductions, a lot of reductions built into those net
legislative changes. Now, for the next two meetings we&#39;re gonna go
over specific changes item by item that were made in the subcommittee.
So we&#39;ll talk more during the next two meetings about specific
reductions and specific expansion items, and the status of those items.
That&#39;s the plan for the next two meetings. So we&#39;ll get into the
detail of these net legislative changes, but I did want to point out the
amount of the net rebate, of the rebates for Medicaid 13-14 was $434
million which is included in that net $378 million increase. That budget
that in 13-14 was increased by 8.2% for 13-14, and your second year of
the biennial budget, you increased the budget by $507 million, or 11%
compared to the governor&#39;s recommended budget. Included in that $507
million was $557 million for Medicaid and the rebates. Then last year in
your short session you came in and made adjustments to that biennial
budget. You increased the health and human services budget by $10.4
million and included in that $10.4 million was an additional $136
million for the Medicaid program nonrecurring funds. Separately from
that included in the reserve section is $186 million for Medicaid
contingency reserve. And mister chair, that&#39;s a high level overview
of the changes that have been made to the health and human services
budget over the last two years, and as I said, we&#39;ll get into the
details of specific cuts and expansion items that have been included in
these numbers in the past two years, and that will be most likely the
next two meetings, next two committee meetings that we have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and Susan, on the, on page 13 you started with how, the
percent of the budget. I think, I&#39;m not sure exactly what is for the
division of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance
abuse services. We used to have all the money for the state facilities
in that budget. Can you tell us now what is in that budget, have we
moved that money out, or is that money still with the state facilities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, in the $680 million, the facility money is still
in there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then, and then the, where the, where you have the services? State
funded services?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma&#39;am. So the $680 million includes the services and the money
for the facilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse, and could you have her break that down? Does she know what that
is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, Denise Thomas, fiscal research. Representative Insko,
about 340 million is for community services, but that includes about, I
think, between 75 and 80 million of federal funding, so net of the
federal it&#39;s more like 250 that would be state general fund money
for community services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and just, at some point, I&#39;d like to review, when we get
into the budget details, how that fund, the state dollars for mental
health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services, how,
how this

  trajectory over the last seven or eight to ten years. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, for the Division of Mental Health, you’ll have
four years of history in the brief that we gave you yesterday, but if
you want it broken down, we can provide it to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Vice Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I address Mr. Jacobs? Would you go
over with HHS while they’re here about us switching from just paying for
services versus outcome investing and how we’re going to want to be
briefed on that as they go along? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair and
members of the committee, from the Secretary’s comments, it sounds like
she’s talking about pretty much the same thing that you are. She
referenced investing in Health and Human Services even when she talks
about Medicaid, so I’m not sure of that. What the committee’s talking
about doing is not in sync with what her vision is for Health and Human
Services, but I won’t speak for that. I will back up to the earlier
slides and talk about what we were talking about yesterday, and that is
a focus again away from counting things in this committee to talking
about outcomes, and we were going to invite the Pew Center in. HHS is
familiar with the Pew Center and how they have helped states look at
programs to figure out what the return is on an investment in a program
and the fact that even though we’re spending more of healthcare in
America, not just North Carolina, it’s not necessarily syncing up with
better outcomes, and the Secretary knows that. She’s quite familiar with
that, so this is not anything new for Health and Human Services. I guess
what is new is the fact that we are... for this long session, I will
point out for the Health and Human Services that we are planning to
focus on children 0-5, and so children 0-5 will be the focus, and so
we’re going to look at programs in North Carolina that are focused on
reducing infant mortality, improving birth outcomes, and so we’ll be
working with the School of Public Health, with the Division of Public
Health – the Division is already aware; we’ve already contacted some of
their staff and involved them in these presentations – and your Division
of Social Services. So it will be a united effort to provide you
information, but her staff were here yesterday when we made the
presentation, so I would assume that they were aware of the new
direction that we were going in. That’s about all I would be able to say
on that, unless the Secretary has comments about the new directions the
committee’s moving in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Farmer-Butterfield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was wondering if you all have
already in place a comparative of the certified general fund budget for,
like, the last five or six years in terms of the total percentages by
subcommittee areas. Could we get that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair,
Representative Farmer-Butterfield, I think out budget development team
has that and we can get it for you. We’d be happy to get that to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman Avila. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually Mr.
Chairman, this is more of a question for you. Would you please direct
staff to disperse all of the information for the request to the complete
committee? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you like ?? disperse ?? Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Ms. Jacobs. Come forward. I’ve been asked…
Chairman Pate wanted to address before we adjourn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
I’ll just take a second. With the discussions when the Secretary was
addressing us, a question came up about Vidant Hospital down in Belhaven
being converted over to mental health – beds, sort of procedure – and I
just wanted to let people know that Vidant does not own the Belhaven
Hospital building; it has been turned over to Pantego Creek LLC. That
occurred during the negotiations with the town of Belhaven, so that puts
another cushion in there as to where we would have to go if we decided
to look at that facility to upgrade it to a mental health facility.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, members of the
committee. I look forward to as we continue this process moving back
forward, and having reached our hour of adjournment, we will stand
adjourned.
