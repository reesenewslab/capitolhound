If I could have your attention please, chair would like to welcome all
of our guests today. The members of our committee will be arriving in a
very short time as we have just adjourned on the house floor. Take care
of a little housekeeping prior to the beginning of the receipt of the
testimony. First of all, out these doors directly in front of the chair
guests may find both restrooms and also a water-fountain. We also have
water and coffee in the rear of the room. Chair understands that there
are also guests present in room 544 which is one floor down from here
and I extent them welcome as well. Each speaker received a number as
they signed-in. Speakers will be called in groups of ten to que up along
the white side of the room. When the Sergeant at Arms holds up a sign
then the range of ten including your number please move to join that
line. Speakers who are not in line when called will be moved to the back
or the end of the list. If you are seated in room 544, the Sergeant at
Arms in that room will also indicate when a new group of ten is being
called so that you can move up to room 643 at that time. Because seating
is limited, after speaking if seating is no longer available in this
room or if you would like to make room for other individuals you may
also listen to this public hearing in room 544, one floor directly below
this room. The elevators to get to that floor, again, are directly out
this door and on the chair's right. Each speaker may speak for up to
three minutes. Sergeant at Arms is directed to keep time and we will
hold up signs indicating when your time has nearly expired and your time
has expired. In order to accommodate the maximum number of speakers, the
audience is respectfully requested to refrain from applause or other
commentary on speaker remarks. Each speaker and members of the audience
are asked to maintain order and civility in presentation of their
remarks. Individuals who disrupt will be escorted from the room by the
Sergeant at Arms staff. The chair would like to point out that the
testimony that is presented today is being transcribed by a licensed
court reporter. This transcription will be made available to all people
who request it and we will put a link to the committee website to help
facilitate that. With that I know that you are here to offer you input
and advise on this important subject and the chair regrets that we are
delayed for only a few moments while the members make their way from the
house floor. So with that the chair would ask for everyone to just
please remain in their seats and we will begin in just a moment.
[Speaker Changes] Little bit dramatic but some people believe that being
as careless about who is buying a weapon is as dangerous as being
careless about who is casting a vote. I happen to be one of those
people. Thank you. [Speaker Changes] Thank you Ma'am. Speaker number
three did not sign-up. Speaker number four, Maria Gay, Maria Gay, you
have the floor Ma'am.</p>

<p id="005:00">
Speaker 1: Good afternoon. Thank you for this opportunity to speak to
this committee. My name is Maria Gaither (??) and I am a certified
public accountant with over 24 years of experience, including 10 years
as an auditor. As an auditor with Deloitte and Touche, I learned to
evaluate internal controls, identify areas of risk and propose solutions
to mitigate risk. Our current election laws create areas of risk for the
potential for voter fraud. I'll give you an example. I can go to any
polling location in my county during early voting, provide the names and
addresses of my neighbors, obtain a ballot in their names, and vote.
This would be illegal, but the chance of being caught are slim. An
affective way to mitigate that risk is to require a valid photo ID
issued by the government such as a North Carolina drivers license, other
cards issued by the DMV for non drivers, a US Military ID, or a US
passport. In 2012, I served as a poll observer for the primary general
elections. I observed people of all ages and races come to the polls to
cast a ballot. Many of them had their driver's license in hand even
though it was not required. One of the early voting sites I observed on
multiple days was the Talley Student Center at NC State University. Here
I saw hundreds of students go through the voting process and most
students had their ID in hand. If a student can successfully navigate
the college application process, I have confidence that they can obtain
a valid North Carolina driver's license. The proposed bill provides
funding for a driver's license for those who qualify for financial
assistance. The proposed bill allows for some college IDs to be used in
leiue of a driver's license which should be removed from the bill along
with the employee identification card. An employee identification card
and a college ID do not mitigate risk because voters address is not
included. I have my employee ID, it has my name and a picture, doesn't
say where I live and it can be fraudulently prepared in some cases. An
expired driver's license should be permitted to senior citizens but not
all ages because the DMV had weak internal controls in the past for
issuing the driver's license. As a reminder, nobody can buy certain
types of over the counter medication, such as Sudafed, without a
driver's license, military ID, or passport. Certain prescription
medications, for example many pain medications, have the same
requirements. You can not buy these medications with a college or
employee ID. I'm sure people of all ages, races, incomes, and party
affiliations have the need for regulated medications, so why haven't we
heard about the hardships caused by the strict photo ID requirements for
those important purchases? The proposed bill has been watered down from
the bill passed in the previous session. Now is not the time to go
wobbly. Now is the time to do the right thing, to strengthen the
integrity of our voting process in North Carolina, make the proper
additions to remove the employee and college ID cards and pass the bill.
Thank you sir.
Speaker 2: The chair thanks you ma'am. Speaker number 5 did not sign in.
Speaker number 6, Mr. Hardley. You have the floor, sir, for time not to
exceed 3 minutes.
Speaker 3: Thank you for allowing me to speak today. My name is Herb
Hardley (??). I'm from Sims, North Carolina in Wilson county. A couple
of weeks ago I went in to a Starbucks coffee shop to buy a gift card for
my daughter's birthday. I didn't have any cash with me so I used my
credit card. The waitress there asked me for my photo ID before she
would ring that up. Consider some of the things we require a photo ID
for: applying for a job, driving, buying a car, registering your car,
applying for medicare and medicaid, applying for social security, bank
transactions of all kinds, boarding an airplane, going to a doctor's
office or a hospital, even here in North Carolina, if you want to hunt
or fish, you have to show your ID to get your license, buying and
selling scrap copper, cigarettes, and of course using your credit card.
The list goes on but I think you get the point. Every citizen of North
Carolina of legal age has or can get a North Carolina issued ID, it's
called a driver's license. Those who do not have a license, can with
proper identification, apply for one from the North Carolina DMV and it
doesn't cost much. Across the country and in North Carolina, voter
fraud, in all its various forms, has grown with every single election
cycle and photo ID is the answer. Photo ID can prevent and deter
impersonation fraud at the polls, voting under fictitious voter
registrations, double voting by individuals and voting by illegal
aliens. At the last election cycle in 2012, I voted and now</p>

<p id="010:00">
One person in the polling place knew who I was or asked me to prove who
I was. That should simply not be the case. I've seen statistics that
show the majority of people in this country including many Hispanics and
minority groups support voter ID laws. I'm not going to bore you with a
bunch of numbers. Voter ID laws already exist in many states and have
been upheld as constitutional by courts. Even Mexico, as corrupt as it
is, requires photo ID and a thumbprint for you to vote. This is probably
the most important part. Every fraudulent vote that is cast, even if
it's only one fraudulent vote, dilutes and calls into question the
integrity of the entire vote tally and the trust a citizen from North
Carolina have in the voting process that it is honest, transparent, fair
and impartial. One person should have one vote and that person's ID
should be verified with the current, non-expired, color photo ID before
they cast their vote. It doesn't get any more complicated than that. In
conclusion, our constitutional republic demands an honorable election
system. Voting is serious business, much more than driving a car,
cashing a check or buying a cup of coffee. I urge you to vote in favor
of a non-compromised photo ID voter law for North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair thanks you sir. Speaker number 7 Ms. Jade.
The Chair apologize on mispronouncing your name but you have the floor
for a time not to exceed 3 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, my name is
Becca Jade and I live in Wake County. Many opponents of voter integrity
justify it by denying that there is no vote fraud in North Carolina but
we respectfully disagree. Recently in the last election they compared
the Florida and North Carolina voting records and found that Teresa
Murray of Guilford County she is currently being investigated for
interstate voter fraud. Another case was Robert D. Moore of Mecklenberg
County. He died on August 13th of 2007 but somehow managed to vote on
November 6th in 2012. There's another case recently that is being
investigated by the Buncombe County Board of Elections and it was with a
voter named Kelsey Carol Heitzman and she appears to have voted
illegally by exploiting her vision of the law called One Stop Voting or
Same Day Registration. According to the Buncombe County Board of
Election documents, Kelsey Heitzman registered to vote on October 28th
2012 at an early voting location. During the board's routine follow up
mail to this voter they were unable to make any further contact. This
leads us to believe that a crime has occurred. One voter was
disenfranchised because of this particular vote which was stolen. As of
February this year that voter was coded confirmation not returned. If
just these cases were the only ones and most of us would just shrug our
shoulders but it appears that this is a pattern of fraudulent voting and
in Buncombe county there were 63 other voters who got away with this
same type of voter fraud and and all those votes were counted. What was
the impact of this? Well their county commission's race was decided by
18 votes. Just 18. So there's no doubt that real voter fraud changed the
outcome of that election. While voter fraud would not have ?? by vote ID
real voter ID may have deterred the perpetrator from attempting the
crime that we are alleging. While some will deny or downplay the cases
of fraud, I ask you how many voter's votes should be allowed to be
stolen. Just one is too many. So the people of North Carolina deserve to
have laws with reduce election fraud and this is your chance to get it
right. So I ask you to remove the voter fraud friendly loopholes in our
election fraud and get real voter ID in North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair thanks you ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen as a
point of clarification you may wonder why I call out the numbers of

[SPEAKER] And aware that numbers 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and 13 are not
here. Therefore, Speaker Number 14 is Mr. Mark Slide.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s not you. The Chair apologizes. Which number is
he?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair would like to ask Speaker 14 to come up and
to, please, state your name, and the Chair will scratch it off the list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, my name is John Pizzo, and I’m the Research
Director for the Voter Integrity Project in North Carolina where I lead
a research team of 23 dedicated fellow citizens who challenge the
erroneous notion that voter fraud does not happen in North Carolina. On
the contrary, our research has shown it is wide spread and pervasive. It
takes many forms. It’s getting worse and will likely continue to get
worse until existing loop holes are closed.  As a non-partisan
organization our research does not take into account gender, race, age
or party affiliation. We simply look at the facts.
There are various ways that fraud is committed that we've identified,
which is multiple voting within state, which is impersonation voting,
which is non-citizen voting, which is felons voting, which is
post-mortem voting, which is dual state voting , to name a few.  I have
a data table from the Board of Election that shows that they charged 400
voters in the period from 2004 to 2009 with voter fraud. They were
referred to district attorneys who never prosecuted a single case.
Apparently, for those who commit fraud in North Carolina, there are no
consequences.
Now, many would be surprised to know that undocumented immigrants can
obtain a voter registration card by simply checking a box that says, I
am a citizen. Knowing that the state does not prosecute cases of fraud
only in embolden such activity. Now, for some numbers, last year we
found 28,000 deceased voters who remain on the voter roles in this state
years after their death. Despite the lack of a Social Security Number
and a date of birth, we are confident that our accuracy rate is in
excess of 97 percent, and the counties where we filed challenges it was
a hundred percent. I’m getting the short . . . I have a lot more about
voter fraud but I’m going to skip to the end of my remarks.
I do want to mention that the same day registration and voting is a very
serious issue. In the County of Waco alone, there are still 406 voters
who took advantage of same day registration voting and cannot be found.
One wonders if they even exist.  I wish I had more time to go into the
many irregularities and provable voter fraud in the state that we've
uncovered. None of us have ever received a dime for our efforts, and as
I reflect on it, that is a good thing. No one in this state, including
the ladies and gentlemen sitting in front of me, should ever accept
voter fraud either as a method to skew election results in their own
favor or anyone else’s without taking legislative action to close the
loopholes, audit the system, correct what’s wrong with it. And to those
out there who continue to deny voter fraud problems exist in North
Carolina, refute our date or stop lying about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair thanks you, sir. And for the record, Mr.
Pizzo was signed up in slot number 13. The Chair misspoke and the Chair
apologizes for that. The next speaker will be Ms. Katie O’Connor. You
have the floor, ma’am, for a time not to exceed the three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank  you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Katie O’Connor
and I’m a staff attorney with the Advancement Project, a non-partisan
national civil rights organization with the Voter Protection Program in
North Carolina. I have three minutes today and I want to dispel three
myths.  The first is that no one is affected by these laws. Nothing
could be further from the truth. I’m going to tell you a couple of
individual stories about the people who are disenfranchised by voter ID
laws, like that in HB 589. There was a law suit in Texas regarding the
Voter ID law there. And the court heard testimony from the</p>

<p id="020:00">
Victoria Rodriquez, A Latina student who didn't have a driver's license
because her mother's car insurance would have increased if she's gotten
one. She had a student ID and she was able to use that for everything
including getting on a flight to D.C. to testify in that trial, but that
ID wouldn't have been sufficient for her to vote. When South Carolina
sought for clearance of it's voter ID law, several impacted voters
intervened to tell their stories. Amanda Wolfe, for instance, had
trouble locating her birth certificate because she was adopted. And when
she was finally able to get that document she was told she would need
her marriage license and divorce decree in order to get an ID. Each of
these steps took a lot of time and money and attorney assistance that
she didn't have. James Devos and Junior Glover, two African American men
from South Carolina both lacked an original birth certificate
altogether, and would have to require attorney assistance in order to
petition for a delayed birth certificate. Similarly, the lead plaintiff
in a case challenging Pennsylvania's voter ID law actually marched with
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Macomb, Georgia during the 1960s, and has
voted on a regular basis since she became eligible. Nevertheless, this
93-year-old African American woman has never driven and has never had a
driver's license, had to make three attempts to get her birth
certificate and was finally given an ID after that.
The second myth I want to dispel here is the justification for this law.
We know that there is not. Actually, actually we know that there's not,
and we've heard a lot about that but there is one more thing I want to
talk about with the people who are impacted by these laws. We know that
in Indiana in 2008 21% of the ID related provisional ballots went
uncounted. Twenty-one percent of those ballots were not counted because
people couldn't show up to show ID. We also know that in 2012, 22% of ID
related provisional ballots. . . I'm sorry. That's 22% were counted. I
mean 78% were uncounted. Finally, we know that in Georgia 1,586 votes
have gone uncounted since that state adopted an ID law. That's 1,586
votes too many, for no justification. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am. The chair is not aware that speakers
14 or 15 have signed in Speaker 16 is Mr. Mike Benyon. Sir, you have the
floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. My name is Mike Benyon. I'm from Wake
County. I would like to add one more voter integrity example here and
then address another issue. Consider the recent case investigation by
the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina. It featured a voter named
Viral Patel. This person of interest provided ?? his non-U.S. citizen
status to the North Carolina court system after voting in an election.
According to their own document, the Wake County Court Clerk of Courts
received evidence from Viral Patel that disqualified her to vote –
disqualified the voter forum jury duty on the basis that not being a
U.S. citizen. The actual date of the jury disqualification was not
9/4/2008 but a vote was recorded in this person's name on 11/2/2004. I
repeat, the vote occurred before the jury disqualification date, so we
view this as a clear case of voter fraud, and in respect to
disenfranchised voters, that is they cannot require an ID suitable for
voting, I suggest that we're addressing the wrong rules, or the wrong
laws, and that should be made available to anybody who needs a voter ID
because it is critical that our votes have integrity and not a matter of
circumstance. So, if a person cannot get a voter ID I suggest that we're
looking in the wrong places to correct the issue and we should be
looking at what's preventing them from getting but keep the integrity of
our votes in place, because I don't want to give up my vote to somebody
who's not legally voting. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair thanks you sir. Speaker number 17 has not
signed in. Speaker number 18 is Jonathan Bandy. You have the floor sir
for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Good to see you Mr. Chairman.

<p id="025:00">
Carolina and I am here to represent the North Carolina Federation of
Young Professional Republicans. I’m here to offer today some reason to
the liberal arguments that you have heard during this entire process.
Liberals are trying to convince the public to oppose voter ID laws by
arguing that there are scads of people that would be disenfranchised or,
if you will, suppressed, if they were required to present some form of
government ID in order to vote. I have a lot of trouble responding to
this argument because it is very short-sighted. First, very few people
lack photo IDs. This includes the objectively poor, many of whom who
need IDs to qualify for government programs designed for their benefits,
including welfare and benefits. Second, there’s an endless range of
activities for which photo ID is required such as driving, purchasing
alcohol or cigarettes, purchasing a firearm, picking up a package,
renting an apartment, picking up a prescription, enrolling in college,
cashing a check, and I can go on and on and on. Third, the race card
argument. Voter ID is not suppressing minorities as well as other groups
that are supposedly unable to comply with these simple regulations.
There is nothing racist about a procedure that can help prevent people
that aren’t citizens or who aren’t legally registered from committing
fraud. Analogies between voter ID and Jim Crow poll taxes are completely
absurd. While segregationist laws sought to create fraudulent results,
voter integrity laws have the opposite goal. What is racist is the
notion that an African American and a Hispanic voter who don’t have an
ID are incapable of getting one. So why are liberals really so opposed
to these laws? I believe liberals are opposed as to the same reason
conservatives are in favor: They’re both inclined to believe voter fraud
is happening. The difference is that voter fraud benefits liberals. I’ve
seen myself how relatively simple it would be for me to commit voter
fraud. I have a roommate and he doesn’t vote that often, but I could
simply show up and say I’m him and vote twice. So let me finish my words
by stating the obvious: Ensuring the integrity of our electoral process
should not be a partisan issue. All citizens must be allowed to vote,
but  it is totally reasonable as well as constitutional and feasible for
all qualified voters to be able to prove their identity. I hope you
enact the voter ID law that requires government-issued voter
identification that has not expired. I know my generation needs a
restored faith in the voting process and a restored confidence in our
elected officials. If you want to take a step to change young people’s
voters’ apathy, this is your first step. If you support voter ID,
members of the committee, I ask you to join with your fellow citizens
and sign our petition at ISupportVoterID.com. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The Chair thanks you. The next speaker who is signed up is
speaker number 22, Mr. John Garish. You have the floor, sir, for a time
not to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. I am John
Roanoke Rapids in Halifax County where I have lived most of my life with
the exception of nine years in military service, so I have observed the
process of voting in Halifax County for most of my life. I have observed
it as a voter, a poll observer and most recently as a chairman for the
Halifax County Republican Party. Now I’m here to tell you that voter
fraud is alive and well in Halifax County. This fraud is not hard to see
because it’s a very blatant matter in which some of it is done. Some
would have you believe that voter fraud does not exist, but I cannot
accept that. Am I to believe that Halifax County is the only weed in the
tomato patch? I believe that when someone has trouble remembering their
address and starts making guesses as to where they live, that a voter
photo ID might even help that poor soul find their way home. I do not
wish to distract from the seriousness of this situation; I merely wish
to get your attention. Voter fraud is a crime, and when left
unchallenged, destroys the integrity of the process and disenfranchises
people from voting, especially honest voters. I can give you many
examples of voter fraud, but the one that troubles me the most is the
abuse of the rights of those unable to even realize their rights are
being abused. I speak of the mentally disadvantaged. We had one parent
coming to us seeking advice when he realized that his chronologically
adult daughter who spends most of the week in a care facility was taken
to vote. She has the mind of an eight-year-old, and her father has spent
a lot of money and time and effort to get guardianship for his daughter,
so this was a surprise for him when she voted, and upon talking to her,
he realized that his daughter who had just voted</p>

speaker number 25, Debbie Rainer. I apologize I mispronounced your name
ma'am. You have the floor for a time not to exceed 3 minutes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'm just a mom. I'm a mom that values honesty and integrity. I
try to teach my kids to always be honest and live their life with utmost
integrity. I took a lot of hours out of my extremely hectic day today to
drive here because I believe that these particular values are under
attack just simply by our current voting system. I've always voted but I
never really paid attention until this past election how easy it would
be to cheat. I stood outside the polls, especially in early voting, and
just watched people. What I observed was utterly appalling. I saw one
man drive up who clearly could not sit by them self, was clearly not
coherent, was quite elderly, could not stand, somebody came out to the
car, the man driving held the person's hand, made her sign the sheet and
voted for her. I watched this happen. Again, I am just a mom and this is
just one example. I could go on and on. I then watched others walk up
and just give their address to vote. And I thought, anybody could say
that they were me. Anybody could walk into another precinct and say they
were somebody else. I could do the same thing. As long as I knew
somebody's name and somebody's address, I could go vote for them. Then I
realized if one person did this, my vote was invalidated and that's not
fair. That's not fair to me and that's not fair to my children that are
coming behind me. They are waiting, they are watching for the values of
honesty and integrity of the people that are running this state. I
realize that there's - I seem to be living in a situation where this
society doesn't seem to believe in the honesty and integrity that I do.
Having to show identification to exercise this precious right to vote is
the only logical way to make sure our system in North Carolina would not

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I'm a volunteer in Raleigh for the Voter
Integrity Project. We are fortunate that we do have the right to vote
but with rights come responsibilities. Voters have the responsibility to
prove they are eligible to vote. Voters are used to proving their
identity as other speakers have talked about and I do agree with
removing college ID and employer ID from the law. I would like to
discuss the argument that fraud is not an issue in elections. There are
signs that it is big business. Representative Dave Lewis reported on the
floor of the North Carolina House in the 2008 election 91,000 North
Carolina voters had their registration confirmation mailing returned as
undeliverable. 91,000 people were not where they said they lived when
they voted. This raises a big red flag. In North Carolina, President
Obama won the election that year by about 14,000 votes. But the 2012
election there were approximately 14,000 returned voter registration
cards for Wake county. There are figures that this is much larger and
the Voter Integrity Project will be investigating this for the many
suspicious unverifiable same-day registrations from this election. The
Civitas Institute has documented that the North Carolina State Board of
Elections  conspired with a private company working for the Obama
campaign to facilitate</p>

A form of online voter registration for the 2012 general election. More
then 11,000 people were allowed to register online in violation of state
law. Just before Easter President Obama signed an executive order
establishing the Presidential commission on election administration
which will consider the number, location, management operation, and
design of polling places, training, and recruitment, the number of poll
voters, the efficient management of voter roles, and poll books, voting
education, and voting accessibility for individuals with disabilities,
limited English proficiency, and other special needs. The President is
already campaigning for Nancy Pelosi to return as Speaker of The House
in 2014. We also need to be ready in 2014. The voter schemes continue to
change and become more sophisticated. We need photo voter ID to
effectively document eligible voters, prevent fraud, and increase public
confidence as other speakers have said. It is easier to prevent fraud
then identify it after the vote is already cast. It's time for voter ID.
President Obama is going to be ready for 2014, and so should we. I do
understand if federal law prevents us from meeting this type of a
timeline in 2014. It's time for the North Carolina government to be
accountable, thank you.

Mr. Chair, distinguished members of the legislature, my friends, and
other fellow citizens of this fine state of North Carolina. In late 1776
this nation was formed to allow you all to pursue life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. If that pursuit of happiness happens to be that
you're gonna liberate my TV set from my bedroom there's regulations
against that. Even my right to free speech this afternoon intentionally
and responsibly is limited to three minutes. Voter fraud is just, is
insidious as that. Instead of the recent case investigated by the Balkum
County, county board of elections. It featured a voter named Robert
Joseph ?? the second. This person of interest appears to have voted
legally by exploding provision of the law called one stop voting, or
same day registration. According to their own documents Balkum County
board of elections Robert ?? registered to vote on 10/22/2012, as an
early voting location. During the board routine mail follow up by this
voter they were unable to make any further contact, this leads us to
believe that a crime was committed. One voter was disenfranchised
because another voter stole a vote, just like the TV set. And as of
February this photo was coded confirmation not returned. If only one
voter did this type of fraud we'd shrug it off, we probably all would.
But there's 63 counts in Balkum County and it was already mentioned just
to repeat it again, the margin for the county commissioners was only 18
votes. Certainly it leads us to believe that somebody was elected
illegally. I want to remind others who may have been here in the other
hearing. I remember there was many more people saying that we were ??
and thieves, and so forth, but they happen to have enough money to bring
free buses from Charlotte to protest a voter law. It seems to me it took
less time and less money just to drive into the driver of North Carolina
Division of Motor Vehicles and get a registration. The one good thing
about this provision I am currently holding in my pocket, my permanent
ID. It will expire post 70, hallelujah I will look young forever,
younger. And I will remind all that, my wife last summer was overcome by
heat, two summers ago I tried to take her to the northern wake hospital,
I showed my ID, I showed my insurance, I'd showed Medicare card, they
would not admit her until she showed her picture ID, and she could
barely hold her head up. It's time we change this, we need to protect
the rights of all citizens and I thank you for this opportunity to
speak, thank you.

Mr. Chairman.  Thank you members of the committee, I appreciate the
opportunity to be here.  I look at this at a little different direction
when I hear people speak of voter suppression. I am a small business
person and I travel all over the state and I think the fact we don't
have voter photo ID's suppresses the vote.  I talk to people in
businesses that I do business with every day and they don't vote because
they say well what does it matter, my vote doesn't count because someone
is going to show up and vote and there is no reason to prove that they
can or can't legally do so.  I think we need to tighten up this process.
 I think we would see a higher turnout once we have a requirement
because I think that our fellow citizens would feel more comfortable
that their vote would count once.  Thank you very much for your time.

The Chair thanks you, sir.  The next speaker known to the Chair is
Speaker Number 53, Art Wilson.  Welcome, sir. You have the floor for a

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The right to vote has been belabored, the value has gotten little
notice.  A constant fact is that without absolute identification of a
voter, nothing prevents the democratic rule of one person, one vote from
being violated.  That is the power, the value of a vote.  A vote open to
manipulation is ?? political exercise.  There are four steps that must
be taken.  Photo ID is the first step in protecting voter ID integrity.
Is it perfect?  No, but it is infinitely better than the IDs that can be
produced by a child in middle school and taken that way and it is a step
in the right direction.  Abolishment of same day registration voting,
that's the most direct route to fraud.  It is physically impossible to
verify a registration in the time allowed before the voter is officially
reconciled.  And yes, illegal votes have been done that way, our County
District Attorneys have just made little or no effort at prosecution.
Provisional ballot jurisdiction must be limited on election day to
precinct not county.  As provisional ballots numbered so they can be
retrieved for verification.  Our state Board of Elections ruled voter
within a county could vote provisional ballot in any precinct.  That has
to be changed.  Registered voters in the wrong precinct be directed to
the proper location.  Just in Wake County over 4,000 of these
provisional ballots were made that wind up with 60% of them being
rejected because of errors, it created havic with the precinct officials
trying to do their work, extra hours of the staff, loss of a lot of
dollars just for nothing.  College students are not citizens like
everybody else.  Preferential legislation permits registration at a
college or university to become valid residency.,  That has to be
challenged.  That automatically is two votes for a student.  So what if
casting your vote becomes a little more difficult, ?? security of it?
We are not playing bingo, we are trying to vote, we are preserving our
legacy and protecting the next generation.  Thank you, Ladies and
Gentleman.

Thank you.  My name is Alexandra Brown, I go by Sammy.  I have a
wonderful husband, Rick and three beautiful kids and they are the reason
I am here.  I used to teach here in Wake County and the first time I was
in this building, was with a group of teachers, we had teacher training
at St. Augustin's College and we came down here about a bill and that
was pretty much the extent of my political involvement until last fall
when I decided to start volunteering.  I volunteered as a poll observer
for early voting.  One Sunday, for the first one and one half hours of
my four hour shift, so many people were coming in, that had so much
trouble recalling their address and it made me really start to wonder.
I was standing near the voter registration, same day table, I didn't
even realize at that point that you could register to vote and vote that
same day and I was standing near there and an elderly woman came up to
me, she was accompanied by a young man and she asked me if she had to
register in every county they went to.  I was speechless, I wasn't
allowed to speak anyway but in my heart I was so dismayed</p>

I was just writing in my notebook, I don't know why I bother to vote,
what is going on here?  I just didn't realize the corruption that I felt
I was seeing and I wondered if I should even bother to vote or do
anything at all.  Well I guess I did decide to do something because I am
here but I'd like to say that we live in a country that has seen many
generations fight for freedom and no one should be denied the right to
vote.  Our elections should also be free. They should be free from
intimidation, they should be free from fraud and they should be free
from corruption.  Otherwise there is no point in elections and we don't
really live in a free society.  I'd like to make three points about
Voter ID.
1.  Voter ID will curtail fraud and corruption in elections.
2.  Voter ID makes life easier for disadvantaged voters who don't have a
form of photo ID. Without photo ID, anyone is at a distinct disadvantage
in our society.  Voter ID allows the use of 21st century election
systems.  We don't live in the 1700's, the 1800's or the 1900's, we live
in the 21st century.  As for the cost the government can certainly
figure out how to get a Voter ID photo into someone's hands.  We
currently have voter ID cards, registration cards, mailed to every
registered voter and no one even needs to present them when they vote.
We need to add photos to these Voter cards and actually use them.  Is
preserving our free elections not worth it?  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair thanks you, M'am.  The next speaker is Speaker Number 57,
Laura Gutman.  Welcome M'am, you have the floor for a time not to exceed

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  My name is Laura Gutman.  I am a pediatrician.  I have been
a pediatrician for over fifty years and in North Carolina for over forty
years.  I am also a judge for the Board of Elections and I come because
of my concerns about the way the elections are currently being
implemented.  I have heard a great deal to the effect that there is not
voter fraud in North Carolina. I happen to share the opinion that my
fellow citizens are by and large a very moral and law abiding group of
people and I appreciate that since of confidence in our fellow citizens,
however, as a pediatrician I am here to tell you that it is a very bad
thing to provide a very attractive temptation to people to engage in
illegal activities and because voting is so important and currently,
very, very important, having weak voter laws such as we currently have,
is a major temptation,for otherwise persons who would be law abiding, we
are all fragile humans and we can all be tempted as we all know so this
is an intolerable temptation to our fellow citizens and we should not be
putting up with this in any way.  As I said, in general, I think that
things are well with our citizens, however, I would like to bring to
your attention a particular case which I feel is egregious. Cardoza
McColllum was born in June of 1924. This occurred in Durham County, by
the way, my home and died in August of 2002.  Either this person's
identify was stolen and Cardoza voted.  Remember, Cardoza died in 2002.
Cardoza voted in 2003. Cardoza voted in 2004. Cardoza voted twice in
2008 and Cardoza voted twice in 2012.  The last three times that Cardoza
voted was by absentee ballot which I view as one of the particularly
attractive means of subverting somebody else's vote. Now I want to point
out as others have, that every fraudulently classed vote, expunges,
destroys, obliterates, wipes out, nullifies, undoes and extinguishes the
legitimate vote of somebody who feels otherwise. I wonder if anybody in
this very distinguished room would like to volunteer to have their ??
vote.  I don't see any hands.  Thank you.

[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair. My name is Margaret Smatanne from
Orange County. What is at stake today is the right of people the people
to govern. Guaranteeing the right of eligible citizens to vote and
preventing non-eligible persons from voting is critical in governing the
country or state. These orders determine the fate of North Carolina or
United States. The question is whether we the people will rule ourselves
or have others will rule us. Some say North Carolina has fewer
incidences of voter fraud now. So why enact measures now. Prudent people
put safeguards in place now to prevent illegal voting and to secure
legal elections. Parents teach their children how to cross the street
not because their children have been hit by a car before but to prevent
them from being hit by a car. Some say that voter photo Voter Id would
disenfranchise the poorer minority. However not requiring effective
Photo Voter ID carries an even greater risk of disenfranchising all
eligible voters as their votes are diluted or negated by votes of
ineligible voters. For those who do not have acceptable Voter ID, photo
Voter Id s must be available free of charge. Provisions must be made to
assist those eligible voters having difficulty in obtaining photo Voter
ID. I request that you to legislate an effective photo Voter ID and
other measures to ensure legal elections. Thank you

[Speaker Changes] I feel it’s a real privilege to be here. And I really
thank you for allowing me to participate. My name is Jerry Stone. I am a
resident of Wake County and I have been for the last 30 years. My
opponents of voter integrity tend to justify their view by denying the
existence of voter fraud in North Carolina. But I would differ. Consider
a recent case investigated by the Buncombe county board of elections.
The feature of the voter identified as Monica [??] This person of
interest appears to have voted by employing the provisions of law called
one stop voting for same day registration which were really getting
pushed last year. According to their own documents Buncombe county board
of elections; Monica Avery registered the vote on 10/30/12 at an early
voting location. During the boards thorough routine follow up nailed to
this voted, they were unable to make any further contact. This leads us
to believe that a crime occurred. Obviously we don’t know for sure. One
voter was disenfranchised because the other voter stole her vote. As of
February of this year, the voter was quoted confirmation of return.  And
that’s one voter in Buncombe County. But that doesn’t affect us here.
But if only one voter did this sort of fraud, many in this room would
just shrug their shoulders. But his voter appears</p>

veteran of fraudulent voting because there were 63 other voters in
Buncombe County who got away with this same type of voter fraud.  And
all of their votes counted.  What was the impact?  Their county
commissioner's race was decided by 18 votes.  Only 18.  So there is no
doubt that real voter fraud changed the outcome of that election.  I
want to testify to the fact that I have voted for more than 40 years,
and at every voting site, all they asked me was my name.  And they
looked it up on the voter board to see if I was registered.  And that
was the extent of any identification.  They took my word for the fact
that I was who I was.  I don't call that very good voter registration.
While voter ID would not have prevented the fraud, real voter ID might
have deterred the perpetrator from attempting the crime, we are
alleging.  While some fraud deniers downplay such causes of fraud, I ask
you, how many votes should be allowed to be fraudulent?  Just one is too
many.  But this Buncombe county race only needed 18.  It looks like they
got it.  I hope you'll get it, too.  The people of North Carolina are
fed up with election fraud.  We only have one chance to get this right.
So you must remove the fraud-friendly loopholes in our election laws and

time not to exceed three minutes.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.  I'm Vicki Boyer, I'm from Orange County.  In our country,
everyone is innocent until proven guilty.  Voter ID requirements say
everyone is guilty until they can prove themselves innocent.  We are
blessed to live in the first nation-state founded upon an idea.
According to the Declaration of Independence, the idea of America is
that legitimate governments derive their just powers from the consent of
the governed.  That consent is gained through the process of voting.
The act of voting is a sacred American right that says government is
accountable to the people.  ID requirements say people are accountable
to the government.  Voter ID says that each of us must have the consent
of the government to participate in America's greatest ritual.  This
requirement changes the very nature of the American compact.  It
replaces voters in charge of government and puts government in charge of
voters.  It allows for a future when one group in power can limit voters
to those who will keep that group in power.  As good Americans, I'm sure
none of you would ever want to see that happen.  If you fear voter
fraud, increase the severity of punishment for those who vote
fraudulently.  Fund our local boards of elections so that they have the
resources they need to fully monitor elections and voting rolls.  Fund
our prosecutors' offices, so that they have resources to investigate and
prosecute anyone violating election laws.  Punish those who actually do
wrong, not those who don't.  Voter ID diminishes our sacred pact.  Voter
ID diminishes our democracy.  Voter ID is wrong.  Don't punish the vast
majority of North Carolina's citizens by requiring voter ID.  Don't
invalidate the philosophy this country was founded upon.  And remember
that as government, you here in this room, we validate you, not the
other way around.  Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The chair thanks you,

phrase, I'm paraphrasing a little bit because at 65 your memory gets a
little clotted when it's the truth. And I speak the truth folks. The

it will disenfranchise some of their special voting blocks. I tell you

You've got to many ways for them to get their ID. You've got the
schools, school ID, Navy tech ID, college community campus id's,
employer ID's. None of those verify the residence of that person. And
now we're to the touchy issue when your bill goes to the senate. And I
ask you to consider this, why does a student who lives in Rhode Island
or Florida or anywhere else have the right to be in a tax subsidized
school in North Carolina, living in a tax subsidized dorm, being a tax
deduction for his parents. Even if he lives in Wilmington and he comes
to UNCA in Asheville, what gives him the right to vote in that town that
he's not a resident? Address the residence issue. That is where you have
your problem with many votes. Voting twice as I told you. I'll be fine
on my time sir, but the county commissioners only give me three minutes
and I'm good at it. Friend of mine going to Western Carolina had his
daughter pulled aside and said you need to register here to vote here

section 163-82.7A. Start at line 33 on page 3 of the first edition. An
affidavit is mentioned near the end of subsection C. Is it safe to
assume that the affidavit in subsection C is an affidavit pursuant to a
subsection A or subsection B declaration? Subsection C says that the
affidavit must be a sworn affidavit. Why is an affirmed affidavit not
permissible? Does the objection that is the basis for a subsection A or
subsection B declaration have to be an objection to all photographs? Or
can it be an objection limited to government mandated photographs only?
The spokesman for the voter integrity project so called have defined the
adjective anecdotal. They tell you about what they're going to tell you
but they never tell you what they're going to tell you and what they do
tell you they tell in such detail that they can't demonstrate any bodies
in the cells or even prosecutions. By the way the biggest number I heard
from any of them even alleged was number five from the first speaker Mr.
Delancy. Proponents of voter photo ID like to recite the litany of
transactions that already require a photo ID. They would leverage
existing usurpation's of individual sovereignty to justify the new one.

show an ID card? Maybe my names Bill Ayers, I'm a terrorist and a felon,
but I want to vote. How do you know? Have I shown you an ID card yet?
No, so you have to take my word for it. There was a report done in 2010
by a lady named Susan Myrick (??), not related to Representative Susan
Myrick. In 2010 she did a voter thing on voter fraud. It seems that
there were 110 people- excuse me, 2,660 people that voted in 2010 that
were over 110 years old. That makes North Carolina the ?? capital of the
world. We must be doing something right in this state to be living that
long. Now, there's another element called voter integrity project. They
did a little looking at the rules and it seems that 30,000-plus people
that were dead voted in the last election. Without voter ID, how can
anybody tell who they are? I mean, I just walked up and told you I was
Bill Ayes or Hugo Chavez. For the record, my name really is Carey Ausner

it's part of our duty as US citizens to vote, and I've seen people that-
let me see, they've risked death, they risk dying to come and vote, yet
a small portion of our population actually come up to vote, and then we
get a whole bunch of them who show up that are illegals. They're not US
citizens and they're not voting for what we want. They're taking away
from what we want. They're trying to steal from us. Those opposed to
voter ID want unfair and illegal elections. They want to be able vote
multiple times, they want to steal. They want to direct how our country
goes, not as myself as a citizen, but what they want me to do. Not what
the rest of my fellow citizens want, but what they want to do. They want
to steal the election from us. Those that are fighting voter ID, it's
been talked about here before. How do they buy cigarettes and alcohol?
How do they cash their checks to get their food stamps? They have to
show an identification. Voter ID has nothing to do with race, creed,
sex, or color, or anything else like that. It all has to do with the
liberals or those trying to steal the election, that want a legal
election. As for the transportation problem, I've heard it before,
&quot;Oh, what if I don't have transportation to get an ID card?&quot;
Well, it's only a problem if you have a solution. Other than that,
you're whiney. The solution is, hey, I work for the Tea Party, call me.
I'll drive you down there. I'll help you get your ID card. If you don't
have transportation, give me a holler. You want my number? I'll give it
to you. I'll show you my ID card, by the way, and I'll drive you down
there. Thank you for hearing me out.

views by denying the existence of voter fraud in North Carolina. I
respectfully disagree. Consider this recent case investigated by the
Buncombe County Board of Elections. It featured a voter named Jamie Lynn
Binscroft (??). This person appears to have voted illegally by

Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair thanks you ma’am. Speaker number 82, Marian Pennway. Welcome
ma’am. You have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Marian Benway. The North Carolina
black legislative caucus stands firmly against the voter ID bill,
arguing it disenfranchises poor and minority voters who are more likely
to lack photo ID. Poor and minority voters do not lack photo ID because
they cannot apply for government assistance without a photo ID. In
California and Illinois, just to name a couple of so-called blue states,
in order to apply for welfare, food stamps, or public housing, you need
a valid photo ID to prove your identity to get government assistance.
The exact government programs designed to help the poor require photo
IDs. The information being pushed by the NAACP claims this is a poll
tax. It is not. Voter ID is consistent with the 24th amendment, section
one, which is to ensure that the right of citizens of the United States
to vote in any primary or other election for president or vice
president, shall not be denied or abridged by the United State or any
state by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax. Section two
of this amendment says, legislation is allowed which will enforce this
provision. The North Carolina legislature has worked conscientiously to
avoid disenfranchising citizens or engaging in voter suppression.
Alternative ID cards to vote are a driver’s license, military IDs,
Department of Motor Vehicle ID cards and passports. For those unable to
purchase these cards, they will be provided at no cost to eligible
voters. For the elderly who may not have state issued birth
certificates, other options have been provided. Given this, voter ID
cards are anything but a poll tax. There is no malicious purpose for
asking a person to show an ID and prove their identity prior to voting.
States like Georgia have enacted programs for free identification cards.
Turnout among black and hispanic voters increased from 2006 to 2010,
dramatically outpacing population growth for these groups over the same
period. As far as student IDs being a form of ID to vote, this is not a
good ID. Getting a fake student ID is much too easy. It was easy way
back in the 60s, well before computers, when I had one in order to get
into bars when I was underage. The only thing voter ID suppresses is
voter fraud. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair thanks you, ma’am. Speaker number 83, Larry Hanson. Welcome
sir, you have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My name is Larry Henson and I’m from Wake Forest. I’m here to
ask for your support for voter ID. In the 2004, 2008, and 2012 elections
I served as a poll observer. I’ve seen fraud and I’ve seen suspicious
activity that implied voter fraud. One example, I watched a lady come in
to vote three times. On the second time, I pointed her to the chief
judge. The third time, I again pointed her out to the chief judge, this
time the judge looked into and saw that the lady was trying to vote for
a man. When questions, she replied, you’re trying to deny my neighbor’s
right to vote. She was voting for someone else. So asked for your
support for voter ID to help keep this lady and others from committing
fraud. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair thanks you, sir. Speaker number 84 is Dennis O’Donnell.
Welcome sir, you have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your time. My name is Dennis O’Donnell, I’m from Wade
county. I come before you just as a citizen whose discouraged with our
voting system. I served as a poll observer in a 2008 election and
realized from that experience that I was being disenfranchised. I only
was there part of the day, but on election day at three o’clock in the
afternoon, all of the observers from both sides, the Democrats and the
Republicans, got to look at the voter precinct list and see who hadn’t
shown up. I noticed the four Democratic observers copied down several
hundred names in a matter of 15 minutes, got on their cell phones,</p>

And called somewhere, and approximately 30 minutes later, people started
showing up with pieces of paper in their hand, and, either written on
their hand or in their hand, of who they were. And I brought this to the
attention of the chief judge who basically said, if they say that's who
they are, that's who they are. And there's no way to check it. We have
no way of knowing what went on but it certainly left me with the idea
that my vote didn't count. Because we cannot really verify who really is
voting, who's not voting. It's critical to have some way of making sure,
we want everybody to vote, but we only want them to vote once, and when
we register them, we want to make sure that people don't register twice.
That's part of the scheme, that people register, people without their
middle name, with their middle name, and there's no checking going on.
And as one other issue, I spent this morning at the DMV renewing my
driver's license and I had to bring my passport. They wouldn’t count my
current driver's license as ID. They required either my passport or a
registered copy of my birth certificate to renew a driver's license. And
their paperwork that you get online, if you can look online, you'll see
what they require. Yet to vote, we don't require any of that. I thank
you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair thanks you sir. Speaker number 85, and the chair will apologize,
Bob, if you would state your name sir, the chair does apologize. We're
glad you're here. You have the floor for time not to exceed three
minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My name is Bob Baddisher. I'm from South Port, North
Carolina, and I drove up here today to offer a confession. I've
attempted voter fraud. Here's how it went down. On the first day of
early voting, I went down to the South Port Senior Center to vote. I
waited in line for 40 minutes. As I approached the registration table,
before the attendant looked up from completing the last registration, I
announced myself with the name and address of my next door neighbor, who
I knew was out of the country and not likely to vote for some time. When
the attendant looked up, we both burst out laughing. It seemed like the
attendant is a good friend who knows both me and my neighbor. My
attempted voter fraud was all in good fun, but when this scenario is
played out in other voting locations across the state, it's not a joke.
Well after I exercised my privilege to vote, I noted that the Senior
Center was also offering flu shots that day. I stopped in the room next
door and asked for a flu shot. I was instructed to sit down and produce
my photo ID driver's license and to give up my most critical piece of
information, and yours too, social security number. I could not have a
flu shot without complying to that request. Now I haven't heard any of
my anti-voting ID activist friends protesting the flu shot ID
requirements.  Could that be because dead people don't get flu shots? Or
because live people don't try to get more than one flu shot? It seems
ludicrous to me that we require positive ID for so many things in our
lives, yet we don't require positive ID to participate in the most
fundamental privilege which drives our Democratic republic. You may have
noticed I'm a Yankee by birth, but I'm a Tarheel by choice. In other
states that I've voted, you had to sign a book each time that you voted.
Your signature was then compared with the signature that you provided
when you first registered to vote. It seems like a reasonable
requirement to me. A photo ID would be even better. Well while my
attempted voter fraud was only a joke and no laws were broken, it proved
to me how easy it would be to carry out real voter fraud. It's your job
to make laws that protect voters from identity theft and see that only
those eligible get to vote</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair thanks you sir. Speaker #86, Charlotte Sandry. Welcome. You have
the floor ma'am for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for this opportunity to speak. My name is Charlotte Sandry,
and I live here in Raleigh, in Wake County. Many opponents of voter
integrity tend to justify their views by denying the existence of voter
fraud in North Carolina. I respectfully disagree. Consider a recent
case.. Consider a recent case. It featured a voter named (Un Baiyun
Shein). This person affirmed that he was not a citizen of the United
States to the North Carolina court system after voting in an election.
According to their own documents, The Wake County Clerk of Courts
received evidence that, from (Un Shein) that disqualified him from jury
duty on the basis of not being a citizen. The actual date of the jury
disqualification was November 14th, 2011. But, a vote was recorded in
that person's name on November 2nd, 2004. The vote occurred before the
jury disqualification. Evidence was turned over to the Board of
Elections, but they didn't seem to care. Not only did they deny all
challenges by using hearsay evidence, The North Carolina Administrative
Office of the Courts quickly moved to deny access to similar jury data
from other counties. The State Board of Elections appeared to be more
interested in derailing the investigation than they were about the fact
that a Non-US Citizen voted in our elections. This is just one example
of voter fraud in North Carolina. We have heard many today. While some
groups suppose (oppose) any credible election reform by attacking the
messenger, I believe the facts should stand for themselves. I strongly
urge legislators; You have only one chance to get this right. Please
remove the fraud-friendly loopholes and give North Carolina a real voter
ID law. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair thanks you ma'am. Speaker #87 has a beautiful signature and the
chair apologizes that (we) can't read it. Would you please introduce
yourself ma'am and then you will have three minutes to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity. My name is Molly Schubert and
I'm from Wake county. I'd like to share with you a recent case that was
investigated, as you've heard also from several others, from Buncombe
County. The board (…) by 18 votes, so each vote does make a difference.
I have a question for everyone in this room. Has anyone ever broken into
your home? Ever? A few of you, perhaps. For most of you, the answer is
probably no. Another question. How many of you lock your doors before
you leave your home? Since no one has broken into your home, why do you
lock your doors? Shouldn't you just leave them unlocked and wait to see
if anything bad happens? We never had anyone break into our home, but we
do lock our doors. Has anyone ever voted in my place before  using my
name and address? No, but should I wait until someone does vote in my
place before taking any precautions. I believe it is my duty, and my
responsibility as my a citizen, to protect my home and my right to vote
by taking preventative measures to assure that my vote is not
compromised in any way and at any time. I am honored to prove my
citizenship and proud to display a fence of civic responsibility by
showing a photo ID when I..</p>

Both. Aren't you. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chair thanks
you, maam. Speaker #88. Bill Bryson. You have the floor sir for a time
not to exceed 3 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, my name
is Bill Bryson. I live in Wake county, and I'm a volunteer for the Wake
County Republican Party. My responsibility as a volunteer is to download
the current voter list from the state board of election. As of Saturday
April 6th 2013, there were 61,858 incomplete voters in Wake county. An
incomplete voter is one who does not reside at resident address in the
voter list as determined by the US Postal service when mail is returned
undeliverable.
Of the 61,858 incomplete voters, 12.2% voted in the 2012 general
election. Of those 6,940 incomplete voters, only 1.7% cashed a
provisional ballet. Even though an incomplete voter should vote
provisional. The point here is that with the voter ID, a positive system
of identification, not a subjective system, that person with an
incomplete status, would have voted provisional so that his address
could be verified and updated if it's valid. The current North Carolina
voter registration verification system is broken. It is not aggressively
kept up to date. Which allows for abuses. Of the 714,732 voters
registered in Wake county, only 81%, 585,628, were considered complete
or active. The votes of the remaining 19% can be easily voted by using a
another person's name typically at a one stop site where the voter is
unknown. 44% of the incomplete votes casted in 2012 were cast at one
stop sites. The opportunity for fraudulent votes is rising. When newly
registered are considered active without proper identification. There
are currently 4,598 of these newly active voters. In other words, who
registered at a one stop or registered at the office, for which
verification is pending.
Of these 4,598 voters, each people who voted in 2012, who voted at one
stop, have failed successful delivery of the first or second mailing.
Now this number is increasing each time I download the database. A month
ago it was only around 2,000. Now it's 4,598. The reason is, is that the
validation process, which was not performed at the pole, at the, is
performed after the fact. And this is what causes the number to come up.
We need a positive voter identification system which is verifies the
voter at the time of the vote. Many people can register. But that person
needs to be validated at the time he votes, or she votes. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chair thanks you, sir. Speaker #89, Jessee Brenley.
Welcome, you have the floor for the time not to exceed 3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon, my name is Besse Brantley, and I live
in Wake county. And through this whole course we've been hearing a lot
about Buckram county. And I do have another one, it's Sarah ??. Again,
she registered to vote on November the second, and she voted, and
apparently her voter confirmation was never returned. So I don't need to
go into the same thing over again. You're very familiar with the story.
Basically, she stole somebody's vote because, by her voting, somebody
else's real vote did not count.
And you're all clear about that. I do want to speak from personal
experience. I've been a volunteer at the elections for several years now
and I've gotten to know a lot of people that volunteer and I want to
speak about a couple of cases that I'm very familiar with. And this last
election a friend of mine, who went into a precinct to be a pole
observer, that night before we all had received</p>

Information about the statute, about who is eligible to vote, the
criteria of what makes a person eligible to vote. That day I took that
information with me and my friend went to this early voting polling
place and he brought the statute which he presented to the judge there.
The judge took it and said that she would have to call the main office.
Well, after a little while she came back and she told my friend that he
needed to leave. She had spoken to Gary Sims and after discussion with
him my friend had to leave. He was a poll observer, he was there to do
what he had committed to do and that is to observe. There are a lot of
things that have happened over the past few years and we're all aware of
it and I know many people are trying to push it off as, &quot;Oh,
discrimination.&quot; Well first of all, I'm Spanish. My family and I
came from South America in 1964. My parents sold everything they had.
They got the legal papers to this country. We came with just our clothes
and we went to Illinois. In 1975 we became naturalized citizens. We did
everything legally. It took hard work. What I'm talking about this
election, the reason we need voter ID is, as a naturalized citizen, as a
citizen of this country, it's appalling to me how easy it is to cheat
the system. The system tries to be very gracious with everyone, yes
everybody has the right to vote. I agree, everybody has the right to
vote. But as everyone else has mentioned before, you need IDs, picture
IDs, to do so many things that are part of our regular lives. I believe
that we need to maintain the integrity of the elections by requiring
everyone to have a voter ID. And if they need help to get somewhere,
there are many of us that would be glad to. I would be glad to pay that
10 dollars to help someone get a voter ID. I'm sure that there are many
other people that would be willing to do the same. I really would
appreciate it if you would vote, and again this bill is watered down,
but we do need a real voter ID in North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Two things to you, ma'am. Speaker number 90, Bill
Clark, is that correct, sir? Welcome. You have the floor not to exceed a
time of three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. One of the most
precious rights we have as citizens is the right to vote and the idea of
one vote for one qualified citizen is critical for maintaining the
integrity of our election process. There is no debate, voter fraud
exists. Youtube videos document it, poll observers witness it, those who
oppose this bill will claim there is no significant concrete evidence
for voter fraud. That is becoming more and more untrue everyday thanks
to the hard work of many organizations. Truth be known if we had real,
strong voter ID requirements we would actually be able to prove it. Yet
without some form of voter ID and verification, we cannot have any
confidence that our citizens have cast their one and only vote. Still in
the mind of those that oppose this bill, the needs of one person without
proper ID seem to outweigh the need for the vast majority of our
citizens to have a voting process of the highest integrity. We should
all be held equal under the law. Should those who cannot or are unable
to obtain a valid ID have any greater right than citizen's votes that
are nullified by fraud? Or are we to believe that the government is
incapable of establishing a system to provide identification to those
people who do not have other valid means of identification? And finally,
we have private organizations with a long history of helping our fellow
citizens and the less unfortunate among us. Are we to believe that these
people could not act then to help those folks that do not have IDs to
get it, should a system of government of alternate IDs, not be able to
succeed. Voter fraud exists and must end if decisions made by people at
the ballot box are to go unchallenged in the wait for those among us
desiring justice. Pass this bill, thank you.

The right to vote in your state are issues, was not an issue until a
person of color became president of the united states. Be quiet I'm
still talking.
I'm marching forth for civil and voter rights in the early 1960s.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Ma'am, if you will, the chair Paula Jah says to you I think that there
are those in the crowd who perhaps are trying to lend support and to
perhaps dissuade what you were saying the chair announced prior to the
start of this that we were not going to engage in that, and so the chair
would ask that those in the room please show respect and decorum for the
speaker who has the floor. With that, the chair will direct the sergeant
to add on to add two minutes to this time. And the chair does apologize,
ma'am, you have the floor.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you, I was marching forth for civil and voter rights in the early
60s. I was spit on and called names that I can not repeat, and also
arrested. Fighting for these rights, and to think that now, in 2013, we
have to again fight to have the privilege of voting. This legislation
would take us back 50 years and a lot of people died for these rights.
You say that majority of people are behind the implementation of a voter
ID, I could say majority in the early 60s also did not want integration.
And I want to thank you for your time.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The chair thanks you, Ma'am. Speaker number 93, Lynn Baker. You have the
floor, ma'am, for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
My name is Lynn Baker and I am from ??? county. And I am here today
because, I can be here. I am happy that I am able to tell you how I feel
about the voter ID bill. I have been called a bigot and a racist because
I support this bill. But I've lived long enough to know that I can stand
up for what I believe in because this is America. And I come from a
family that's diverse, I have attended churches that are diverse, I have
worked in workplaces that are diverse. And being a bigot and a racist is
not a part of my makeup. I believe that if you are honest and want to
present yourself as being who you are, there's nothing harmful about a
photo ID. I just, I'm 75 years old. If I needed to have an ID I would be
able to find where it was, and how to get it. If I couldn't get myself
there, I would find someone who could get me there. I just think that
this is an excuse for not wanting to have one vote for one person. Thank
you for your listening.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The chair thanks you ma'am. Speaker number 94 is Alison Riggs. Ma'am,
I'm glad you're here. You have the floor for a time not to exceed three
minutes.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you, sir. My name is Alison Riggs. I've spoken before this body
before, but I've come today to oppose house bill 589. This is not a
compromise or moderate bill. After the phase-in, North Carolina's voter
ID requirement would be amongst the most very strict in the nation. In
many ways, the law is even more restrictive than those in Georgia and
Indiana. In Indiana, indigent voters aren't forced to spend the
significant amounts of time and money necessary to track down birth
certificates from out of state in order to get a photo ID. An indigent
voter may go to the circuit court clerk after the election and sign an
affidavit that he was the person who voted on election day and he is
unable to obtain proof of ID without paying fees. The indigent voter's
vote is then counted. Requiring second trips of voters is burdensome
enough, but at least in Indiana there is some mechanism whereby people
like Rocky Reese, who testified at the last public hearing don't have
their right to vote predicated on their ability to track down an out of
state birth certificate. But in North Carolina, the proposed bill
contains no such mechanism. House bill 589 is not a compromise or
moderate bill. In Georgia to get a free ID there is more flexibility in
the kinds of non-photo identity documents you can show in order to get
the free ID. In house bill 589 even with the fee waved to get the
&quot;free ID&quot;, there are very few types of identity documents that
the DMV accepts, and that would make it substantially harder to get a
free ID in North Carolina than it is to get a free ID in Georgia. House
bill 589 is not a compromised or moderate bill. It is also worth noting
that a federal judge in joined enforcement of Georgia's first version of
Georgia's photo ID</p>

<p id="110:00">
the 2005 version, because in that version, in order to get a free ID a
voter had to sign an affidavit swearing that he was indigent and that he
could not pay the fee for the ID card. The judge found merit to
plaintiffs' undue burden and poll tax claims because voters would be
understandably reluctant to swear under penalty of perjury that they
were indigent given the subjectivity of that term. And voters could be
too embarrassed about their inability to pay to request such an
affidavit. The Georgia Legislature had to go back and correct that,
changing it so that anyone who wanted a free ID could get one, and all
they had to swear to is that they didn't have another kind of ID.
House Bill 589's Financial Hardship Affidavit requirement for a free ID
creates the same legal problems that's identified in Georgia's initial
Voter ID law. Issuing free ID's only through the DMV licensing offices
is another fatal flaw in this bill. The DMV offices in many counties are
only open once or twice a week during work hours. If voters have to
choose between earning a wage and obtaining documentation to vote, that
is neither legal nor constitutional.
House Bill 589 is bad policy. House Bill 589 violates constitutional
guarantees and voting rights laws. It doesn't make elections more
secure, but it makes voting a fundamental right a lot harder for those
of your constituents who are least able to bear the added burdens.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The chair thing, she meant.
Speaker number 95, Bill Gillkerson. Welcome sir, you have the floor for
a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chair and Members of the Committee. Before I retired I
used to work here, but I also worked on Election Day as a precinct
official. I miss that sometimes, but if the bills being proposed now go
through, I wouldn't want to work as a precinct official on Election Day.
I believe these changes will make these changes will make doing the job
the voters there deserve much harder, maybe impossible.
To get the full picture you have to look at the changes all together,
not just one-by-one. For example, two years ago you drew redistricting
plans that split an unprecedented number of precincts. That means that
on Election Day the precinct officials have more, different kinds of
ballots in the same precinct and they have to make sure the right ballot
gets to the right voter. In the 2012 Presidential Election the stress of
that was relieved by early voting. Early voting sites are better set up
to handle split precincts. Because so many people voted early in 2012,
the polling places were not mobbed on Election Day. But now you're
proposing to cut a week out of Early Voting.
The Election Supervisor of Leon County, Florida told you last week that
a similar cutback in Florida resulted in a nightmare on Election Day.
One bill I saw here recently even proposed restricting early voting to
the County Board of Elections office. No more satellite sites. If these
things happen, expect longer lines on Election Day. And on top of the
split precincts, and the long lines if you curtail early voting, you're
burdening precinct officials with administering this photo ID bill.
First they have to determine if each voter has proper form of ID, which
is not always simple or bright-lined. And if there is a proper form of
ID, they may have to determine if the photo reasonably resembles the
voter.
On page 3 of House Bill 589, it says if one precinct official raises an
issue, the three precinct judges would have to stop what they're doing,
let the lines back up and have a mini trial right then and there in the
polling place. On paper, it looks like a fair trial, but this is not a
suitable environment for such a proceeding. Most precinct officials
don't like to be at odds with each other or with the voters. They have
been trained to avoid time consuming unseemly controversies by using
provisional ballots. The message has been, smile, don't argue, let the
voter vote provisionally, and give them an &quot;I voted&quot; sticker.
Let the Board of Elections sort things out before canvas day. But under
this bill, the voter who votes a provisional ballot because of a lack of
an ID has to make a second trip, this time to the Board of Elections
office for the vote to count. Many people don't have the transportation
to get there and probably will be disenfranchised.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The Chair thanks you, sir.</p>

Speaker number 96, Frank Iler, you have the floor, sir, for time not to
exceed 3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I am Frank Iler, I'm from Raleigh. Many opponents of voter
integrity tend to justify their views by denying the existence of voter
fraud in North Carolina. I disagree with that. Consider this recent case
investigated by the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina. It
featured a voter named Jose Luis Gomez. Now, this person of interest
proved that he was a non US citizen to the North Carolina court system
after he voted in an election. According to their own documents, the
Wade country clerk of courts received evidence from Jose Gomez that
disqualified the voter from jury duty on the basis of not being a
citizen. Now, the actual date of the disqualification was December 30th
in '09. But a vote was recorded in this person's name on November 2nd,
'04. I repeat, the vote occurred before the jury disqualification so
it's obviously voter fraud. The evidence was turned over to the board of
elections but they didn't seem to care. Not only did they deny all of
the changes by using hearsay evidence, but the North Carolina
Administrative Office of the Courts quickly moved to deny us access to
similar jury data from other counties. State Board of Elections appeared
to be more interested in derailing the investigation than they were
about the fact that the non citizen was voting in our election. It's
just one example of voter fraud in North Carolina, but there are several
more. How many will it take for you to see the point, that election
fraud is a serious problem in North Carolina? Some groups oppose any
credible election reform by attacking the messenger. Believe the facts
should stand for themselves. Our findings are just the tip of an iceberg
because voter fraud is a very real problem. The people of North Carolina
are sick of election fraud. We've got one chance to get it right, so
keep that in mind. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair thanks you sir. Speaker number 97, Alex Brown. Glad you're
here sir. You have the floor for time not to exceed 3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Hello everybody, my name is Alex Brown and I come here today
from Wade County. Many opponents of voter integrity tend to justify
their views by denying the existence of voter fraud in North Carolina.
We respectfully disagree. Consider this recent case investigated for us
by the Buncombe county board of elections. It featured the voter named
William Tyler Hughes. This person of interest appears to have voted
illegally by exploiting provisions of the law called one stop voting, or
same day registration. According to their own documents, Buncombe County
Board of Elections, William Hughes registered to vote on 10, 31, 2012 at
an early voting location. During the board's routine follow up (??) for
this voter, they were unable to make any further contact. This leads us
to believe that a crime has occurred. One voter was disenfranchised
because another voter stole a vote. As of February of this year, a voter
was coded &quot;confirmation pending&quot;. If only one vote could
distort a fraud, many in this room would just shrug their shoulders but
this vote appears in patterns of fraudulent voting because there were 63
other voters in Buncombe County who got away with this same type of
voter fraud and every single vote counted. What was the impact? Their
county commission race was decided by 18 votes, 18. Every vote counts.
Thank you.

-welfare check or not to vote. The facts exist today that you've heard
from many others. I've read where over 107 absentee ballots were
returned at a Board of Elections as non-deliverable. Their votes
counted. These votes are all highly suspect. Some counties have more
registered votes than they have registered voters, and that brings a lot
of votes into question. There are many loopholes that influence our
elections and take rights away from law-abiding citizens. Your right to
have a fair election in representative government is very far from where
we exist today. You are in a place in history to give the people what
they want, and that's integrity. Stop the oppresion of honest voters'
rights. The people of North Carolina are fed up with the election fraud
that's been happening. We must remove the fraud. Tightening loopholes in
our election laws and passing real photo ID in North Carolina is one way
to do it, and I think you for your time today.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, everyone that is still listening
to all this long information about voter fraud, and I guess what I'm
picking up is possibly that we're not proving things that are really
happening out there. As a poll observer this last year, I also am a
transplant from another state, of Michigan, and I am proudly now happy
to be voter here in North Carolina. I was quite surprised that my voter
ID that I was so proud to have with a North Carolina address on it, was
not even required when I walked up to the-
