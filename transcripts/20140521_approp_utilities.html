is gonna be I'm gonna let Ms. Finnell[??] just go through the bill,
we're gonna let some folks from AT&amp;T answer any questions 'cause
they're the experts on it. I can and will answer some questions on this
side, too. So with that I will let Ms. Finnell start with the
explanation
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is not a PCS, is it Ms. Finnell? Just a straight bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. This is House Bill 1052 and this was a recommendation of
the LRC committee on utility regulatory fees and what this bill does is
it actually breaks out from the utility regulatory fee certain revenues
from telephone companies that are open to competition. If a telephone
company is open to competition it can elect an alternative form of
regulation, which are regularly called subsection M and subsection H.
For those revenues from those lightly less regulated services, they will
be subject to a lower regulatory fee. The non-retail revenues from
telephone companies and all other public utility revenues, your electric
companies, your gas companies, your water companies, they're still gonna
be subject to the same utility reg. fee. So we're basically breaking out
part of the reg. fee and allowing it to have a lower rate. So if you
look at sections 2 of the bill, 2a and 2b, it sets the jurisdictional
rate for fiscal years '15 and fiscal year '16. For subsection H it's set
at .6 for '15 and .4 for 2016. Section 3a and b also does the same for
subsection M revenues. It sets the rate at .5 for 2015 and .2 for 2016.
Section 4 does not set the other utility reg. fee. This is usually set
in the budget so this would be the reg. fee on all other revenues and it
does say that the intent of the General Assembly is to set that rate at
a rate that is enough to allow the utilities commission and the public
staff to continue to operate. The utility reg fee is imposed on
utilities to defray the cost of both the Utilities Commission and the
Public Staff and it's only used for those purposes and I'd be happy to
answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Finnell. This is basically a bill that, if you use a
service you pay for the service, if you don't use the service you don't
pay for the service. That's what it comes down to. Any questions from
the committee? You guys are easy today. Rodney, you have any questions?
Just kidding. Wait for a motion. Recognize Representative Moore for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move that we give a favorable report to House Bill 1052.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Favorable to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Favor with referral to finance.
ï»¿[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you representative Moore. All in favor? All opposed?
Thank you guys for being here today, it's the only business on the
calendar, we are adjourned.</p>
