[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Father, we pray for courage as we begin this day, for we understand
there is work to be done, burdens to be carried, feelings to be shared
and joys to be celebrated. Grant me the courage to be silent that we may
hear Thy voice; to persevere, that I may share Thy victory; and to
remember, lest we forget the way by which Thou have led us. And when
this day is done, O Lord, may I have the courage to see Thy guiding hand
in the friendships that have been made, in the hurts that have been
healed, and in the strength that has been given. In your son’s name we
pray, Amen.
