On February 19, and it came to the floor yesterday, so by my count, that
was almost three weeks since the bill was filed that it got to the
floor. This bill came out of reg reform with a unanimous vote for
favorable. And we had almost right at 75% of members of this body voting
from ??? yesterday. Today I’d like to ask for your vote again, see if we
can beat that 75% number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: If the lady will yield for just a moment,
Representative McGrady, does ??? intend to send forth an amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I do Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Does the lady wish to yield until the amendment is
considered?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative McGrady is recognized to send forth an
amendment.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative McGrady moves to amend the bill on
page 2, lines 32 and 33 by deleting the phrase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The gentlemen is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, this amendment
goes back to the discussion we had yesterday regarding three years or
six years. And as the author of the bill conceded, roughly half the
states are clearly on a three year cycle.  Some number of the other
states are somewhere, use typically three, but not always three, and
there’s no state, actually, that mandates a six year cycle.  The closest
to the six year cycle that is currently in law among the fifty states is
a recently enacted law in the state of Michigan, which provides
flexibility, allowing the similar councils we’ve got here to go to six
years, but also allowing it to move that up as close to three years. So
my amendment simply takes the language in the Michigan in law and makes
it North Carolina law. And my intent here frankly is just to not have
North Carolina as an outlier. If we move to a mandated six year cycle,
we will be the only state in that position, and I really think that’s a
mistake. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  You know we talked about
this yesterday. Three years, six years makes a huge difference in the
cost of a house. Every time we look at re-upping the code it costs more
money to do that. We all have folks in our district. Again, we are
outliers within the united states. We are the fifth highest
unemployment. We have folks out of work we have folks struggling to
build houses. Every three years we look at the code, the cost gets more.
Every time we look at this code, the cost gets higher for a house.
Again, I asked the question yesterday. Do you guys want affordable
housing in North Carolina, or do you want to just keep increasing the
price? We talked a little yesterday about why folks would want to go to
a three year, and I think Representative Harrison talked about the
National Electrical Manufacturers, the National Chemistry Council,
Greenbuilders.  Well folks, these folks have products they want to bring
to market. This code is not to get products to bail have to build with,
and have to have our builders use products from the National Electrical
Manufacturer to the National Chemical Society. It’s not for that, it’s
for safety.  I’ll give you guys a good example. I brought some props
today. This is a hurricane clip. This is an engineered hurricane clip,
Representative Catlin, Representative Arp, they all understand. This is
engineered for a reason. It’s to keep your roof on your house when you
have a hurricane coming through. Pretty straight forward. Another piece,
a rafter tie, same thing. These are what you have to have to have a safe
house. Now, the reason you go to a three year code is because of this,
or things that represent this. This is a choice, this is not a have to
have. If you go to three years cycles, the energy efficiency code will
continue to increase, it will continue to cost the House to build houses
more, and it will continue to drive people out of the housing market. So
I ask you to vote no on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Carney, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this
amendment. I’d like to be able to vote for this bill. As a former county
commissioner, I see the need for the uniformity. I agree that if we
could just accept this amendment, and it doesn’t really take it away
from the six year, it just gives us the flexibility to go between the
three year and the six year. So I think it’s a good amendment that I’m
not sure that it does all that harm to the bill itself, but it gives
those of use that would like to vote for this bill a little leeway to
make it easier. So I would encourage you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Brody, please state your purpose.

<p id="15:00">
...can see, well, I explained last night my feelings on it.  I want to
just address this amendment briefly.  What the amendment that we're
doing; I'm going to have to ask the question, who decides who's going to
initiate this review?  If it's going to be the code council, if it's
going to be collaboration between the realtors and the villages'
association, and the remodeler's association?  It's just too confusing
to decide and his amendment didn't even decide that.  I would--I support
the Representative Hager's view.  Six years, it goes by pretty fast and
it also has the ability to be amended as needed; and I do reject the
amendment.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I-I simply wanted to respond to the question that was asked--who
decides.  The building code council would decide whether it feels like
it needs to move forward on an earlier track; presumably based on the
standards that are coming down from the international building code
council or whatever it is called.  I would also note the the bill, even
now, and this is a good piece of the bill, allows the council to move
forward if, you know, some sudden safety issue arrives.  The bill's
authors and supporters have taken care of that issue.  So, I--I don't
really think that's an issue.  And finally, I'd just say--you know--if
this is really an effort to get at an [sic] energy efficiency standards,
then let's have that debate at some point.  But, this isn't the way to
do it.  This is much broader than some set of energy efficiency
standards that is here; and I think we've got some really good people
that can manage the code just fine.  And, I urge you to support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reprentative Arp, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I wanted to do is clarify a little bit again, as it relates to the
code, and the way--the way the process works.  The way the current bill
is structured now is that the building code council may periodically
revise the building code, but the wholesale change of the building code
would not occur prior to six years, in terms of the cycle. Because we
use the national standard, the international code council, as the basis,
we really only have two choices. It's either three or six, in terms of
what's available to them to be able to do this.  This amendment would in
fact just negate the possibility to move to a six year cycle, or a four
year or a five year; or anything like that.  You have to either do it at
three or six. And the whole point of this is to provide some stability.
Again, the code has the--the language of the bill as it's written now,
provides flexibilities for the building code council to go back and make
necessary amendments as--as they deem fit, but not wholesale change the
code but once every six years.  And that's really what we're talking
about here.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if the amendment sponsor will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Representative McGrady, now am I to understand
that you understand that if things come up that affect the structural
integrity of a home, or the safety of a home; which the code is designed
to do, those things can be put into the code before the six year cycle?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I conceded that, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And--and the fact that the six year cycle only has to do with--as
Representative Arp said--with the overall look at the code. [inaudible]
could still get in the code as the--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He [??] accurately stated my--what the effect of my amendment would
be--with one slight exception.  I believe my amendment would allow them
to take it up at anywhere from year three to year six.  But, with that
exception, I believe he stated it accurately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So--so we all understand that things can be put in the code as needed.
Without the six year cycle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
--Changes that are of a safety or nature that are--you know--one
item--certainly can be picked up and in theory a large number of issues
could be picked up if the building code council found the need to do
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yield to a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I assume on the safety issue--if things can be taken up in the

your structural issues. Maybe energy efficiency wouldn't be one of those
safety or structural issues to be taken up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Frankly, Representative Hager, I hadn't really thought about it, but I
presume that could be taken up, too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by

in favor vote aye, all in favor vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
All members wishing to record, please do so at this time. Representative
Dodson. Does the gentleman wish to record? Clerk will allow the machine
to record the vote. 41 having voted in the affirmative, 77 in the
negative, the amendment fails. We are back on the bill. Representative
Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, yesterday, I reported that I had talked
to my building inspector, I also talked to Representative Arp, and again
today I talked to the building inspector, so it seems to me the
information that I'm getting in inconsistent. The building inspector in
orange county has sent me a letter from the Home Builders Association
and I think the difference of opinion lies between the Home Builders
Association and the inspectors on the ground. So the Home Builders
Association is still telling the building inspectors that they may not
do open-floor framing inspections, that those are erroneous. So one
example that was given to me was the inability to inspect the lintels
over the windows, so when you build a brick house, you have windows, you
have to have a steel lentil to bear the weight of the bricks above it,
that if those are not inspected when they're put in, you may have to
tear down- I know you're shaking your head 'No.' I see that. I'm just
telling you what the Home Builders Association are saying to our
inspectors. I think this is a misunderstanding. We need some
clarification. I know this bill is going to pass today. I'll be working
on the senate side to try to get some clarification so that we don't end
up creating misunderstandings between our county-level... We all want to
do the right thing, there's no reason for us to create problems back
home, so I'm going to vote 'no' again on the bill today and I'll be
working on the Senate to try to get this clarified.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dobson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized. The chair understands the gentleman may
wish to change his vote on this amendment from an aye to a no, is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It will be recorded.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Hager, I remember vaguely, so
much has gone through my head since that period of time, that a couple
of years ago or so, there was a real slew of e-mails that I got, from, I
believe it was Home Builders, or people in the construction industry
about an issue of codes not being published. Does this have anything to
do with what you're working on with this building code that we're
currently looking at?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the questions, Representative. I think that it is loosely
related to the fact of allowing what happened with energy codes for this
past year, as you may or may not remember, is we were asking our home
builders to go out there and enact code that they had no documentation
on what they were supposed to do and our inspectors had no training on
what they were supposed to inspect. It's loosely associated with that to
make sure that we can catch up with the code revisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I had hoped to send forward a one-word amendment, but I see
that staff has not arrived at that one-word amendment, and I wonder if
there is anyway in which, and if Representative Hager supports the
amendment, is there any way, Madam Clerk, we can do a one-word
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, does the gentleman wish to temporarily displace
the bill so the amendment can be processed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill will be temporarily displaced.

goals of the ?? system was to ?? future bad behaviors specifically or
generally and another on this to incapacitate people who we are fear of
and no other ways to handle the penalties that are being enhanced in
this bill served those purposes we know the purpose of the terms because

that are in place are not deterring, they are not sufficient.  We have
the data to show that.  So in these cases I think this makes good policy
sense, and the people who are doing this kind of harm to these children
need to be incapacitated for as long as the system can do it in many of
these cases.  The children, I think this was said at the press
conference, some of these, many of these children, will suffer the harm
that was inflicted on through for a lifetime.  The abusers to do that to
them should also be seriously incapacitated for the rest of their lives,
if possible.  I support this bill, and I think that it will help save
the lives of some children, and certainly improve the possibilities that
a number of children will not be harmed in the future by recidivists who
would otherwise be out there doing this.  So I support the bill.

I wanted to further explain that, in addition, when we were researching
this bill, one of the questions I asked was what's the recidivism rate
on child abusers?  What is that?  We don't know.  We don't know
specifically, because of the way we code these convictions in the
system.  So included in this bill is that change, so that we will begin
to track the child abusers, and understand more of the serial activity,
and be able to identify more clearly those that perpetrate this terrible
crime.  I ask for support.

Whereas March 12 marks the 101st anniversary of girl scouts of the USA,
founded by Juliette Gordon Lowe court in 1912, in Savannah, Georgia, and
whereas without its distinguished history, girl scouting has inspired
millions of girls and women with the highest ideals of courage,
confidence and character, and whereas through the girl scout leadership
experience, girls develop the skills and lessons that will serve them a
lifetime, so that they may contribute to their communities, and whereas

opportunities available to them today in math, science, sports,
technology and other fields that can expand their horizons, and whereas

...members in all 100 North Carolina counties. Now, therefore, be it
resolved by the House of Representatives, Section 1, the House of
Representatives honors the memory of Juliette Gordan Low, for her role
in founding the Girl Scouts of the USA and expresses appreciation to the
members of the Girl Scouts for their commitment to building girls of
courage, confidence and character, who make the world a better place.
Section 2, the principal clerk shall transmit a certified copy of this
resolution to the Girl Scouts of the USA, national headquarters. Section
3, this resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
House, and to the Girl Scouts in the gallery and your leaders who are
with us today. I rise to remind my colleagues of a resolution that we
passed in this House on February the 4th honoring the Boy Scouts of
America on their 100th year anniversary. Well today, we are honoring the
101 anniversary of the Girl Scouts of America. As you've heard in the
resolution, Juliette Low founded this organization in 1912 and you've
heard that there are 3 million plus young women today that are in this
organization and over hundreds of thousands of leaders that have
committed their time to help these girls invest in and instill in them
values such as their character building, their honesty and their
fairness, and their courage, that they earn and they learn those through
the badges that they earn. Of the 50 million that you heard about women,
that have been scout leaders or scout members, I am one of those 50
million. I was not only a Brownie, I was a Girl Scout and I was a Girl
Scout leader. My three daughters went through scouting and of my six
granddaughters, we have two of the little girls that are starting to
blossom into scouting. And then two of the teenagers went into scouting,
also. So it does make an impact on what these young women learn at a
young age and the impact that the leaders make on their lives. And I say
thank you to all of you and I commend this resolution to you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, the Chair understands there may
be a friendly amendment sent forth by Representative Lewis, if you would
like to consult with him after and we will recognize Representative
Farmer-Butterfield to debate the resolution. The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Juliette
Gordon Low, the founder of the Girl Scouts, was developing the movement
with girls of all ages coming together. She wanted to give them the
opportunity to develop self reliance and encouragement to prepare not
only for traditional roles, but for future roles as professional women.
We're talking lawyers, doctors, state legislators, congresswomen and the
like. The Girl Scouts is the largest educational organization in the
world for women. Juliette Low has earned and garnered many accolades
during her illustrious career. They include having a stamp, a postage
stamp published in her honor. And this was signed through a bill by
President Harry Truman. Having the City of Savannah name a school for
her. And indeed, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame
in New York. In 1983, President Reagan signed a bill naming a Federal
building in Savannah in her honor. And, indeed, President Barack Obama
awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom after her death in April
of 2012. This is the highest civilian award in the United States. My
daughters, as Representative Carney mentioned, were also Girl Scouts and
Brownies, and I was a Brownie and Girl Scout. And indeed it molded and
shaped my life and in fact, I can remember starting a troop in Wilson to

church many years ago so that more girls could have an opportunity to
participate in The Girl Scouts. To House Members I ask you to please
join me in honoring Juliette Gordon Low for her efforts in establishing
an organization for the betterment of all girls as well as show
appreciation for The Girl Scouts, current and former, who have committed
themselves to building a better place for the world. I commend the
resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep Lewis please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Obviously unlike the prior-to speakers I was not
member of the Girl Scouts. I'm certain I would have benefited had I had
that experience. Fortunately for me though, my little girl is. And
there's a lot stuff that we talk about every day, that, some of it
brings us together, some of it kinda drives us apart. But I wanna talk
to you about a real success story. And I, just get my notes, I don't
wanna make a mistake here. Troop 1783 which is based in Dunn, is a Girl
Scout Troop. And this Troop in one years time, because of simply going
out, and advocating how important Girl Scouts can be in the lives of
young girls. And because of the dedicated women volunteers who lead this
group has grown in one year from seven members to fifty. And the things
that they learn, and the things that they are taught, will indeed as the
resolu-, as the resolution says, be with them forever. And I'm very,
very proud that my daughter and girls all across the state have a chance
to be involved in such a wonderful organization. And with that Mr.
Speaker if it's ready may I be recognized to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen is recognized to send forth an
amendment, The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis
moves to amend the bill on page one line 25 by, to read The Girl Scouts
of the USA National Headquarters and The Girl Scouts of North Carolina
Headquarters. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I wanted to add
and I apologize that I didn't talk to Representative Carney prior to
this. But we have a great Girl Scout organization here in this state, in
fact they just have appointed a brand new CEO Lisa Jones. And I wanted
for this great group to also be able to receive, from our Clerk, a
certified copy of this. So, I would appreciate your support on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker and I welcome this amendment from Representative Lewis. And
for those of you out there, you young ladies listening, this is how the
process works. Amendments are good and they should be accepted and
worked with. It's working with each other and I welcome it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Representative Lewis, The Chair, is relieved to
hear you were not a member of The Girl Scouts, but I'm glad to hear that
your daughter is, as was mine. Further discussion, further debate on the
amendment? If not the question before The House is the adoption of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Lewis to House Resolution ?75,
all in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The Clerk is op-, The Clerk
will open the vote. All Members wishing to record please do so at this
time. Representative Blackwell. The Clerk will let the machine record

the amendment passes, we are back now on the bill. Representative Duane
Hall please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My comments will be very brief because I
think this resolution has a pretty good chance. I'd just like to express
my personal appreciation for being here with me everyday, I'm a freshman
legislator and we've had a few late nights already and I expect quite a,
few more in the future. But every single night here on the floor as well
as all the rest in the future.</p>

Representative McManus, Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I may be asking for a point of personal privilege. I'm not real
clear on this, but I too was a Brownie Scout, a Girl Scout, and a Girl
Scout leader. And both of my daughters were Girl Scouts. I would love to
see how many people, how many of the ladies, here in the chamber were
Scouts. Would it be possible for them to stand and be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All the members will please stand who were members of the Girl Scouts.
And if the Chair may have a point of personal privilege. My daughter was
a Girl Scout. She's now twenty four years old. And I think this time of
year, to Representative Hall's point, this is I think, cookie time. And
the Chair would suggest that if you get approached by a Girl Scout, you
simply respond with, how many? And bring them here. Further discussion,
further debate on the resolution. If not, the question before the House
is the adoption of House Resolution 275 as ammended. All in favor will
vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The clerk
will let the machine record the vote. 118 having voted affirmative, and
none in the negative. House Resolution 275 has been, has ammended, has
been adopted. It will be ordered engrossed, and ordered printed.
Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, upon motion of the Chair and all the
members, the Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to
Girl Scout members, volunteers, and staff of North Carolina's Scout
Counsel, Colonial Coast, Hornet's Nest Counsel, North Carolina Coastal
Pines and Peaks to the Piedmont here on Girl Scout birthday and for, in

Ladies and Gentlemen, we are now back to House Bill 120. Representative,
is the ammendment? Representative Luebke is recognized to enforce the
ammendment, the Clerk will read.

Representative Luebke moves to end the bill on page one, line 32. And on
page two, line 22 by deleting timely, and substituting reasonable.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of Staff told me that reasonable would
actually be more precise than timely, would handle the process better.
And I appreciate that Representative Hager supports the ammendment. And
so I think we could have 120 to zero. Thank you.

[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, this is one in the series of
bills to move our education toward a digital environment. This bill has
to do with training the teachers, moving the teaching professional
development bill. It passed our house, passed unanimously through the
education committee, passed the house 114 votes, went to the Senate,
they made one slight modfication, which I am perfectly fine with, and
when I say slight, I meant pretty slight, and in fact gave a little more
flexibility to the teachers and the colleges of education so that we're
not holding them to a particularly tightly woven rule. I am really fine
with it and I can't imagine that anybody here would not be. I move for
concurrence and ask your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last year I had 15 minutes spare, and I was walking by the place where
they were doing the skin cancer screening, and I figured well, there are
plenty of shades so that no one sees you because granted, I've never
been accused of being model material. But I took 10 minutes to have a
full body scan and the doctor looked at a place on my arm and said that
is a basal cell carcinoma, I guarantee you. And if you can't make an
appointment next week, you come see me the week after and we'll take
care of it. So I made an appointment and had a more detailed examination
and two places were removed, one it was in fact a mole, but there was a
suspicion that it might have been melanoma, which is the bad one. The
other was basal cell carcinoma, and they scrape it off with something
kinda like a melon baller and it hurts like hell, but then you go for a
year and you know that you're not gonna die. Now, I argue with a lot of
you people, but quite frankly, I don't want you to have a couple of days
wondering as I did, if the doctor's gonna tell you that thing's not
really a mole. It's a death sentence. It's not something I would wish on
any of you. Though if you don't have a skin cancer screening from time
to time, take advantage tomorrow, and then we can come back tomorrow and
debate bills in the marketplace of ideas together. Free of at least one
worry of a bad outcome. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
