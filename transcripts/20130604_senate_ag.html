<p id="00:00">
&lt;h3&gt;Good morning everybody we're going to start ??. Take your
seat. Like to welcome our pages this morning, we have Eva Barlow from
Wilmington, thank you Eva. We have Allison Clark from Raleigh, we have
Madison Bell from Lewisburg, we have Grayson Russell, is that correct?
We have Amelia Maggan is that correct? Close? OK. We have Mary Catherine
Starnge from Hickory. We have Grace, you're going to have to help me
with this one Grace, pardon me? Rockpogul, close enough ok? Thank you
Grace. She's from Raleigh, glad to have you with us. Lily Canny from
Reidsville, and we have Haley Web from Summerville. Thank you all for
being with us, hope you enjoy your week. Our Senator of Arms Charles
Hopper. Head Counselor, and Justin Owens. Thank you all. Our first bill
this morning is House Bill 821-Triad Farmer's Market renamed Senator Bob
Shawl. Who do we have to run that one from the house. Oh, Representative
Blust, glad to have you with us, good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you members of the Senate. This is a,
is a noncontroversial bill in that I believe it passed the House
unanimously. It simply renames the Piedmont Triad Farmer's Market that's
near the Forsythe-Milford line right on the highway, many of you might
have passed that in travels. Renames it for former senator, Robert Shaw,
Bob Shaw to many people. Many in this senate knew him, he was a senator
for 18 years, served in the Army Air Corps, was a county commissioner
chairman for a while. And with this we are not trying to get credit for
Bob Shaw for the farmer's market, it's just to name it for him to honor
a distinguished career in public service. I do have permission from
Senator Tillman to say he's a strong supporter of it. He was good
personal friends with Senator Shaw and Senator Bingham favors the bill
too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like for us to strongly support this. This is from my area. I
knew Bob for a long time. I was at his fish houses, as I guess a young
candidate out and Bob and Linda I've known them for years and I think
this would be a great honor for Bob and I would appreciate it if we
could support this bill and I move for a favorable response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, I'll hold that for one moment. Any questions from the committee? If
not, we have a motion for a favorable response to House Bill 821. No
discussion all in favor let it known by saying &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed like so. Bill is passed. Thank you sir. House Bill 369,
increase penalty seed law violations. Who we got, Representative
Waddell. Come in, welcome. Welcome to the better side of the chambers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. House Bill 369
simply changes increases the maximum penalty that you can have on the
seed law violation from $500 to $10,000.  It hasn't been changed since
the 1930s is my understanding. So, I would ask you, I would stand here
and be able to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But we have a move for a favorable report from Senator Raven, I hold
that one second, any comments or questions from the Committee if not all
those in favor of House Bill 369, let it be known by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed like so. Bill is passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. OK House Bill 505 extend division of solar and water
conservation. For animal waste inspections. Representative Waddell come
back to see us again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Much like being here Mr. Chairman. Appreciate that. House Bill 505 is an
attempt to codify a program that's already in place. It's basically the
program was started in 1997 as a pilot program. It just -
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

…say the feasibility of having the Division of Soil and Water
Conservation do the annual inspections of all concentrated animal
feeding operations in the area. It was originally assigned to two
counties, Pender and Columbus.
It was expanded to include Jones and Brunswick County. The Department of
Soil and Water Conservation, has always provided the technical expertise
as to best management practices, which include conservation measures and
nutrient management along with lagoon design.
They’re also responsible for the design of the Nutrient Management Plans
or Animal Waste Plans. The thinking was and still should be that the
Division of Soil and Water Conservation did the Operations Review and in
preparation for the annual inspection…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. We have a…Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I move for a favorable report of the program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a favorable report, but I’ve been told we have an amendment that
needs to be run. I’ll let Senator…Jeff Hudson, I just promoted you. I
did a demotion. I’m sorry. I did a demotion. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Co-Chair. This is just a technical amendment. I’ve got
copies to pass out but I think I can explain it so that you all can tell
what it does. In the second section of the bill you’ll see on line 28
there’s a reference to, “As amended by Section Two of this act,” that
should actually be, “Section One.” Section One of the bill is amending
the statute that’s being referenced there. So all the technical
amendment does is change Section Two to Section One.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I’m OK with the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. I have motion to approve the amendment. Any discussion on the
amendment? If not, all those in favor let it be known by saying, “Aye.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed lights on. The amendment is passed. Now, Senator Walters has
made a motion for a favorable report. Any discussion? All those in favor
of the House Bill 505 with the amendment attached let it be known by
saying, “Aye.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, lights on. The bill is passed as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. OK. House Bill 480, “Environmental Permitting Review.”
Representative Millis, welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. Before you here is House
Bill 480. To be very brief with this, in regard to regulation in this
state, there are pretty much three pillars, you have statutes, you have
rules, and you have policy.
This bill aims to take out the evolving nature of regulatory policy when
it comes to state stormwater. Not local stormwater, other aspects, but
state stormwater by establishing a minimum design criteria.
This has already been done in the early ‘90s administratively by DNR for
sanitary sewer. We’re just encouraging them with this legislation to do
it for stormwater as well. With that NDC will be able to actually do
what’s called a fast-track process which will allow design professionals
to design and certify these aspects without going through extensive
technical review.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Senator Cook?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, we have a motion for a favorable report. Any discussion? Senator
Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure if…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, if you will pull your mic to you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’m not sure what this does. Some years ago
we established a fast-track permitting process for people who would be
willing to pay more. Is that the same thing we’re talking about or is
this something entirely different?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Chris.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, in regard to the language of the bill, the fast-track in terms
of the name of it, it mimics what has been done for sanitary sewer in
the past.
What it actually does from the aspects of the language of the bill is
that it’s not about the aspect of paying more in as much as it is about
the ability to say and to certify that your design has been done per the
minimum design criteria and forego a technical review whenever you have
a professional who has taken liability as well as a certified has been
done for the NDC.
So the terms may coalesce with what’s been done in the past, but it’s
just not about price, it’s actually about the process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? If not, all those in favor of the motion, let it be
known by saying, “Aye.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, lights on. The motion passed. House Bill 480 is passed.
Thank you, Senator Cook. Thank you, sir. OK. House Bill 707, “Ensure
Safe…”</p>

All those in favor let me know by saying aye.

Aye (group)
[Speaker Change]
All opposed like ??. Motion is passed. Thank you Representative Millis.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman.
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir Mr. ??
[Speaker Change]
I'll be happy to run that on the floor if you're asking for that ??.
[Speaker Change]
OK very good, thank you. That's a good point, something I forgot to do
on these other bills.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman. I'll be happy to run Representative Riddell's wage bill on
the floor too if you have nothing to ??.
[Speaker Change]
Alright, you got that Mr. OK. Bear with us just one moment. OK. OK.
We've got house bill 369. Senator Barefoot would you be willing to run
that one. Kay house bill's 369 will be Senator Barefoot. Senator Wade I
assume you'll be glad to do house bill 821. Well you ought to do ??. OK
house bill 789 underground storage tanks eligible for brown fields.
Representative Gatlin's gonna present this one. Welcome to the Senate
act committee.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Committee members North Carolina has a very good
brown field agreement program that allows for the redevelopment of
property vacant or derelict that has remnant contamination. It's an
intensive process that ensures the public health and safety, but the
biggest benefit is it allows utilization of existing infrastructure like
roads, and water, and sewer, and schools, and police, and fire
protection. Presently that includes these brown field agreement options
include petroleum contamination, but it illuminates petroleum
contamination that comes from underground storage tanks. What this bill
will do would be to make the UST or underground storage tank sites also
eligible for the North Carolina brown field program. The responsible
party will still be liable for any additional remediation. The
prospective developer will still be subject to land use restrictions as
determined through the brown field agreement process and lending
organizations will be at their contamination. Liability will be removed
which makes it possible to redevelop these properties. It's very good
for economic growth using existing infrastructure and it has the full
support of ??. So I would appreciate your support.
[Speaker Change]
OK. Any questions from Senator cook?
[Speaker Change]
We move for a favorable report.
[Speaker Change]
OK I’ll hold that just a moment. Any comments or questions from the
committee? Any from the audience? We have a motion by Senator Cook for a

saying aye.
[Speaker Change]
Aye (group)
[Speaker Change]
All opposed light sign. The bill has passed. Who will be running this
one on the floor?
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman I have talked to Senator McLaurin. I ?? can follow-up with.
[Speaker Change]
OK well we'll tentatively put him down. Thank you Representative Gatlin.
OK house bill 581 trophy wildlife sale permit. Representative Elmore.
[Speaker Change]
Good morning and welcome. What this bill does it allows for rules to be
created for the resale of taxidermy. Currently we do not have any rules
in place for this and this issue was brought to me by one of my
constituents and oddly enough Representative West had the same issue
brought to him from his district. In my opinion this bill will help
auction houses, pawn shops, antique builders, etc., especially third
parties. Any third party sales of pieces of taxidermy.
[Speaker Change]
OK.
[Speaker Change]
I appreciate your support.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Kinnaird.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Many years ago, like 30 years ago my son was out in
his truck and some big bird flew into the hood and it died. So I put it
in my ?? It was a very pretty bird and we didn't know what to do with
it. So we put it in my freezer. Years later I went to a taxidermists and
said could I get this stuffed and give it to my son for his birthday.
They told me I couldn't do that because you cannot do that with any bird
that's declared, I don't know what, any endangered or whatever. So after
the last hurricane my son was staying in my house and he threw it out
unfortunately. But I wanna know under this bill could I have had that
bird stuffed and given it to my son for his birthday.
[Speaker Change]
OK.
[Speaker Change]
Go right ahead on this one.

Specifically I'm not sure but I will tell you the</p>

How this ties in with the rule making. We wanted to do a simple bill
just to allow this, but with all of the federal regulations dealing with
certain animals, the Wildlife Commission felt like they needed to
address that in the rule making, so someone's not selling endangered
species that sort of thing, and using this law to do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Anyone got a better story than that last one? Well I have two
waving their fingers I assume Senator Rabin has the motion for a
favorable report?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
