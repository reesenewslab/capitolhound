[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, it is an
honor for me to stand here before you this afternoon and talk about my
friend and mentor, Leo Mercer. Leo was one of those guy who didn’t carry
a big stick.  He walked softly.  He walked softly but he got things
done.  During my tenure as board member in Chadburn, he was very
instrumental in trying to get some things done from the little small
town I’m from such as a new town hall.  And he went about doing that in
the official way he had always done that. And that is to try to pull all
of the knowledge he had from years past to give that for a small town
like Chadburn, 2200 people.  It gives me great honor and pleasure too,
to know that his daughter is here today and stands before this body and
recognizes the fact that her daddy was really, really important to the
state of North Carolina. If you look on the resolution and you look at
some of the things that we’re speaking about Leo...  Representative
Bowles here is a member, a part owner, in a funeral home.  And I’m sure
you have made his acquaintance here many years and have had a
relationship with him over the years.  He had 33 years with the US
Postal Service.  He served as mayor – he’s the longest serving mayor of
Chadburn.  He served a total of 16 years. He served on the Columbus
County Board of Education for 6 years.  He served in the North Carolina
House for 4 years.  He served as a special assistant to the governor for
5 years.  All totaled up, I added a total of 35 years of service to the
state of North Carolina.  I would be proud to know that I…</p>

Have served the state the way that he has. I cannot think of a more
godly man either because he was a member of the church that I’m a member
of and was always extremely, extremely involved in the church: served as
deacon, served on ?? of various committees. But I say that only to point
out that he was essentially really all about service and that’s what all
of us are all about, service. I’m proud to have known him, I’m proud to
have had him as a mentor, and I’m certainly proud to have had him as a
friend. There’s probably not anyone other than my father that I looked
up to more than Leo. Having said all that I know that many of you in
here hope that your legacy will be of service to the state of North
Carolina and I think Leo’s speaks for itself and I commend the
resolution to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Whereas Memorial Day was first observed as Decoration
Day on May 30, 1868 as an occasion to decorate the graves of Civil War
soldiers and whereas after World War I, Decoration Day was expanded to
honor service members killed in all our nation’s wars and after World
War II Decoration Day became known as Memorial Day, and whereas in 1971
Congress established Memorial Day as a federal holiday to be observed on
the last Monday in May and whereas as we observe Memorial Day in 2014 it
is important to remember and reflect on the contributions and sacrifices
of the men and women of our armed forces who have made in upholding the
principles that are the foundation  of our democracy and liberty while
in service to our nation and whereas it is fitting to honor and commend
the North Carolinians as well as the men and women who served with
military units based in North Carolina who were killed in the line of
duty and thus paid the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the freedom that
we enjoy. Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives
section 1, the House of Representatives expresses its profound gratitude
and appreciation to all the men and women of the United States armed
forces for their selfless service. Section 2, the House of
Representatives wishes to honor the memory of all of the members..</p>

[Speaker Changes]
The gentlemens's recognize to debate the resolution.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the house. In June of nineteen
sixty three in an earlier version of a speech that came to be known as I
have a Dream. Martin Luther King said of the struggle for freedom even
if they try to kill you, you develop the inner conviction
that there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things
so eternally true that they are worth dying for. Today, we come
somberly, soberly, and solemnly to pay homage to those who in our
history gave their lives because they knew the eternal principles
that underlie our freedom are precious enough to be worth dying for. At
the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy
addressed the nation and concluded by saying the cost of freedom is high
but Americans have always paid the cost. The one path
that we will never choose is one of surrender or submission. We seek not
the victory of might but the vindication of right. Not peace at the
expense of freedom but both peace and freedom here in this hemisphere
and we hope around the world. Today, we come with
a sense of reverence and it's not too strong a word, a sense of awe to
celebrate those men and women who gave their lives to achieve that goal
of both peace and freedom for us. They willingly walked into tho valley
of the shadow of death because they knew that peace
and freedom was a goal that we needed to achieve. Our words of praise
may seem weak and feeble compared to their sacrificial deeds but we
should never forget how much of a debt we owe to them because we know
that it's the soldier, not the network news anchor
that gave us freedom of speech. It's the soldier not the newspaper
editor that gave us freedom of the press. It's the soldier, not the
pastor, priest, or rabbi that gave us freedom of religion. It's the
soldier not the judge who gave us the right to do process. It's the
soldier, not
the protester who gave us the right to peaceably assemble, and it's the
soldier who solutes the flag, who serves beneath the flag and his blood
soaked coffin is draped by the flag that has made it possible for the
protester to burn the flag. It is the soldier whether Army, Navy,
Air-force Marine or coast guard who has made it possible for us to
gather here today in this assembly that represents the highest
aspirations of freedom and man kind, a legislative body elected by the
people, to serve the people. It's the very essence of a constitutional
Republic, Words alone are not adequate for what we need to do here
today. Action is required, no one said this more eloquently than Lincoln
at Gettysburg. It is for us, the living rather to be dedicated here
to...</p>

<p id="25:00">
Unfinished work, which they who fought here, have thus far so nobly
advanced.  It is rather for us, to be here dedicated to the great task
remaining before us. That from these honored dead, we take increased
commitment to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of
devotion.  That we here highly resolve, that these dead shall not have
died in vain, but that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
freedom.  In a Republic, preserving freedom will always be an unfinished
work.  That was the cause for which they gave the last full measure of
devotion.  We can never honor them adequately unless we take increased
resolve to complete the unfinished work of preserving freedom.  For we
know, as Ronald Reagan said, Freedom, is always only one generation away
from extinction.  We didn’t pass it to our children in the blood stream.
 The only way they can inherit the freedom we have known is if we fight
for it, protect it, defend it, and then pass it on to them with the
well-taught lesson of how they in their life must do the same.  If you
and I do not do that, then you and I may well spend our sunset years
telling our children and our children’s children what it was like once
to live in an America where men were free.  So, to properly honor the
men and women on Memorial Day and in this resolution, we must resolve
that we will not be that generation that loses freedom in America.  We
must find something in ourselves to pass this great inheritance on to
the next generation, whole, so that they can do the same.  The Wounded
Warrior Project has identified seven characteristics that we find almost
uniformly in those who volunteer to go protect freedom.  I am sure there
are exceptions, but these characteristics are prevalent.  Duty, honor,
courage, commitment, integrity, country, and service.  People have seen
these characteristics exhibited in their soldiers and in our veterans
and rightly hold them in high regard.  I wonder if, one reason the
political class is no held in high regard, is because people look at
those involved and don’t see those characteristics a lot of times.  If
we really want to honor those who died in the defense of freedom, we
need to adopt those same characteristics as a code that we always
operate the people’s business according to.  I think if that were to
happen, you would see inspired leadership and the people, knowing that
it was real, would react in an inspired way, and we could have the new
birth of freedom that President Lincoln spoke about at Gettysburg.  We
do have so many advantages, there is reason to be optimistic.  We have
the example of our ??.  We have the great writings about the ideals and
principals that ?? liberty.  We have the historical record.  We have,
chiefly, the example of self-sacrifice of those we honor today.  We
shouldn’t have as big of a difficulty as we have, in turning this ship
estate around and getting it back to where we should go, to emulate
these soldiers, airman, marines, and seaman, and win back the confidence
of the public in their institutions and in rule of law.  If we will do
that, then we will truly honor our fallen heroes who, in the words of
Lincoln, have laid such a costly sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.

Resolutions, of course yesterday was Memorial Day. One of the other
great holidays which we celebrate the men and women who serve our
country in uniform is Veterans Day in Novemeber, Veterans day is for all
who have served, living or dead. Memorial
Day is for those who are no longer with us, who have given their lives
in service. There's many things that we disagree on in this body but
there are two things I know we agree on, our support for our veterans
and also that none of us want to be here in November.
So that's one of the reasons we did the resolution last week, today is
our memorial resolution. The gentleman from Gilford eloquently quoted
from probably the diffinative speach on what makes memorial day memorial
day. President Lincoln's address, the Gettysburg
address at the dedication of the cemetary on the Gettysburg battlefield.
About eighty years later a half a world away another eloquent speaker
delivered remarks at the dededication of the fifth Marine Division
Cemetary on Hijima on March nineteen forty five. This was
lieutenant Chaplin Rowland B. Gettleson and he and his remarks also
quoted the Gettysburg address beginning the world will little note nor
long remember what we say here, it can never forget what they did here.
Chaplin Gettleson continued. No, our four power speech
can add nothing to what these men and the other dead of our division who
were not here have already done. All that we can even hope to do is
follow their example, to show the same selfless courage and peace that
they did in war. To swear by the grace of God and the
stubborn strength and power of human will, their sons and ours shall
never suffer these pains again. These men have done their jobs well,
they have paid the ghastly price of freedom, if that freedom be once
again lost as it was after the last war the unforgivable blame
will be ours, not theirs. So it is we, the living who are here to be
dedicated and consecrated. Members, let us use this Memorial Day, and
every Memorial day and every Memorial Day to dedicate and consecrate
ourselves to these values. I would appreciate your support
for the resolution.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Larry Haul, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes]
Speak on the resolution.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentlemens recognize to debate the resolution.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and fellow members of the house, You've heard it
many times said the price of freedom is great, and there have been many
speeches around the world and all around the United States about the
great efforts of the American fighting man who
has been sent somewhere to do a job by elected officials in bodies such
as this and so those we trust make those policies but others who trust
in us carry them out at their own great parel. And maybe, of all the
speeches that have been made. The most succinct and clear
description of the sacrifices that have been made can be read in the
medal of honor citations that are in the congressional record in the
historical archives of the department of defense. And I want to take a
minute to read a couple of those because nothing I could say would
probably have more impact on you than what was said about these
individuals who gave their lives in the performance of their duty and in
the defense of their comrades, their platoon members, their fellow
Americans on the field of battle. I wanna read first Emilio
Delegarso's citation. Lance Corporal United States Marine Core Company E
Second Battalion, First Marines, first marine division, for conspicuous
gallantry at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty
while serving as a machine gunner with Company E.
returning with the Squad from a night Ambush, Guards adjoined his
platoon commander in and another Marine in searching for two enemy
soldiers who had been observed fleeing. Moments later they located one
of the enemy hiding among the reeves and brush. As the
three marines attempted to remove the resisting soldier, they observed
the soldier pull a pin on a hand grenade. Shouting a warning, Delegarsa
placed himself between the two other Marines and ensuing blast from the
grenade thereby saving the lives of his comrades
at the sacrifice of his own. By his prompt and decisive action, and his
great personal valor in the face of almost...</p>

death, Lance Corporel Dimidel is a pill and further enhance the finest
traditions of the Marine Core and the United State naval service. I
wanna read this second one regarding first luetenant Valderamo Lopez.
United States Marine Core Company A Firist betalion fifth
Marines for conspicuous gallantry and entrepedy at the risk of life
above and beyond the call of duty as Marine Platoon Commander of company
A in action against enemy aggressive forces, taken under fire by an
enemy Automatic weapon and hit in the right shoulder and
chest as he lifted his arm to throw a hand grenade, he fell backwards
and dropped the deadly missile. After a moment he turned and dragged his
body forward in an effort to retrieve the grenade and throw it. In
critical condition from pain and loss of blood and unable to grasp
the hand grenade firmly enough to throw it, he chose to sacrifice
himself rather than endanger the lives of his men and with a sweeping
motion of his wounded right arm, cradled the grenade under him and
absorbed the full blast an impact of the explosion. His exceptional
courage and fortitude and devotion to duty reflect the highest credit
upon first lieutenant Lopez, the United States Naval service and the
United States marine core He gallantly gave his life for his country.
Ladies and gentlemen. I think those medal of honor citations say it all.
For all of us who would wish to contribute, for all of us who would wish
to make that sacrifice, that we could make that difference every day and
know that young men like these who give their lives in times like these
depend on us to make the right decision, I recommend the
resolution to ya.

[Speaker Changes]
The gentlemen has recognized to debate the conference report.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes]
Members you may recall this bill passed the house last year, what it
does is reduces continuing education requirements for well contractors,
and whenever this bill passed the House the first time it reduced
continuing education, well let me start over. So currently well
contractors obtain six hours of continuing education a year but the
rules are rarely updated. There have been very few instances of
violations. So, I was contacted by one of my constituents in Gilford
County whos been a Well contractor for many years and says every
year you have to go in for six hours which basically takes you out of
work for an entire day and said we're not really learning anything new,
we're just sitting there, you learn nothing new so the original version
of the bill would reduce continuing education from six hours a
year to six hours every three years and that bill passed the House, went
to the Senate. The Senate reduced it to zero to no more continuing
education at all so when that bill came back I objected to it because I
felt like there should be some level of continuing education
and so we went to conference on it and I think what we've come up with
is an excellent. Thank you sir. One of my colleagues is looking out for
me. Excuse me, so the conference support now basically makes it so when
you get your license to be a Well Contractor for the
first three years you obtain education and then after that you have no
more continuing education unless you have a violation in which case you
go back for re...</p>

resolves the senate concurring.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Moore, please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] To debate the resolution.
[Speaker Changes] Gentleman has recognized to debate the resolution.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, the members of the house. Well,
you’ve heard before the resolution confirming the appointment of Dr.
Linda Combs as the state controller for North Carolina. She is an
impressive nominee, she has been appointed by 3 prior presidents and
previously served as the controller of the United States from 2005 to
2007. It was also confirmed by the United States Senate in there. We
think that you should know that she was the controller of the United
States, she reduced the audit completion time from 5 months to 45 days
for the entire federal government. First time that happened in history.
I’d only think George [xx] has been able to do that. Reduce in proper
payments by 9 billion, that was billion with a B dollars and dispose a
4.5 billion dollars of unneeded real property. She has an impressive
career, she has received accolades nationally and internationally. She
was born in Caldwell County up in Adgestone country and she now lives in
Winston-Salem and she came before the rules committee last week and
received a favor of recommendation from the rules committee. Members, I
would ask that we support the Governor’s nomination of Dr. Combs as
state controller. Thank You.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Debate the Resolution please.
[Speaker Changes] The Gentleman has recognized to debate the resolution.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I stand as well to encourage
the body to confirm Dr. Combs. I had the honor and privilege of serving
a number of months with her on the treasures and investment governance
commission and we developed a friendship. I think she is an
extraordinarily qualified pick and was a tremendous controller under the
United States president Bush. I found Dr. Combs to be not only an
extraordinary professional but extremely meticulous in her work and very
non-partisan in her approach and I found her to be probing on all
issues. I think the state will be extraordinarily well served by Dr.
Combs in this position and I really commend the resolution to you and
look forward to working with her.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Come up here really quick.  Menajah Smith.  Welcome.  We’re back to the
final item on the agenda.  House Joint Resolution 1112.  The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Joint Resolution 1112, a joint resolution to confirm the
appointment of Charles Nell Allen to the North Carolina Industrial
Commission.  The House resolves, the Senate concurring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House, you have before you the
resolution to confirm the appointment of Charles Nell Allen to the North
Carolina Industrial Commission.  Mr. Allen is from Mooresville, North
Carolina and was born down in Wilmington and has been an attorney since
1997.  Also, I had the privilege of attending UNC Chapel-Hill with
Charles so we go way back.  He is an attorney with a lot of experience
in the area of workers’ compensation which of course one of the main
functions of the Industrial Commission - to hear these kinds of cases.
The Industrial Commission ... you can always count on the Senate… is
responsible for administering the Workers’ Compensation Act and the
State Tort Claims Act.  The Industrial Commission is comprised of six
commissioners who are appointed by the governor to serve six-year terms.
 The commissioners are subject to the code of judicial conduct and
seated panels of three to review appeals of the deputy commissioner,
opinions and awards.  Mr. Allen is highly qualified for this position.
We had a Rules Committee meeting this last week where there were some
debate against him at the end, but there were no questions or anything.
I think he has been around and met a lot of you and has been here and
made himself available.  He also served, informally, on an informal
advisory committee for the Industrial Commission since 2013.  With that
being said, we would certainly recommend the body support Mr. Allen for
this appointment to the Industrial Commission.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Fellow House Members, I rise to oppose this
nomination.  I was in the Rules Committee as this came forward.  It
causes me great concern that we would have a nominee who has a
background and a professed opinion against the rights of workers to
receive fair pay and fair working conditions.  That might not be a
problem except for the fact that on this Industrial Commission, the
citizens of North Carolina rely on the integrity of it as decisions are
made that affect the lives and the families of many of the workers in
our state.  One of the missions of the Industrial Commission is to
resolve controversies by rendering impartial and will render decisions.
Because this nominee has already specifically and publicly stated his
opposition to workers’ rights and fair treatment, I think it calls into
question then the rulings and decisions that would be handed down under
his watch.  For that reason, again I would ask that you oppose this
nomination.  I think that the integrity of the Industrial Commission,
with all the recent changes that have been made, is at stake.</p>

<p id="60:00">
The people who rely on it are watching, and that we should ensure that
that integrity is there at least in the face of the changes that we
made. Again, I’ve met Mr. Allen. And if he were a nominee as a
pro-business advocate, maybe he would be appropriate to serve on this
board. But it requires impartiality which he has expressed he does not
have, and is opposed to workers’ rights. So I would ask that you oppose
the nomination. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak for the resolution and for the
nominee. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have known Mr.
Allen for 20 years. He was a year behind me in law school, and has been
practicing law since 1997. Worker’s comp has been a strong area of his
practice. Worker’s comp is what the industrial commission does. The
people, my friends on the other side of the aisle, seem to want to make
it something that it’s not. It has nothing to do with workers’ rights,
and paid sick leave, and all that kind of thing. It has to do with
injured workers. Mr. Allen’s clients have been almost exclusively
injured workers. He’s gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars for
injured workers. And this position is for a plaintiff’s attorney
position on the industrial commission. He is clearly a plaintiff’s
attorney. He’s served with two other plaintiff’s attorneys on the
advisory commission that Representative Moore discussed. And the
advocates of justice, when Mr. Allen ran for the state house, maxed out
their contributions to him. I don’t think they would have done that for
someone who was anti-worker. This is someone who clearly can be
impartial. He is an advocate as an attorney but he realizes there are
situations where you’ve got to look at all the facts, and will do so. He
had one client who was an employer, so he’s certainly seen both sides.
But for the most part, injured workers are what he’s represented. And we
have the opportunity to put him on there, to give workers a strong
advocate for a situation where the industrial commission and workers
comp gives money to injured workers quickly so their medical needs can
be taken care of. It’s not a situation of faults and picking one side or
the other, but looking at the facts of the case. And we have some
members on the other side who have filled out similar surveys that make
them anti-worker, if Mr. Allen is considered anti-worker, and I would
ask them to look at theirselves. Mr. Allen is highly qualified, good for
this position, strong advocate and will be able to be impartial, which
he answered in committee. And I’d be glad to nominate Mr. Allen and
support this resolution, and urge you all to support it as well. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the resolution a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, when this
nomination came before the rules committee, there were no questions.
There was no information presented. Only the comments by the minority
leader, and only a fund raising email I saw that came out from the North
Carolina Democratic Party. That’s the only thing I saw. This should not
be partisan. And I can tell you in the years that I’ve spent in the
minority, I’ve never made anything like this partisan. Mr. Allen is
Governor McCoy’s nominee for this position. He has been thoroughly
vetted by the Governor’s folks. He came through the rules committee
meeting, was there to ask questions. No questions were prompted to him
by Representative Hall or anyone else. And it just so happens I happen
to know Mr. Allen. And I know him to be a good attorney and to be fair.
And I think any of us who, Mr. Allen was a Republican candidate for
state house a few years ago, and I think any of us who serve in this
body, Democrat, Republican, whatever, decide to move on to some other
office, a judge or whatever. There’s a different role when you’re a
legislator and when you sit in a judicial role. Those are two different
things. But we’re all entitled to opinions. We’re all entitled to
believes. I think because Mr. Allen may have a conservative viewpoint,
that perhaps the minority has a problem with, he is a conservative,
being appointed by a conservative governor. But at the same time, when
he’s on the industrial commission, he’ll be fair. And I think that this
body should back the Governor up on this, and should do the right thing
by the people of North Carolina and confirm this appointment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]To speak a second time on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The
gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution a second time. [SPEAKER

comments, were Mr. Allen nominated to serve as supporting business
interests in North Carolina, he might would fit that bill although he
still would not be</p>

<p id="65:00">
Provide the ability to resolve controversies by rendering impartial and
well reasons decisions but the idea of him changing his values from
being a candidate to say he will have different values serving on the
industrial commission, I think you have to take him at his word
either then or now and he made representations when he was a candidate
which I would hope that you would fill out candidate questionnaires
truthfully or at least put a disclaimer at the end that say well I don't
really believe this I just want the endorsement and if it comes up
later on don't use it against me or you mean what you say now, I'm not
sure but there certainly inconsistent and that being the case I'm not
sure what that means toward his service on the industrial commission,
again my concern is integrity of the industrial commission, and
the rights of workers as well as businesses being impartially
adjudicated before them, and for the citizens of North Carolina to have
confidence in the rulings that they hand down. Thank you.

when I was serving his Clark of Superior Court when he was named
Guardian at lightem to represent incompetent, alleged

with integrity and represented their interest well, that kind of doesn't
add up to what is being said today but I find him as man of integrity

suspending the rules during the last session I would hope that we would
not suspend the rules the first time there is any
disagreement between the parties. On this tight vote. Clearly this vote
would come up in a normal course of business tomorrow, we will be here
and give an opportunity for people to consider and confer overnight so
I'd ask that you vote against this motion to suspend the
rules.

Mr. Speaker, members, based upon the vote difference, I think the
ultimate outcome of the bill was quite obvious, and I would point out
that this. We had the long weekend and the Memorial Day Holiday and to
keep this bill on track with the other confirmation which
was sent over by special messenger it really needs to go in tandem to
fit with the schedule that the house and Senate have developed to try to
move these matters forward and I would ask the members to move forward
with suspending the rules and certainly if anyone
wants to debate the resolution any further today they certainly can but
I would ask that we go ahead and move that forward, it's a matter of
trying to keep the train on the tracks.

a motion from Representative Moore on the house resolution 1112.

motion to reconsider, not 78. Therefore, in order to do this properly,
we’re going to reverse the vote so that we can then vote on it properly.
