Ladies and gentlemen. Could sergeant at arms close the doors and
everyone take their seat. We're going to begin the meeting. Sergeant at
arms, we've got Steve Wilson, where are you? Okay, Steve. Giles Jeffrey,
where's Giles? Okay good thank you Giles. And Charles Harper. Motorcycle
man. Thank you Charles. Okay let's see, we've got a lot of pages. Let me
get those introduced and then we'll begin our meeting. Parker Castlebury
from Raleigh, Senator Tillman. Parker, where are you? All right, good.
Yeah there you go. Spencer Mangum from Raleigh, Senator Daniel. Chandler
Bird, Wake Forest, Brent Jackson. Catlyn Edburt, Hickory, very good to
have you here. And you're Senator Allran. Thomas MacBrayer, Hickor,
Senator Allran, is that correct? I pronounce your name correctly? Close
enough? He does, doesn't he. Paul Wood, Senator Allran. Paul. You've got
everybody in Hickory here. Good. Quinton Beale, Raleigh, if I pronounced
that correctly. I don't know where he or she is, but. Sophia Politis,
Harrisburg. Good to have you, Senator Hartsell. Senator Hartsell, you
had a page and didn't even know it. Right. Okay, I'll take your word for
it. If anybody has any amendments, if you would, we want to get them in
as early as possible so give us an opportunity to look at these, so if
anybody has or brought some with them if you would please, give them to
the clerk or give them to the sergeant at arms and we'll go from there.
Senator Apodaca, are you ready to begin? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Mr.
Chairman. Any time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, you go right ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I talked enough yesterday. I'll be more than
happy to take any further questions or comments, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do want to clear the air on one issue
that seems to have popped up overnight about the moratorium and what it
applies to. Well it's the intent of this piece of legislation is to have
the moratorium apply to all fill, from zero to whatever. And we'll deal
with the classification of those areas during the moratorium period. So
we're not trying to be lax and allow any particular coal ash ponds or
facilities to skirt the law. That's not the intent at all, and I think
we can clarify that in the language. That's basically all I have to say
at this moment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay let me see if anybody has any
questions in the committee concerning, Senator Wade. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Apodaca, I'm glad you brought that up
because I had some questions actually myself last night from some
constituents. On these structural fills, it's, you might have to help me
a little bit here but I understand that for a year we're not allowing
them without a liner, is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, that
is correct. And I would like to kick it over to staff and let them give
you the exact language we have in there if they would. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Staff. I don't know which staff.  Jennifer, is that? All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Wade. That's
right, the prohibition on structural fill is complete prohibition or
moratorium on structural fill except where projects have base liner, a
leech aid collection system, a cap liner, ground water monitoring
system, and where the constructor or operator establishes financial
assurance as required by the park. Or as the base or sub-base of a
concrete or asphalt paved constructor under the authority of a public
entity so those would be encapsulated projects as well. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Senator Wade, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] About three questions, if you don't mind. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I can go to the structural
fill just one more time. Maybe the staff should answer this. Could you
give us some examples of structural fill? I know you mentioned concrete
but just exactly what they are so everybody here understands? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sure, good question. Jennifer, is that you?</p>

<p id="05:00">
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Wade, structural fill is a defined term
under the bill. So I’ll just read you the potential possibilities for
structural fill. It is an engineered fill with a projected beneficial
end use constructed using coal combustion products that are properly
placed and compacted. That term under this part would include abandoned
mines, also for embankments, greenscapes, foundations, construction
foundations and for bases or sub-bases under a structure of footprint of
a paved road, parking lot, sidewalk, parking lot, walkway or similar
structure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, do you? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you good with that? Do you have other
questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have other questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca. I know we said
something about cap in place on some of these ponds yesterday. And I was
just wondering. I’ve gone and some of them have trees and vegetation.
Are we requiring them to cut down all the trees or are we just going to
monitor like we would a landfill, a solid waste landfill that they use
for a park now? I mean, how are we going to do that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, that’s a great question and what we want to do is when we put
the moratorium on, this is the issue we want our new commission to look
at along with Deaner and make recommendations, to rate those sites, to
see what actually needs to be done with them. Whether they need to be
dug up and liners put down and move it back. That is something the
commission and Deaner will look at over the moratorium period. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Certainly, go ahead Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any chance, I know I’ve seen the pictures of
some, have trees and it looks like a park, but this commission could
study to see if they could be used like that, like some of our solid
waste facilities that have been closed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is their
charge, is to look at that and make those recommendations along with the
recommendations from Deaner. Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
looked at an article from Scientific American yesterday and I know you
hate that part, but I’m getting ready to ask. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that
your standard reading source? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not all the time, sir.
[LAUGHTER] But it did mention in here that there’s been some studies
done by the University of Florida on fly ash and using it in the soil to
help grow like, tomatoes and also they did a study in India to grow
peanuts. And for the tomatoes, and how they made this formula where it
wasn’t toxic, the tomatoes grew up to 70% larger and that in India that
the peanuts yield 31-24% more. Is there anything, do you know or does
the staff know if there’s anything like that going on in this area,
especially with NC State being here? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, as we
discussed yesterday and Senator Ford’s going to offer an amendment
dealing with some of that, we really can’t emphasis enough how we want
to look at alternatives to the use of coal ash. And what we can and
cannot do with it. And fine more things we can do that are safe to the
public and can help. So that is one of the areas we are encouraging
further development and study in, and hopefully we can come up with some
new things that we’ve never thought of, with coal ash. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d just like to follow up with one quick statement. I’d like for you to
maybe contact the University of Florida. And they were using it with
manure and with compost and it was actually not toxic. Of course they
checked the ground water and everything at a certain level, and they
seemed to think it would be fine to use it as a fertilizer as long as
the levels were checked on, and that type of procedure was put in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve always thought Florida had an abundance of
manure, so that might be something we could look at, but you’re
absolutely right, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, let’s move right
along. Senator Apodaca, did you in fact speak to Robert Reuben, I don’t
know if he’s in this committee meeting today or not, but he’d called me.
He is a professor at State and deals in recyclables along the very lines
that Senator Wade’s referring to. I regret he’s not here but anyway I
thought I might get him to speak for a minute. But Senator Apodaca,
let’s see, does anyone else have a question concerning anything at the
moment? If not we’re going to move ahead. Senator Hartsell? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Are you ready to discuss amendments?</p>

<p id="10:00">
Yeah, yeah, if, I would like to do that early. If you would, if you've
got an amendment and if anyone else has an amendment if you would,
because we're going to try to vote this out if we can today. Let's see,
Senator Hartsell, did you want to-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have an amendment, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay do you want to, yeah just, if you don't mind sergeant at arms if
you all would pick that up and then we're going to continue on with
questions and then we'll talk about the amendments in just a moment.
Okay Senator Apodaca, do you want to continue on with your bill or
what's your pleasure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I'm good if we want to start with amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, that sounds good. Senator Hartsell, do you want to explain your
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, Mr. Chairman. I have discussed this somewhat with Senator Apodaca
and what it's designed to do. It's similar to what Senator Wade
indicated but otherwise, and I'm open to changes in the form of the
amendment, but the gist of it is it creates a goal for the reduction of
the ash, that's on the generation side, and a preference for the use of
encapsulated ash in various incendiary in public procurement. That would
be having to do with roads, highways. I'm hoping that this works to
create a market for that encapsulated ash that expands beyond what it is
now. And that's what it's designed to do and create that situation. I'm
not saying that this is drafted perfectly but it's the best I could do
in the short time we had.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Okay I think we've got, let's see how many other. We've got
several amendments but first let's see if anyone has any questions of
Senator Hartsell's amendment. Does everybody, does all the members have
copies of his amendment? I guess that means everybody does or nobody has
it. At any rate, Senator Apodaca, do you want to comment on this
amendment or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On it's face I have no problem with it but I would like a few moments to
go through it with staff. Could we have about five minutes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we'll look at all the amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then come back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright let's, does anyone else, how many amendments do we have? We've
got three amendments? Alright. You've got one, if you could turn it in.
Okay, do all the members, we've supposedly got three amendments. If all
the members would read those amendments and who are they from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hartsell, Ford, and Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Senator Ford, do you want to explain your amendment while they're
looking over-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Senator Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I don't believe we have the other amendments you were
referring to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, we'll correct that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me just say I actually had two amendments that I was planning to
run. This is, however, the one that's been distributed is the only one I
plan to run today just in case there's some concern on ?? was.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Alright, we should have, we'll wait until all the Senate members
get copies of three amendments. We have one from Senator Hartsell, one
from Senator Brock, and from Senator Ford. Senator Ford's amendment is
being passed out now. Senator Allran, I'm glad you joined us. We've got
about fifteen pages here representing you so we introduced them all but,
I did exaggerate a big but anyway you're well represented today. Thank
you for being here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. You should introduce Paul Wood twice 'cause
he's the one who got left off yesterday in the chamber.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There he is, there, back there, very good.</p>

<p id="15:00">
Remember yesterday in the chamber, the last one got left off. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yeah, I do. Okay, thank you. All right now, does everybody have
all 3 amendments? Senator Fuller, do you want to explain your amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, thank you Mr. Chairman. Just following up
members, with the conversation we had yesterday about section 4E. I'm
looking to amend the bill on page 33, line 46 to try to tighten up the
language as it relates to the RFPs being issued by all electric
generating facilities and to get some action and some movement on those
RFPs but also Mr. Chairman in striking a balance, because realistically
we know that there are going to be quite a few opportunities for
beneficial use. But looking to make sure that those folks are taking
some action on the RFPs that they're getting. So if I could get staff to
add any additional clarifying language to this amendment, I would
appreciate it Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you, Senator
Fuller. Senator Brock, did you want to explain your amendment? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, it's one
ARI, 16F. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right hold on just a minute, Senator
Brock. Let's wait until everyone has copies of Senator Brock's amendment
and then we'll let you proceed. [PAUSE] Okay. Does everybody now have a
copy? Senator Brock, go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Player to be named
later. Members of the committee, if you look at the first part it's the
definition of the coal combustion residuals surface impalement. Starting
really at the meat of the amendment starts at the next section, line 29.
It says this is for public utility generating coal combustion residuals.
So it make sure that it's for the actual utility and we may have some
private companies out there but we don't have the information on them
yet, so we just want to make sure that no one gets caught up in the
legislation unintended but we're going to continue to look at that as
well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, does anyone have any questions on this
amendment? Okay. We'll wait. Let's just wait a few minutes. [PAUSE]
Senator Apodaca, when you're ready, the committee's ready. Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Five minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That'd be fine. Tell
you what. Everyone just relax, we're just going to take since we've got
several minutes, we're going to, if anybody'd like to go to the restroom
or whatever, chat with your friends, we're going to close down for 5
minutes. We'll be right back. Let these folks look through the
amendments and we'll be back and instruct the committee again. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is this thing working? Yeah, it's working. Okay.
Let's call the meeting back to order. If the sergeant at arms close the
doors and everybody take their seat. We're going to start with Senator
Brock's amendment. Senator Brock, do you want to give a quick overview
of your amendment and we'll go ahead on this, make sure nobody has any
questions and everybody understands it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have
anything else than what I mentioned before unless staff wants to go into
further detail. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Staff, you want? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just to reiterate what Senator Brock said. This would clarify
the applicability of the legislation to just impoundments owned by
public utilities, which was the intent, but there were a few ambiguities
here and there in the PCS which we believe we've covered. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All right, great. Now does anyone have any questions before we
vote on this amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I think it's a
great amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Senator Apodaca. We don't get
many great amendments, but I guess we do now. Yeah clarify that, yeah.
But we do need a motion to</p>

<p id="20:00">
Senator Jackson we have the motion to push the amendment. We have no
questions. All those in favor of the amendment by senator Brock signify
by saying aye. Hearing none the amendment passes. Thank you senator
Brock. Now we have another amendment by senator Ford, senator Ford do
you want to explain your amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman I am gonna focus that as the
expression I have given on the staff to give another.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think this is probably a better amendment than
senator Brock’s.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman tell senator Brock not to be too mad.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have got two grade amendments one is greater than
the other one. Senator Ford you get the prize. ??. All those in favor of
senator Ford‘s amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh yes sorry. Senator Cook Moves for the option of the
amendment etc. All those in favor of senator Ford‘s amendment of the
great great amendment please say aye. Oppose? Okay we for one no and
senator Ford your amendment passes. Senator ?? you had an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I had one and I have chosen to withdraw it for the
time being.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So we are now back on the bill and I think we have
some speakers George let's see we have George Evert with Duke energy.
George would you come forward and speak we had you down for two minutes
but since we have no other speakers we are gonna allow you to speak
longer as you need
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I try to hold it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Of you would make sure your mike is on and
give us your name and who you represent for the minutes. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman Members of the committee my name is
George Evert I work for Duke Energy and have for the last 15 years. I
appreciate the opportunity to share our initial thoughts on this
comprehensive and aggressive legislation as senator Burger and senator
Apodaca has say yesterday of all the other States in the country in
terms of what we plan to do with this coal residual material. As thou
know hope you know this have taken us about 80 years to generate this
amount of coal ash at our facilities but we recognize the focus is on is
now because of the release we had from the pipe that collapse at our
darn river facility. So we understand why we are in the bull’s eye right
now. In order to modify what we have been doing for 80 years. We have 33
ponds at our facilities that are currently storing ash. In order to move
away from that process is gonna take orderly thoughtful engineering
expertise to get there and I want you to know that we have been doing
that. When we merged with progress energy at that time the two utilities
there together had of total 14 coal fire plants in the state. The 33
ponds are scattered at those sites. We have retard in the last 5 years
half of those plants. So half of our coal fire plants as a joint utility
have now retard later on generate any ash no flesh no bottom ash no wet
ash no dry ash. That's a great step in right direction. That leaves 7
more plans on our system better still operating and generating ash of
those 7 facilities only three units had the seven facilities still
generate wet ash.</p>

<p id="25:00">
We have converted all of the rest to dry flash handling. We have
committed to close the wet handling of ash at those three facilities so
that we will no longer have any wet flash being generated in our system.
So, we are in the right direction. We have a record (I think you are
aware of that) of working with this General Assembly to address key
energy issues in this state. Back in 2003, we worked with the General
Assembly to adopt landmark legislation to address emissions from our
coal fire facilities. We have committed to those projects, spent 2.8
billion dollars as two utilities and finished the projects three years
early. So, we worked with you address these kinds of issues. We have in
the past. In 2007 we worked to provide the opportunities to our
customers to have more renewable energy.  So, we are committed to moving
forward similarly in this process, and we have started. Under this
legislation (if you have looked over it as we have) we have noticed the
very aggressive schedules. If you think about it for a minute, the bill
identifies four high priority sites and tells us what to do at those
sites. Now, think about the material that is at those sites. We have got
to go to the department, propose a prioritization of all the sites. The
department makes the final recommendation to a commission (a commission
that has not been appointed yet), but the commission will approve the
final prioritization of the site. That prioritization will go out for
public comment and hearing, not as one list but on a site by site basis.
After the prioritization has been finalized (after the hearings), then
we have to submit a closure plan for each of those sites, and the
closure plan will depend on the prioritization. That closure plan also
is approved by the department and the commission after another set of
public comment and hearing. Let us assume that we have finished the
prioritization, we have finished the closure plan and approval, we now
have to initiate the project to actually close the site. Depending on
what we have to do to close the site (for instance, move that material
to a land fill) we have to find the site for the land fill, get the
permit for the landfill, construct the land fill and move the material
(depending on how much is at the site) to the landfill all within five
years. It is a very aggressive schedule, we are committed to doing all
we can while still operating facilities. All this work has to go on
while we still generate power for those facilities. Our suggestion,
there are four high priority sites. We know that the department and the
commission are going to prioritize the ranking for all of the priority
sites.  That is a process that is going to go forward with public input.
Until we know the rankings of the sites and the closure plans of those
sites, it is very hard for us to assess our ability to meet the
schedule. It seems like we have the process a little out of order. We
respectfully ask that the timelines that are in the bill (as aggressive
as they are) be revisited (simply re-look at them) at the time when the
risk prioritization and closure plan have been approved. We just want to
be sure those dates are achievable after the first steps are taken.  Mr.
Chairmen, I appreciate the opportunity to comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you George. Let’s see first if any committee members have any
questions of George while he is here. Okay, Senator Allran. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairmen. Mr. Edward, thank you for all that you
have done and are doing to move in the right direction.  My question is,
how does reducing coal ash, that is desirable for reuse recycling, how
does that fit into this as opposed to the emphasis on storage?</p>

<p id="30:00">
Well of course over time, our technology has changed, as I mentioned.
Historically, the first coal plants that were built were not very
efficient. Now we’re talking about the 20s and 30s. The coal that was
burned in those facilities did not fully burn efficiently the carbon
that’s in that coal. So there’s carbon left in that old coal that can be
re-burned. It’s a very expensive process but it is technologically
feasible. It’s being done in some places. We’re interested in doing
that. The content of carbon in that ash is the thing that makes it
unavailable for certain uses. So we call the term is you beneficiate
that old ash and bring it up to a carbon content that you can use in
current uses. So the first issue is can you modify that old ash to a
state that you can use in concrete. You can do it, it takes time and
money but we’re committed to doing that. We are using ash we produce
today that is newer, more efficiently burned, and meets the specs of the
concrete market. In addition, that equipment that we put on our plants
as a result of both federal and state requirements to reduce our air
emissions, leaves some contaminants I’ll call them, things that the
concrete market doesn’t like, in the ash. That material is harder to
use. We are currently selling into the reuse market, almost 70% of what
we produce. So today we have cleaner material, more efficiently burned,
but we have a lot of material that can’t go there yet. We certainly are
committed to moving more in that direction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Allran you have a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, if I could. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just taken by one of our earlier
meetings where the gentleman from Charlotte who is the manufacturer of
the concrete in a very articulate fashion, let us know that he was
having to buy coal ash from other states to make his concrete, because
it helped in the process of the concrete, and we didn’t have that type
of coal ash here. I’m trying to find out whether or not we are really in
the process of changing things so that the coal ash that we produce in
the future and the coal ash that we produced in the past can be used for
that purpose, for our folks here in the state, or whether or not the
real emphasis is simply on encapsulating it someplace for all time, as
opposed to recycling it. While at the same time we have a manufacturer
or manufacturers of concrete buying coal ash from other states because
they can’t get it here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re certainly committed to
selling all the ash that we can into that market. And we have looked at
the technology to make that older ash more sellable. In fact, we have
facilities that currently will modify some of that ash. And the question
is how much can we modify and have a market for? And if you, we’re in
communication with the gentleman from Charlotte who spoke at the last
meeting, to be sure we can match his demand. Because as we invest into
that market to build the facility, the concrete market, depending on the
construction business, goes up and down. What we’ve tried to do is have
enough of that material to feed the market efficiently. And we are
looking at building a facility near our Marshall Station now, to put
more concrete into that market. Or, more ash into that concrete market.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Senator Allran does that, to your question?
Okay. We’ve got a couple other questions and then we’re going to take a
vote on this. George, if you’ll just hold tight, we’ve got a couple
other people want to ask you questions. Senator Hartsell? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually it’s a follow up on the
amendment I was</p>

Looking to run.
What would it take, what do we need to do- What do you need to do, what
do we need to do to beneficiate that ash and create the mark- expand the
market so that it is, we can use more of that ash rather than dump it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The most important thing for us right now is to reduce the carbon
content in that ash.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have a follow up Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And how do you do that, do you just reburn it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You burn it again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate the ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, If- You've got a distinctive voice, but you do need to
talk into the mic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, I know that there are some in the audience
with less management experience that may think you can do it faster. I'm
just wondering if there isn't a way to take the process that you've
looked at, do the lean six segment drill, or, instead of doing
everything serially, do some of the things in parallel to try to shorten
that time just a little bit.  Five years, I know is not gonna, seems
like an eternity to some people but for what you're trying to do it's
not overly long but there might, if you just look at a way to kinda
streamline it through these other management practices it might be
useful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
???, did you? no comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I understand
Do we have any other questions? Senator Wade?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I have a question for George, and I also have a question
for Senator Apodaca, and then at the appropriate time I'd like to move
for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got all that. Go right ahead, yes ma'm
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know if you're aware of North Carolina A&amp;T's research that
they have done on coal ash? I wasn't. I read it in the paper.  At first
I didn't believe it, but I do want to just mention this to you.  It says
that researchers at North Carolina A&amp;T have developed a miracle
material that's light weight, waterproof, fire resistant, anti-corrosive
and non toxic, and, oh yeah, deflects explosives.  And perhaps most
noticeably, the stuff is ninety-five percent coal ash.  So I just
wondered it we've had any conversations whatsoever with North Carolina
A&amp;T.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a team of people who are taking a host of proposals of concepts
and ideas to modify this ash and make a lot broader use than just
concrete. So we have a team of people reviewing all of those proposals
and any one that looks favorable of course we would love to have the
opportunity to move a hundred million tons of ash.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, I think you had another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Senator, or staff, if they want to review the process of capping
in place.
I've had some constituents call and I'd just like to go over what's
allowable and what the federal regulations are and where our regulations
fall at the state level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, Senator Wade, if the members will turn to page
eighteen of the PCS, the cap in place is the option for low risk
impoundments.  As you can see it requires as part of the cap in place
that they comply with the closure and post closure requirements
established by section point one six two seven of the administrative
code.  Those are the closure and post closure requirements for municipal
solid waste landfills.  So the cap that is allowed for municipal solid
waste land fills will also be required for low risk impoundments.  I
know that one of the speakers mentioned yesterday about soil and a tarp
covering these sites, but they will be subject to the same closure
requirements as a municipal solid waste landfill.  As to the
requirements under the proposed rules that are with USEPA right now,
they also have a cap in place option, in fact that cap in place option,
if they go with what's called the subtitle D approach, which is treating
coal ash -</p>

… hazardous waste. It would allow all sites, all coal ash impoundments
to be kept in place. My review of their capping minimums I think is
consistent with our capping requirements. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Wade, does that answer your question, or do you…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir, and if it’s an appropriate time, I would like to move for a
favorable report on the PCS as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sounds good.
It’s very much an appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I make ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I’d just like to make a few closing comments here, and with
respect to Mr. Edward’s comments; I appreciate those. I have found in my
life that I get more things done when I have a tight guideline, so as I
said yesterday, we’ll be here every year, but I think these guidelines
can be met. Also I think there are four facilities right now that you
could probably start clearing out today and moving those, and we’ve
identified those four as we go forth rating the others and going down
the road to get us rid of these, so I appreciate everybody’s effort on
this and I really want to thank staff for all their work. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. I think Jennifer wanted
to clarify something that she had spoken to your question, so we’re
going to let her clear that up. Go ahead, Jennifer. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, I indicated to you that US CPA’s proposed rules, I
mentioned subsection D, which is correct, but I said “hazardous waste”.
That would be treatment of impoundments and their contents as “solid
waste”. So not hazardous; solid. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m certainly glad
you clarified that. I was confused until you said that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yeah, we caught that right off. But anyway, thank you,
Jennifer. We’ve got to guests in the audience, one favorable and one not
quite so favorable, but anyway, I’m going to mention them. We’ve got
Senator Stevens, who used to join us for a lot of time. Richard, good to
have you here today. It’s always a pleasure to see you. And then we have
the Assistant Secretary, Mitch Gillespie. Mitch, good to have you here
today. And Mitch has been a longtime member of the House and
well-respected. Mitch, thanks for coming. We have a motion for a
favorable report as amended. All those in favor… [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Pardon? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? PCS as amended. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] PCS as amended, correct. All those in favor, signify by saying
aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed? Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen. We stand adjourned.</p>
