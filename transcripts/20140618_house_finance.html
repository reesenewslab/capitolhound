Welcome to house finance should be in resting ??. I would like to thank
our pages, Christen Based, Sabrina Coles, Steven Dipri, Sarah Woods and
Cole Shalcorks. Of anything it's pronounced incorrectly please forgive
me. I would also like to thank our sergeant arms Mr. Seals, Mr. Lee, Mr.
Brandon and Mr. Clampat thank you all for watching about our door.
Members of the committee we will now take the PCS for Senate bills 493.
Representative Shepard moves you have the PCS before discussion. All in
favor say aye. All oppose. Motion carried. The bill is before
Representative Murry. Present you Christmas tree bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There are three provisions in this bill that deal with
finance committee related changes. Section 1.7 of the bill establishes
the landscape contractors licensing the board authorize the board to
collect fees. Section 1.8 establishes different utility regulatory fees
for retail services of certain tele communication providers and section
3.2 establishes behavior analysis licensing board and authorizes the
board to collect fees. There are multiple auditions and provisions in
the bill but specifically related to the finance committee those are the
three provisions that deal with finance related matters. Authorizing
landscape contractors licensing there's been multiple complaints from
members of public that this is a registration only board and that if
there is landscape contractor issue, the boards can actually do anything
about it so this is a suggested remedies by the landscape contractors
and it only applies to landscape contractors doing jobs 25000 dollar and
greater. The regulatory fees for retail services and certain tele
communication is exact contends of house bill 1092 which is a product of
a ihram over side committee. Section 3.2 the behavior and licensing
board because this bill also contains the all term insurance provisions
in house bill 498. As a result of that we need to have a behavior
licensing board to help address proper over side for that service being
provided by behavior analysis. With that if I left any major details out
Mr. Chairman we do have a extremely capable and helpful staff is being
put in this bill together over past couple of weeks. With that I will be
answering questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman at the appropriate time I would
like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee while we wait for copies of
this amendment I would like to take a ?? from the last meeting.
Representative Bobbie moves approve the from the last meeting of June 11
2014. All in favor say aye. All oppose. Morton carried sold. Thank you.
Any member have questions for representative Murry while we wait for the
amendment to be copied.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I wondered if the staff to go over the
adjustments to the utilities regulatory fees, I can just hear staff
explanation that in particular is different what we do analysis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Heather yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke this is also identical to house
bill 1052 and there's a separate summary in your package for 1052 and
there's a chart and they might be helpful but in short in past 20 years
the state ?? government have basically being in the process of
deregulating foreign service and the state have adopted two alternative
form of regulation for foreign service so for companies</p>

<p id="05:00">
for this alternative form of regulation their reg fee will be reduced.
Basically we're taking out the jurisdictional revenues for just those
two types of telecommunication companies who have elected to be
regulated under subsection H or subsection M in chapter 62 and that will
be subject to a lower reg fee. So if you look on the second page of the
summary for 1052, subsection H jurisdictional revenue will be subject to
.06% and .04% in 2016-17. Subsection M is subject to .05% in 15-16 and
.02% in 16-17. So this is not effective for this fiscal year. The bill
does not set the corresponding rate for all the other jurisdictional
revenues that would apply to all other public utilities and the
wholesale rate of telephone companies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. Right here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If it's okay I think Representative Luebke has seen this in Public
Utilities. We ran this bill in Public Utilities a few weeks ago. I just
want to let him know that. That we actually passed this out of Public
Utilities, they put it in the reg reform bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Representative Hager, I remembered
in Public Utilities. My question then is, again for staff, so this has
nothing to do with the utilities fee that we typically put int he budget
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Heather.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This does not set the fee for this year. It is that same reg fee. So
basically what it is doing in fiscal years 15 moving forward it's going
to basically create subsets of that reg fee. So we're going to have one
reg fee that applies to public utilities other than telecommunication
providers and it will also apply to the wholesale revenue of
telecommunication providers and then we will have new separate rates for
the retail competitive jurisdictional revenues for those
telecommunication providers. So we're actually just creating subsets of
the reg fee, basically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And, thank you Mr. Chairman, and overall is there a staff assessment of
what the fiscal impact would be for this, the other members of the staff
might comment, what's the impact likely to be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is and we do have a fiscal note. I'm just trying to find it. It is
in your packet and it does state, again, this does not impact this
fiscal year. These changes do not come into effect until the 15-16 year.
So it would, by creating a lower rate for these competitive
jurisdictional revenues, it will have an impact on the regulatory fee
but the bill also provides that it is the intent of the General Assembly
to adjust the main regulatory fee to make up that difference. So let me
find that fiscal note and I will point that out to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, right here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Bizzell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Rodney Bizzell with fiscal research and the fiscal
note, as Heather mentioned, there is no impact in FI 14-15. Beginning in
FI 15-16 the impact would be between $800,000 and 1.5 million dollars
per year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, just a question, I guess more for Representative Hager. Why would
you not want to make this revenue neutral in terms of the overall impact
of the fee and the purposes to which the fee has been going over the
years?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Luebke. Trey Rabin[?] is in the audience, Mr.
Chairman, if he would be good but what our intention was, Representative
Luebke, is to, and with the agreement of the other members that bring
in, especially Duke Energy and some of the other bigger utilities, is to
raise their fee during that time to compensate for this. But Mr.
Chairman, Trey Rabin's in the audience if you'd like to have him speak
to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Rabin, would you like to address this matter?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Trey Rabin with AT&amp;T, representing
subsection M companies. Representative Luebke, if I may address that
question directly. We've been working with the regulated and the
deregulated industries. It's our understanding that there is a provision
within the bill that would allow for the utilities commission to adjust
regulatory rates to ensure that they are made whole. There is a sunset
process. It's a step-down process beginning July 1st, 2015 that would
allow them to accommodate for a reduction in the fee for the deregulated
companies while adjusting the overall regulatory fee for those regulated
industries appropriately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I hear and appreciation your comments my question, still I think,
is to the bill sponsor</p>

bill's promoter. It shows here on the fiscal note that it is going to be
a loss of anywhere between $800,000 and a million dollars, about a
million dollars on out. Is there something in the bill that will call
for a adjustment so that the fee is revenue neutral or are we talking
about a million dollar loss?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Resident Luebke, I'm trying to find the page and the line number for you
as we speak. Section 1.8, let me get through section, I needed section
1.7 first and then we'll talk about that. Mr. Chairman, 1.8 section-,
let me look at it really quick, I read it this morning and Heather
Finnell may know exactly where it's at so if she wants to go ahead and
take-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Finnell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, and yes Representative Luebke, if you look at section 1.8F on
page 19 of the Reg Reform bill, I can hand you my copy if you'd like,
Mr. Turner, you got it? So what this is is the reg fee is actually set
by the General Assembly each year and what happens is the Utilities
Commission comes to the General Assembly as part of the budget process
and says this is what we think the reg fee needs to be. And, as you can
see from the summary, actually it's part of the budget process this
year, the Senate set the reg fee at .13% and the House has set the reg
fee at .14% and that has not been determined this year. So what this
bill does is say we don't know what the reg fee needs to be in year
15-16, we're going to allow that to be set in the budget but this sets
the intent. The intent of the bill is to be revenue neutral in the
future and to encourage the General Assembly in the 15-16 year to set
the reg at an amount that will hold the Utilities Commission and the
public staff whole with the same amount of revenue. But you're correct,
it does not actually set that because that is generally set in the
budget each year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Finnell, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, you're recognized for your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To amend the bill on page 26, lines 31-38 by
deleting those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions or comments from the committee. Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'd like to know what, in effect, we're doing when we're doing that
and what the presenter of the bill, what his opinion of that is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have no opinions on any amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That answered my second question as-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You just opened a flood gate but that's fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I still would like to know what we're doing here, basically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These are the rules for the division of employment security that should
have been in place fourteen months ago and all of the rules should go
through the UI oversight committee and without deleting here that is not
going to occur. So I would ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard moves for the adoption of her amendment. Further
discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, Robert.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there anyone here from Employment Security Commission to comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is anyone present from Employment Security?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well it's, anybody from Employment Security know to be here that knowing
that it seems to me this is a pretty significant change, should we-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do it all the time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask this question, is this part that's here before us for
Finance, it looks to me like the part that's finance committee changes
on your summary are the first three or is the entire bill open for
discussion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll see how far we get.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or is this here-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well when we had the appropriations powered it was only here for-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I believe Cindy Avret[?] can explain. We've asked for
these rules from the division for several months in order to put them in
legislation for the short session and then this just overrides any
oversight of that commission. The reason that the oversight committee
was established was in order to be able to look at rules that were being
proposed in order for us not to get back in to a situation that we are
currently in. I've spoken with the Senate, the Senate is not aware of
this</p>

<p id="15:00">
...had no contact with anyone so what we're trying to do is just put it
back where it needs to go and that way all the rules would first come
through the bi-partisan  oversight committee. And that's all it will do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a parliamentary inquiry again for the chair.
May I ask my question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Like when the appropriations bill was here all that was open for
discussion for discussion were the finance changes. It appears to me
that this bill says the finance ?? changes are 1.8 and 3.2. My question
is, I've got lots of questions throughout this whole bill. Is the whole
bill before us or just the finance committee? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
amendment is before us now. And amendments will be taken as time allows
but we are going to vote this bill out today. It will leave this
committee before the appointed hour. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So is the answer
to the question that the entire bill is open...[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you
want to bring an amendment forward you'll see how it goes.
Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I
support the amendment and also the bill is properly before the
committee. I have never seen the finance committee handcuffed by any
type of arbitrary rules. When a bills in the committee it's [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It's fair game. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Open market. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes Sir. Further discussion or debate? YOu heard the motion
from Representative Howard for the adoption of the amendment All in
favor say aye. Aye. All opposed? Motion carried. Amendment is adopted.
At this time Representative Hager, you are recognized, send forth your
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman. Section 9 was a
bill that came through I believe it was last long session that we I
believe, decided not to move forward. This amendment removes the
landscape license fee 'cause I believe that we should license things
that have to do with the health, safety and wellbeing of the citizens of
North Carolina we should not arbitrarily license things we think need to
be licensed so this removes that section. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Discussion,
debate from the committee. Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
just would like to slow down on some of these things that we're rushing
through. I'd like to hear more than justification for eliminating this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's why I said discussion and debate, I wasn't
trying to rush you through, to be honest with you I wasn't. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No, no I know you weren't sir. I know that the amendment comes
in out of nowhere so I'd like the staff to explain what this amendment
does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll determine which one is saddled with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, my
understanding is it just removes the entire landscape contractor section
from the bill. This bill has been debated in multiple forms and multiple
venues. There is a reasonable level of discussion on whether it's a good
idea or not so without taking sides, I'm just bringing forth ideas that
other people have decided to call regulatory reform and if this body
determines, if this all gust body in the house finance committee decide
that landscape contractors is not regulatory reform than that's the
legislative process and I'm comfortable with that. But that's for this
committee to debate and I'm willing to listen to it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Karen Cochran Brown can address this section. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. As Representative Murray indicated Health Bill 61
was a bill that was considered during the last long session that would
have transferred the landscape committee contractor registration board
into a licensing board. This amendment would just delete that provision
that is included in this bill from this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes. I'm sorry. ?????? Alright. Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ??? the bill that she referenced debated in the long
....[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill you mentioned that was debated in the
long session, did that in fact pass the house and go on to the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It did not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok, so this is actually
bringing back a bill that has already failed once? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It
has not failed to my knowledge it was debated I know in the House of
Commerce Committee, no vote was taken on the bill. It has a finance
application obviously so the bill is still alive in the House of
Commerce, currently. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If anybody ever needed proof
that the resurrection is real, this is it. This bill has failed in
congress.....</p>

<p id="20:00">
this bill has been in front of Finance before and never got a favorable
report. With this bill, for years they pushed this bill and it's never
been successful but it's resurrected again. I think we should support
the Hager amendment. This is not regulatory reform. This is an attempt
of somebody to try to change policy which is a very substantial change
in policy but every time it's been vetted in a separate committee it
never gets enough votes to pass. I think we ought to take it out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's not the first time we've seen something come back from the dead.
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm actually going to speak against the amendment. This is exactly what
you all said, it's a licensing thing, and unfortunately these licensing
contractors, these contractors have tried to get licensed for a number
of years and their timing just happened to hit when the republicans came
in and we didn't like licensing. And yet there are all these other
entities that have licensing and we're not going around and revoking
theirs and they've worked with people to try to make this as agreeable
as possible by raising the limit so that your average lawn care company
is not covered by this and so I would just urge your defeat of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, Robert.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would also speak against the amendment. It only affects contracts over
$25,000. It does not affect your personal landscaping. We have contract
license requirements for general contractors for if their contract is
over $25,000 and without this provision in here they're going to have to
have a general contractors license anyway. This simply allows them to
operate as a landscaping contractor with a license when they're
contracting for over $25,000 worth of work and I oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there a Mr. Michael Currin in the audience who'd like to speak on
this amendment? Mr. Currin, please state your name and title for the
record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, my name is Michael Currin. I am from GIC, the Green Industry
Council, as well as from Greenscape Inc., a family owned business that I
started 35 years ago this year that my son now runs. I hear the concerns
but I think that you need to keep in mind that 85% of the industry is
under about $500,000 a year. The $25,000 per job keeps them well within
the ability to operate just as they always have. The other thing that is
really important is, for the benefit of the industry, for the benefit of
those companies that are doing work that is larger than $25,000, if you
remember or you may recall that the general contractor's license
provides for jobs over $30,000 to require a general contractor. The
general contractor's industry is not interested in the landscape
contracting business. They're interested in structures, habitable
buildings, and those types of things. We do work all the time that is
far beyond that limit. We need this bill in order to allow us to operate
as we are doing. The other thing that is really important, the public is
affected by the work that's done. I serve on the Irrigation Licensing
Board in the five years that that bill has been in effect. The people
who have become before that board who have been reported for violation,
it is so obvious that they do not need to be doing irrigation
contracting based on their lack of competency, their fraudulent business
practices, and these types of things. So this bill ties with the
irrigation contracting licensing bill to facilitate, for those of us int
he industry who improve the environment, create outdoor living spaces
that help to get people out into the environment, improve their health,
and keep people in a much better condition than if they sit behind a
computer all day. We protect, through what we do, the water, the quality
of water, and that is upcoming problem in this state. And so what we are
doing in this industry has a direct impact. So this bill is small
business friendly. It does not keep people from starting out as I did.</p>

With a one person company with one employee who was over 70 on Social
Security and building a business that I can pass on to my children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So I just encourage you
to consider your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Stay at the
podium. Representative Collins, you're recognized. Mr. Kern, please stay
at the podium. There may be questions from the committee and
Representative Collins has a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I have a question either for Mr. Kern or whoever can answer
this question. One of the many jobs I had back when I used to teach
school, one of the many summer jobs, was running a lawn maintenance crew
for a landscaping company and my question is would this include a
company. Let's say I have a contract with a guy who owns several
McDonalds and he also has me his private residence. And I cut his grass
and trim and do bushes and take care of his irrigation system and all
that kind of stuff and my contract is $1,000 a week, which makes it well
over that. Are we talking about a one time job or are we talking about
$25,000 a year, or what does that $25,000 mean would be my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you'd like to stay I can answer that question for
him. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, all right, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's
$25,000 per year per job. So I would say if you have a McDonalds and
you're getting $1,000 a month for it then you're robbing the guy that
you're doing work for because that's an extremely high price for
maintenance at a McDonalds. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I follow up? Maybe you
didn't hear what I said. I said he owns 3 or 4 McDonalds and we do his
house, which takes half a day, a half a full day with a crew every
single week. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those are all individual jobs, so it's
$25,000 per location per follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So if he's paying
me $500 to do his personal maintenance for his residence, then it does
fall under this provision. It would be $25,000 a year, is that correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] $500 a week. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The mic is not on, I'm
sorry. We're not hearing what you're saying. Don't start over, just
continue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It does not cover maintenance, it covers
landscape contracting, so if you're mowing grass you're exempt from this
bill. So the $25,000 doesn't apply there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So you're
telling me they'll separate what I'm doing as far as putting in
irrigation and taking care of that? I guess, to me this is really
nebulous. What if I'm planting trees and bushes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, let's let Karen Cochran-Brown answer this so we
can get clarification. Miss Karen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Representative Collins, the specific provision if you care to
look at the bill is on page 10 beginning on line 37, and it basically
provides any landscaping work with a price of all contracts for labor,
materials and other items for a given job site during any consecutive 12
month period is less than $25,000. I think what that means is that you
can't have any single contract in that 12 month period that would exceed
$25,000. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak more theoretically
based on a point that Representative Hager raised, and I came across
something, an economic principle called regulatory capture. And I
actually discovered this through looking through taxicabs, I'm going to
use that example, but it applies here. A regulatory board will make
regulations, the general population doesn't really care, they don't pay
attention, but the people in the industry do. And what happens over time
is the board, instead of protecting the public, protects the industry.
Begins to restrict entry, control who can do it and who can't, we've
seen the example in some taxi contracts recently where things become
very restricted because the regulatory board begins to represent the
regulated and not the general populus. And with the free market and the
rules that we already have, I think Representative Hager's making a good
point, if we're going to do this this has to be vetted as a separate
bill and discussed in great detail. We don't have time to make this
decision today. I'm going to support his amendment and if we want to
come back and look at this in the long session, let's do it, but today
let's take this out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones.</p>

[SPEAKER] Well here we are with a bill that says regulatory reform and
this is regulatory enhancement. We're creating more regulations on
individuals. And this is not only here, but if you turn to page 35
you've got behavioral analyst licensuers doing the same thing for a
behavioral analysts, whatever that is. But we established a board or
study commission to something in the interim to look at these people
that wanted to have a license. And I'm not aware that any of these came
through that committee with a positive report. I just think that it's
unfair for us to start picking and choosing and loading up a bill in the
guides of regulatory reform when it's actually increasing the regulatory
burden on people trying to do business in this state. This is the type
of thing that might be a good idea, but today is not the day and this is
not bill to do it. And I hope that we'll support that amendment.
[SPEAKER] Representative Hall. I knew we'd shut it down eventually
anyway.
[SPEAKER] You did a good job Representative Lewis. Thank you Mr.
Chairman and as we look at this question of regulatory capture which is
an interesting concept. But again, I don't think it really applies here.
This is a question of protecting folks and when we have regulations that
protect people certainly they if they get out of hand, we always as a
legislature have the opportunity to come back and change them, just like
we're trying to change things now. This idea that this should not stay
in the bill, it should stay in the bill. We regulate this fashion all
the time. We have things in the budget bill that are certainly policy
changes galore. So that question of whether or not we should be able to
change it, we should leave it in the bill until we have some discussion
that says it should not be. It is getting vetted pretty well this
morning. And so I would ask that you vote against the amendment. And Mr.
Chairman I call for the Ayes and Nos.
[SPEAKER] Yes, by all means. And I've been here 16 years and policy
decisions have been in the budget since time immemorial. It just didn't
happen lately. Representative Hagar.
[SPEAKER] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This bill has been vetted as
Representative Starnes said, it's been through two committees. It didn't
come out of a study committee. What they're trying to do is put a bill
that wouldn't pass into reg reform, basically is what's trying to happen
here. We've looked at this three times now and it's time to put this to
bed. It is an incumbent protection program as Representative Brawley was
talking about. We've said this time and time again. It protects the
people that are in the business and does give a barrier to entry for
folks that want to be in the business. I'm for the free market. I'm for
young folks getting into the business they want to get into with the
least barriers as possible. There's rules and laws out there to take
care of fraudulent issues. All you're doing is adding on top of them.
It's not needed. It's irrelevant and it's beat three times so please
vote for the amendment.
[SPEAKER] Representative Jordan and Lewis.
[SPEAKER] Thank you Mr. Chairman. When I look at issues such as
regulation and licensing, like Representative Hall says we look at
protection of the citizens. And it seems to me in this situation to use
common sense. The most problems that I think our citizens would be with
small fly by night issues and this completely exempts anything under
25,000. So I think it needs a better discussion and probably shouldn't
be in this bill and actually needs to be looked at further. There seems
to be a lot of problems with it. I would suggest we vote for this
amendment.
[SPEAKER] Thank you. Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I know time is getting short and I
appreciate your indulgence. Could I ask Representative Brawley of
Iredell, a follow up to his remarks.
[SPEAKER] Representative Brawley do you yield? He yields.
[SPEAKER] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Representative Brawley.
Would you speak again just so I can understand it. If a landscape job,
for instance may be mowing, I don't know, rest stops let's say were to
exceed a certain dollar amount, $30,000 or something like that. You
actually have to have a general contractor's</p>

<p id="35:00">
Fact there's license to bid on those.  Did I understand that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is what I was told this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister chairman, may I ask staff if that is indeed the
case?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Karen Cochran-Brown
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chair. The general contractors
licensing statute provides that anyone engaging in the general
definition of contracting, that does projects that exceed $30,000, has
to have a general contracting license. We have heard from members of the
landscape contract and registration board that landscape contractors who
engage in projects in the landscaping project, if they have any
hardscape in the landscaping project, have been required to have a
general contractor's license in order to do that work. So that's
basically that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chair, may I ask Miss Cochran-Brown an
additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chairman. Thank you Miss
Cochran-Brown. Just to be clear, this would apply to both private
contracts and also state contracts, so would it be fair to say that if
it is indeed a landscape contract, like I said, like mowing a rest stop,
providing landscape at a rest stop, that the total cost exceeded
$30,000, that the cost of or the cost to the contractor of hiring the
general contractor, would in fact increase the cost to the state or
increase the cost to the private ?? who was trying to hire these folks?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not completely sure that I understand the question Mr.
Lewis, but I will say that this provision includes specific exemptions
for certain state contracts including DOT and other states, so they are
exempted from the licensing requirement, and I believe there may be a
similar, not completely sure about this, but I believe there may be a
similar exemption in the general contractors licensing app.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chairman, I won't labor the point. I don't
know, to be totally candid, if this belongs to this bill or not.  I do
think, at some point, we do need to address the fact that if indeed it
is a landscape oriented project, that the requirement to have a general
contractor, which I forget which speaker made that point, who generally
builds homes or commercial structures or what-not, to pay them just to
have their name on the job seems to add cause.  It doesn't seem to be a
very efficient use nor does it seem to provide any additional protection
to the public.  I think under this proposal for the amendment that may
be addressed for change. So, I'm sorry for taking us down this path, but
I do think this is important to point out that it seems to me like this
is overkill to require a general contractor, if you're talking about a
very large landscaping project.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee
and I don’t mean any disrespect for the bill sponsor, he’s being a great
practitioner, a great legislator, doing what he’s directed to do but I
did not know I could go to you with any subject under the sun that I
wanted passed into law, the law of this state and had it inserted into a
bill called regulatory reform. Mr. Chairman, I don’t know that we’ve
ever done this to this extent and just because something’s happened
before doesn’t mean at some point you have to dig in and not be pushed
any further because I think these things accelerate over time and I
don’t wanna get in trouble but I’m prepared to. We just debated for
about 25 minutes one portion of this bill and what about all the other
portions? I mean, what kind of legislating is this and I’m for a lot of
these, probably most of them. But these all should, I wonder if I should
make a motion to separate all of these into separate bills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It won’t be recognized sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But I’m serious, this is not good legislating to put a
hodgepodge of totally unrelated provisions onto one bill, call it
something it’s not and run it through with a straight face. Increasing
the penalties for graffiti, I can go through hearing name of these
things and I don’t wanna vote for this and what’s it’s used for is to
get something that would not pass, we’re trying to get them to pass and
we’re in essence, bypassing the entire legislative process for certain
provisions if we do this and I just don’t think it’s a good idea and I’m
not gonna go along with it. I’m gonna vote no. Members, at some point
you’ve gotta turn around and make a stand or it’s gonna get worse and
worse as time goes by and I’m gonna make my stand right here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You. Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chairman. First I would just like to
ask staff on the section 2,3 – clarify outdoor advertising amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What page is that, Representative Carney?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Page 24 and it goes to the top of page 25.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you will repeat the question, Miss Becky?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I guess what I’m asking, I’ll just ask specific
question rather than just go over that ?? sake of time. On page 25, on
the top of line 1, it’s a carryover from the other page. I would like
for them to explain to me what the addition of or any non-conforming
sign means?</p>

<p id="45:00">
Miss Churchill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, I believe what
is going on is within the regulatory scheme for outdoor advertising,
there are signs that are non-conforming, that are still in place because
they have been grandfathered. So they are still allowed to be maintained
and you have to get the permit to maintain it but it’s not technically
one that conforms with the placement of new signs because it was
pre-existing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, I would like to send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney is recognized to send forth her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment is to amend the bill on page 24, line 26
through page 25, line 4 by deleting those lines. And I’m going back to
the previous comments, and yes, I know we’ve had policy on these bills -
I’ve been here 12 years. But this is one, if you look at line 40 on page
24, there’s a whole new section in there that is in essence saying to
the industry, you get to decide what you’re going to cut at just carte
blanche. And to grandfather in all of these, to me, the permanent
grandfathering of all billboards statewide is not the way for us to go-
to just allow an industry to control. We all know that a few years back,
we had a bill up here that really, in essence, some voted for it
thinking that we were protecting our cities and protecting their
billboards. And, in essence, when it came back to us, in it, there was a
change and it has just about stripped our cities from any say and our
local governments from any say in the regulating of these billboards. So
I would ask for the removal of this and your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion or debate? Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question
for the amendment sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, you
said there was a new section that gave carte blanche. Which section was
that, please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it was line 40 on 24. And it’s
also the addition of any non-conforming sign. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized to speak on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It looks to me like it says specifically
acceleration or deceleration ramps, so I don’t think it is a carte
blanche issue. That’s the way I read it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I
respond? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am, I’m sorry. Proceed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well, it says “and” if you look, it says “and along” it’s the
first part that the Department of Transportation shall issue a selective
vegetation removal permit upon request of the owner of outdoor
advertising or the owner’s agent for the cutting, thinning, pruning or
removal of vegetation outside of the cut or removal zone defined in
General Statute 136 and the acceleration. It’s the first part that is
wide open. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate.
Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I guess it’s a question
for staff. So, would staff respond – Miss Churchill? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m just trying to get a conclusion as to
what this amendment – what the language is before the Carney amendment.
Is it saying that any outdoor advertiser who feels that the outdoor
advertising is being not seen clearly because of trees, can with the
permit, have those trees cut down? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Within certain limitations, 136-133.1 already sets some limits
on the geographic area and how much can be cut so that still would
remain in place. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, so it can be, if I’m the owner
and under the circumstances set in the language, if I feel the trees
block the view of my outdoor advertising, I can have those trees cut
down? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion.
Representative Bill Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can I ask a follow up of
staff? The trees that we are talking about cutting, are these on private
property or these in the public right of way?</p>

Mr. Chair… [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to be honest, Representative
Brawley; I don’t know. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Well I’m going to support the amendment for
this simple reason: this is not regulatory reform; this is… and I have
always been very supportive of the outdoor advertizing agency, and I’d
like the billboards to be able to have the trees cut down in front of
them so that you can see them, but here again, it’s just an example of
taking a bill that was supposed to be regulatory reform and we’re
loading it up with a policy issue because it couldn’t get out of a
committee somewhere. This is not the place to be putting this type of
legislation. This ought to be a bill somewhere else, so I’m going to
support the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate?
Representative Carney moves for the adoption of her amendment. All in
favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion carried. Amendment is
adopted. At ease for a moment. Representative Stam, you’re recognized to
send forth your amendment. Copies are being passed out. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would you like me to go ahead and be explaining it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This addresses the graffiti
provision; that’s a new criminal statute with a new felony. It really
should be in a judiciary committee, not regulatory reform, and I just
move to take it out just to make the passage of the bill easier. I’m
actually for this bill, Representative Murry, and I just think we ought
to take as much of the graffiti out of it as possible. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
This ain’t my dog. I’m just walking it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s get the
leash back on it. Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none,
Representative Stam moves for the adoption of his amendment. All in
favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed.
Motion carried. There goes the kitchen sink. Further discussion or
debate from the committee? [SPEAKER CHANGES] On what? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the bill. Representative Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have to come
down with Representative Blust. As I look at this bill, I see at least
two things that I have voted against as separate bills in the past. I
think they both actually passed the House, by the way, but I just, in
order to be consistent with where I’ve been before, I’m going to have to
vote against this just because it contains those two things. Again, if
we could decouple this thing, vote on one at a time… This kind of
reminds me of when I was a freshman and the Senate passed us back
something that was so heinous that in the finance committee,
Representative Starnes actually made the to me unheard of motion of
giving the bill an unfavorable report after we had failed to give it a
favorable report. We did, and then it came back over cobbled with about
eight other things we wanted from the Senate and we wound up passing it,
and I just… I don’t know. I didn’t come here to do things that way, so
even though I like probably a majority of what’s in here, I’m going to
have to vote against the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Who am I talking to? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, excuse me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There really are a lot
of good regulatory reform things in here, so I would ask if
Representative Collins would tell us which ones that he voted against
and doesn’t think should be here so that perhaps I could prepare an
amendment for him. You can think about that, Jeff. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, think about that. We’ll come back to you. Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I just wanted to ask
Senator Walters – I mean Representative Murry – if the high-intensity
discharge part is still in this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Section
1.1. If you want to look at the… [SPEAKER CHANGES] What page is that,
Representative Murry? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s the first page. Part one.
The original bill as filed by Representative Walters dealt with
aftermarket head lamps, and so that is the first section of the bill. It
deals with… it deals additionally – we actually expanded that to
aftermarket airbags as well, and so we can address if there’s any major
changes between Senator Walters original bill as filed, but it still
deals with the regulatory issue of aftermarket head lamps and transfer
of automobiles when you have added aftermarket head lamps and
aftermarket airbags for public safety, so that is a regulatory provision
in the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No
follow-up, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.</p>

<p id="55:00">
I'd like to just say a few good things about the bill. That would be
pleasant. A pleasant change, please. For example, just taking your
summary here is rather than going through the bill itself. 2.1, property
owners have had rights to have density credits for years, but they're
never told about it at the time that the government exacts land from
them. This requires the government to actually tell them about that.
Section 2.2c, all the problems people have had with the highway corridor
map problem, people in Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Charlotte, where land
is tied up for decades. This is a simple change going from 3 years to 1
years that the government would have to decide whether to proceed if a
property owner wanted to develop the property. Just something very, very
reasonable that needs to be done. 2.7 is extremely important. Protest
petitions are about as anti-democratic a thing as I can think of.
Basically what it says to city councils is forget majority rule. If one
person files a valid protest petition, they may only be about 5% of the
adjoining owners, then it makes it almost impossible to make a
legislative change to the zoning because you have these super-majority
requirements. That has actually passed the House last year, and we're
told that this time that the Senate will actually agree with it. I don't
know why they didn't pass it last year, but they didn't, but I'm told
that they probably will this time. I could just go on and on. Well,
let's take a couple of other things. Mug shots as public records is in
there. Autism health insurance that we voted for before that the Senate
doesn't seem to be able to take up as a stand alone item. A vast
majority of the House passed the Youth Skin Cancer Protection Act,
that's regulatory reform and actually the people opposed to it before,
the Suntanning Association, they've even dropped their opposition to it.
This gives the Senate another chance to do the right thing. So, there's
a little bit of additional ethics revisions in there for local boards.
So overall it's good, and I'd be very interested cause we still have
some more time, if there's some stuff that you voted against
Representative Collins that could come out, let's do that rather than
kill what's overall a very good bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to build on
what Representative Stam said. You know, y'all, I don't know how often
there's any bill, even if it's on a single topic, that we like and agree
with every provision of, and every year we've done basic amends bills,
corrections bills and such, and yes, I think some of these are bigger
and some of them probably needed to come out, but the idea that you can
only vote for a bill that you agree 100% with would mean most of us
would not vote for any budget that's ever been presented regardless of
which party presented it. So I would re-endorse what Representative Stam
said and say if you like most of it and you're not strongly
principitally opposed to it, I'd go ahead and vote for it. If you've got
strong principial objections to it, that's another matter. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Lewis moves to adopt the PCS for Senate Bill 493

We have two occupancy tax bills that should not take much time. House
bill 1044, Representative ??Louis. Where's my gavel. We're not adjourned
yet. You just thought we were.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. House bill 1044 makes only
conforming changes to how the ?? township tourism board is appointed.
There's no opposition, I have supporting resolutions from the board, the
Dunn chamber of commerce, and the city council of Dunn. I would ask for
your support, and Mr. Chairman if I could be recognized for a motion.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]I move that house bill 1044 be given a favorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Members of the committee have heard the motion on the
floor, any further discussion or debate? If not all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye!
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed, motion carried. At this point we'll have
house bill 1244, Wilson County Occupancy Tax. Representative Wilson.
Representative Martin, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair, thank you members of the
committee. I did send out an email last night to all the members of the
committee with a lot of details on this if there's any questions. I do
have some hand-outs if you did not get to look at your emails. This
passed through the occupancy tax subcommittee with a favorable report,
unanimous, it has bipartisan unanimous support for the ?? county
commissioners. I would move for a motion, or take any questions that you
have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative ??Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I was going to make the motion that she just did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Members of the committee you've heard the motion from

discussion or debate. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Representative Martin your
not a member of finance. Representative ??Samuelson moves for the
adoption of house bill 1244. Sold! Thank you. Any further discussion or
debate? If not all in favor say aye. All opposed, motion carried. House
bill 1114, Elk Park, deed transfer, Representative Dobson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. This
is a local bill for the town of Elk Park in Avery County. Basically what
it states is that the register-er of deeds won't record a deed for
property in the town, unless the taxes have been paid on that property.
There's already a law on the books for many of the local towns in Avery
County, and I would just add Elk Park to the list. I'd appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Ok. Once, once a session for the last ten years I make
my little speech on this, and that is if Representative Dobson, i'll
vote for his bill if he promises never to vote for one like this for
??Wake County. Even if i'm dead, or gone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We can't make promises like that. And the reason, one
hand of the assembly can't bind the hands of the next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No, i'm not asking the assembly. I'm saying, and if,
Dobson he'll be here much longer than I will, and I don't want this for
??Wake County. The reason is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He won't run it for ??Wake County, and I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The reason is...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Cause although the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'd like to keep the floor for a second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Although a lot of these tax collectors ask for these
things, and this really is for everybody else who maybe asked for this.
They think they're collecting more money because of this, but they're
not. The dynamics of the real property business, is that one of the ways
you collect taxes is to get multiple heirs to go ahead and put land into
one person's name, and then you get actually taxes paid. So, i'm gonna
vote for it, i'll even make the motion for a favorable report, just
never vote for it for ??Wake please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you for the motion, Representative ??Samuelson?
Oh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He just made the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all favor
of the motion, regarding, excuse me, house bill 1114 say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye!
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed, motion carried. Thank you, thank you
Representative Dobson. And last, but not least, house bill 1033,
authorized fee for repairs of the damn of Richmond. Representative
Goodman. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is a bill we, in Richmond
county there's a damn on a lake that creates some flood control. Plus
there's about a hundred homes around this lake. The homeowner's don't
have the money to repair the damn. The county wants to form a special
tax district, repair the damn, and impose a special tax district to get
the money back. Everybody's in favor, there's no opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative ??Lueke. You've heard the motion on the
floor, any further discussion, or debate. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye!
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed, motion carried. Representative Goodman,
are you prepared for housebill.</p>
