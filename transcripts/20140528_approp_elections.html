The House Committee on Elections, please come to order. The chair thanks
all the members for their attendance and apologizes for the slightly
tardy start to the day’s meeting. Our Sergeant-At-Arms today include
Young Bay, Patrick Mason, Barry Moore and Warren Hawkins. We appreciate
you for all of your hard work. We are also pleased to have several pages
with us today I think. Yes, we do. We have Marshall Barnes from Pender
County, Clarissa Bryson from Haywood County, Antoinette Dier from Wake
County… the Chair apologized in advance. Adogme Evumpum? Close maybe?
The chair hopes so. If not, apologies. And Zachary Hocup from Johnston
County. The Chair appreciates all of your work in being here today. At
this time we’re going to begin with House Bill 11-58. Representative
Blackwell… Do we have PCS on this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members, the Chair is informed there is a proposed committee
substitute on this bill. Representative Dixon moves the proposed
committee substitute to House Bill 11-58 be before us, and is there any
objection? Seeing none, so ordered, and Representative Blackwell, you
have the floor to explain the bill, Sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. This is a bill that was introduced by me, and a companion
bill in the Senate by Representative Daniel, in response to the
unanimous request of the Morganton City Council to make a couple of
changes in the city charter relating to elections, and I have
confirmation from the city attorney Mr. Vinay this morning that they
have reviewed the PCS and agree that it is in agreement with what the
city council unanimously requested. In short, I would say that there are
two primary changes that this focuses on. One is that historically,
Morganton has had an election in which if you didn’t get a majority of
the votes, there would have to be a runoff. So they had an election
normally in October, and then if nobody got a majority, they would have
a runoff in November. They have over the years decided that they would
like to change that to more or less do it the way most other
municipalities and bodies now do it, and that is have election by
plurality. That would allow them to have their election in November, it
would save the city money, it would help avoid confusion with voters who
didn’t understand why they were voting twice, maybe, in October. So
that’s the first thing, and then the second thing is Morganton is a
little bit unique, but not totally so, in that its charter provides for
recall of city officials, and we are slightly changing the recall
provisions. Before the city of Morganton had its own Board of Elections,
and this statute refers to filing the position for recall with the old
Morganton Board. Instead this is being changed to more or less accord
with a recall provision that involves the Burke County Board of
Education, and the provision for recall would be filed with the county
Board of Elections instead, and there is other language in there
clarifying that in filing a recall provision, that you would state some
ground, you file your affidavit with the county Board of Elections, and
that the petitioner would then receive blanks to take to registered
voters to get the requisite number of signatures, and that they would
need to complete that process within 30 days so that it wouldn’t drag on
over months as somebody continued to go around the community trying to
get signatures on a recall petition. If there are any questions, I’ll be
glad to try and answer them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The Gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Blackwell. I was just going to ask, are you aware of any
significant opposition to the bill – to the local bill? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]</p>

Mr. Chair I’d be happy to make a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Jones has moved that the proposed
committee substitute for house bill 58 and an unfavorable report to the
original bill. Is there further discussion or debate on the proposed
committee substitute for house bill 1158. Seeing none those who favor
the motion by Representative Jones to give the proposed committee
substitute for house bill 1158 a favorable report will signify by saying
aye. Those opposed will say no. In the opinion of the chair the ayes
have it and the motion carries thank you Representative. At this time
the Chair is going to yield the chair to Co-chairman Moore and assist
with the presentation of the next bill, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members you have before you house bill 1108. The Chair
will without objection entertain the PCS. Is there objection? Hearing
none, the PCS is before the committee. Representatives Lewis and ?? I
believe this is your bill. Both of you gentlemen are recognized to
explain the proposed committee substitute. Members you should have
copies at your desk.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. Members, the first part of this
bill, some of you may remember down in Duplin County in the last session
we changed our districts on the board of education and the ??? from six
to five. There was no opposition to that change from anybody. We have
implemented that change; however, at one point a sitting county
commissioner resigned which required the necessity to appoint a person
in his place. That calls some confusion; however, the bill as originally
passed has been implemented exactly like it was proposed and exactly
like it is. This is strictly a technical change to identify particular
individuals in particular districts as to when their reelection is to
take place. There is no opposition to it, Ms. Carol McCraw has worked
intensely with the board of education and county commissioner’s
attorneys to draft this bill. I know of no opposition to it. I would
appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Lewis do you want to the ??? provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir Mr. Chairman, thank you. Members of the
committee I’ll be addressing sections five through the end of the bill.
Section five adds Harnett County to the list of counties that specify
that should a vacancy occur on the county board of commissioners or the
county school board that the political party from which the individual
who caused the vacancy to occur, the executive committee of that party
would be the one who recommends the replacement to fill that seat. That
is the way it’s done in many counties and there’s been some question
reason in our county about what would occur and so this should add some
clarity to that. Section six deals with only the county managers or the
superintendents of the counties and what it says is that the board of
commissioners or the school board can fill these two vacancies during
these seven months before the reconstitution of the board and to explain
to you what I mean by that, every December the board of commissioners
and the school board reconstitutes itself in my county. I know in some
of yours that occurs in May, but in ours it occurs in December. That’s
when the elect the new chairman and whatnot. What this says is if the
old board, if you will, for the last seven months that it’s in office if
it needs to..</p>

Position that it would need to be by unanimous vote of the board, and
what is the purpose of this is to keep an old board, if you will, from
binding a new board with these two very important county hirings. It
does not affect any other position within the counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. ?? the chair sees you here. Does the State Board of Elections have
any interest in this bill or are you just here to visit with us today?
Well, we’re glad to have you. Good to have you here. Representative
Jones, for what purpose does the gentleman seek recognition?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Information at the appropriate time, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, Representative Michaux, did you have a question, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I’ve got a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Member from Durham is recognized to submit a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For Mr. Lewis. Representative Lewis, I noticed that the PCS would
require the appointing authority to be bound by the party
recommendation. I’m a little confused. Is the person to be replaced
going to be replaced by the party of the person that’s being replaced.
Is that what you’re saying now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s not clear. It says it could be that the opposite party may make a
recommendation also and that recommendation has, but if that’s not the
intent of it then I can live with that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I could respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman may want to address that to staff. What my reply would be,
Representative, is this is existing language, old language, and I am
merely asking to add my ?? to this list. As always, you may be correct,
there may be some cleanup language that should be required on old
statutes, but I don’t think it actually affects the intent of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, may I follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized for follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess the follow-up is, if the party of the person who’s replacing
that person, that recommendation should be, I think if that’s not clear.
That’s why I raised the question Mr. Lewis, because to me it really
wasn’t clear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If both gentlemen, Mr. ?? has his hand up, maybe this is a question he
can deal from staff if that would please the gentleman from Durham. Mr.
??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What set out in the bill was just a list of counties. The statute
underlying it, subsection A, I think in both cases, says that, if the
person was elected as the nominee of a political party, it’s the County
Executive Committee of that party that makes that nomination. The other
party has no role in it. If the person was like a non-affiliated
commissioner, which there are a few around the state, then this process
doesn’t apply to them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Buncombe, Representative Fisher,
seek recognition?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To propound a question, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Member is recognized for that purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I’m wondering, how did this come about in the first place?
Did you have a request from your county commissioners? From your county
board of elections? From your local—how did this come about? Was this a
request locally and, if so, does everybody agree that this should
happen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative, I appreciate the inquiry and, again, I’ll speak
only to the section of the bill that deals with my county. This is
language that I have proposed. There was no request from either of the
county boards. It’s been an ongoing conversation for some time and it’s
my hope that, to clarify where the appointing of authority comes from to
fill the seats, that this will end the conversation. Just so you know,
this is prospective language, of course, and there are currently no
vacancies on either one of the boards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative
Speciale, seek recognition?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m a little confused here. How does this affect, I see Beaufort County
on here, what of this applies to Beaufort County, because I’m really
still confused about the whole bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman and Representative, where you see the words Beaufort
County, which I know is on page two, line</p>

seventeen and perhaps elsewhere in the bill. That's just because in
Beaufort County this is already the practice. If there is a vacancy on
your board then you're, then the Beaufort County executive code ?? sends
forth the name to fill that spot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions for members of the Committee. Further discussion or
debate? If not, the Chair will accept a motion from Representative Jones
for a favorable report to the PCS and favor to the original, is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is accepted. All those in favor of the motion please signify
by saying Aye. Those opposed No. The Aye's have it, the motion is
adopted. Members, it appears that concludes our business. Is there any
further business before the committee? If not, we stand adjourned.</p>
