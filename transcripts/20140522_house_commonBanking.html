Testing. One, two, three, testing. One, two, three, testing. One, two,
three. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Our bill sponsor is here, so I’m going to call
our first, and ya’ll, this might be our only, banking meeting. I think
we might have… I think I’ve heard there might be one more bill coming
our way, but we’ll see. For our Sergeant-At-Arms, we’ve got Charles
Goodwin. Godwin. Excuse me, sorry about that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s
okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] P.H. Powell, Patrick Mason and Billy Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pardon? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
don’t have the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They didn’t bring the bill?
Staff’s not here yet. Well then we can finish… For some reason staff’s
not here yet, so we’ll get them here. Let me go ahead and introduce our
pages. Do you want to just make quick copies? How many pages is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion to adjourn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does staff know
they’re supposed to be here now? Are they on their way? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Motion to adjourn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] While we’re here, let me
introduce our pages. Angelica Brice. Angelica, are you here? Way back
there. She’s sponsored by Tillis, from Gaston County. Toller Dixon.
Where’s Toller? There you are, Toller. New Hanover. Davis Junior? A Ted
Davis. I’ve never seen this Ted Davis Junior. Simone Weeks? Is Simone
here? Is it Simone? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes but Meeks. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Meeks. Ya’ll, I’m sorry. Wake County, from Representative Gill. Anthony
Sinopoli? Did I get that right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? That’s the one you
get right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] From Davie County with Representative
Tillis. You know what it is, while we’re waiting? Any of ya’ll wear
reading glasses? Have any of ya’ll started using the mono-vision contact
lens? It does – you have to get a little used to because one eye reads
better than the other, and so I have noticed, things like this, I
actually need to focus a little better, so I apologize for that. This is
actually a pretty simple bill. We’re going to get staff to make copies.
Would you all want to just wait for staff to make the copies? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, that’s what I thought. Then we
will recognize Representative Blust to go over and explain it, and if we
can get the copies in time, that’ll be great. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Madam Chairman and members of the committee. I‘m honored to be
before you today. Great group. This is a very simple bill. If you’ll
remember, a few years ago we had a comprehensive reform of the banking
laws. This bill is just bringing one minute provision that was changed
in the banking law; we are by this bill bringing the law into – the law
concerning savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit
unions – into conformity. And it’s very arcane when you pledge as
collateral on a loan a joint account. This law is going to be changed to
where all of those people on the joint account are liable, and it
survives the death of one of the people on the joint account. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So a joint account’s just going to be like a joint account.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, same as banking. The only way the other joint
tenants on the joint account – I don’t know if “tenants” is the right
word – can escape that surviving after death is if there is a riding
written agreement with the financial institution signed by all of the
joint tenants. This is the law now for banks, and this bill’s attempting
to bring the law for the other financial institutions into compliance
with the law for banks. It’s highly technical. It was given a thorough,
thorough discussion in the General Statutes Commission. Law professors
there can see every nuance and possible outcome, and it’s been
thoroughly vetted and I recommend it to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Before I
go to questions, part of the reason we are going ahead and doing it now
is because it’s got to go to Judiciary, and the only meeting of
Judiciary’s next Wednesday, which would be before our Thursday. Actually
I saw Representative Jeter first, then Hardister, then Carney. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For a question, Madam Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Blust, just to confirm, on the original loan on
the joint account holder, would both people have to signature? In other
words, if I had a joint account with my wife…</p>

<p id="05:00">
Let’s say my wife happened to sign something and not tell me, can I be
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, and that’s an important point. One joint tenant
can pledge it as collateral, and that binds the other joint tenant, so
be warned if you have a joint bank account, one tenant can make that as
collateral for a loan to the one joint tenant. And if that’s wrong Ms.
Whatley, please chime in, but I believe… I think that’s right, and
that’s one reason joint accounts can be tricky. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think ?? was next. John? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I
think this is a good bill and the time’s right. I’d like to make a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
ask my question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] In that case, is there a requirement in the bill that the other
joint tenant be notified if there is just one signed? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t believe that’s in the bill, but just like a partnership – just
like on a partnership – one partner can bind the others on debts that
the one partner runs up, and I think that’s there. I don’t think… I
don’t believe one of the people on the joint account has to notify the
others that they’re pledging in a security. I don’t think that’s
required. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think our banking rep back here was
agreeing with that, and Representative ?? also has ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I can make a comment on that, being in the mortgage industry, we’re
talking about collateralized loans, which are mortgages. Mortgages will
not close a loan if there’s a joint account being used unless all
account holders sign a statement that says “I know that this is being
used as collateral for the loan,” so I think that addresses the points
we were discussing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative B. Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to clarify, when
you talk about the other members of the joint account are liable, are
they liable beyond the contents of the joint account or only the
contents of the joint account? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sure it’s only the
contents of the joint account as far as it’s collateral. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Right, that’s correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Name and… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Lauren Langley with the Credit Union League. Yes, that’s
correct. It’s just only the collateral that was pledged. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And other questions? If not, Representative Hardister, you’re
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I
move for a favorable report on House Bill 1117 with a referral to
Judiciary Subcommittee A. Or is it B? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there a
second? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Second. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion’s been made
and seconded. All those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, nay. Ayes have it. The meeting is adjourned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And ya’ll, as you know,
this meeting will always happen at odd times, so we’ll work around it.</p>
