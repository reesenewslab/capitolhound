  <p>The House will come to order.
Senate Bill 515, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House committee substitute for Senate Bill 515. The bill has been
entitled an act to delay additional implementation of the Jordan Lake
rules and Jordan Lake session laws to provide for alternative
implementation of the protection of existing buffers rule. General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill for a period not to
exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I don&#39;t think it will take that long.
Yesterday, I think. Yeah, let me look at the clock. Yesterday, we had a
very healthy debate on this bill. We also had a good solid vote. I would
ask you to continue to support the bill. Thank you for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill for a period not to
exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t want to extend the debate at all. I just want to pose some
questions. The question is, does the state have an agreement with EPA
with relating to achieving targeted reductions of nitrogen and
phosphorus into Lake Jordan? The answer is yes and then my question
would be, has anyone determined whether delaying implementation of the
Jordan Lake rules may cause a stage of default on this agreement
relating to clean up of the lake? And the answer to that is also yes.
The EPA in a recent letter has raised concerns about the potential
impact of this very bill with respect to its compliance with this
agreement between the EPA and the state. The EPA notes that any
abandonment of efforts to achieve reductions from non-point source
discharges could make it necessary for the EPA to revisit the current
agreement and assign greater reductions to permit point source
dischargers. This would likely shift, or move, the cost of cleanup from
new development to upstream cities like Burlington and Greensboro. Just
the opposite of what&#39;s being sought here. I&#39;ve gone over at some
length, the Pilot Project funded through the Clean Water Management
Trust fund. I&#39;m very hopeful, Mr. Speaker and colleagues, that we
can get the state auditor to look at that one because it really does
appear to be a sole source contract. It is the type of thing that we
really shouldn&#39;t be about. I would tell you that this is not a good
bill. I would urge us not to concur in it for all the reasons that we
spoke about yesterday. Thank you,  Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the House committee
substitute of Senate Bill 515 on its third reading. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
All members please record. The clerk will let the machine record the
vote. 63 having voted in the affirmative and 41 in the negative, the
House committee substitute of Senate Bill has passed its third reading.
It will be returned to the Senate by special message.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a malfunction and wish to be recorded as voting no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen is recorded as voting no. Representative Warren, please
state your purpose.
Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to be recorded in voting aye on 182.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recorded as having voted aye on 182.

  <p>[silence]
Speaker: Members, we have two bills that… and with the possibility of
objection, a third reading, that we have to take a second reading on. We
are waiting for committee reports from rules. We are going to go ahead
and move forward. Representative Carney has chosen not to remove the
objection and to begin the debate on 380 at this time. So we will take
that up when we reconvene tonight. So, we are going to go back to…
[silence]
Speaker: House bill 92, the clerk will read. The clerk will read the
amendments. The clerk will read all four amendments.
Clerk: Senator Hart moves to mend the bill on page 12, lines 28-29, by
adding the following between the lines. Amendment 2, Senator Hart, moves
to amend the bill on page 33, lines 36 and 37. Senator Hart moves to
amend the bill on page 24, line 39 - page 25, line 22 by deleting the
lines. Senator Davis moves to amend the bill on page 32, lines 47 and
48, by inserting the following and deleting those lines.
Speaker: Representative Moore is recognized for a motion and to debate a
motion.
Representative: Mr. Speaker I first of all move that the house…that the
first motion be that the house do concur with the sitting committee’s
substitute for house bill 92, but I believe first of all we have to move
the adoption of the four amendments. So at this time Mr. Speaker, I
motion that we move the adoption of the four amendments and ask to be
recognized to explain that.
Speaker: Representative Shal, please state your purpose.
Representative: I don’t know what we are doing. I do not have anything
on dashboard at all.
Speaker: It may be that the clerk needs a little more time before the
amendments hit the dashboard Representative, we will wait. Members, this
particular bill is not time sensitive: we can’t take it up in the
morning. The chair is just trying to do the best we can to use this time
between now and midnight. Representative Jackson, please state your
purpose.
Representative: Mr. Chairman, Mr. Speaker, I have got a few questions on
behalf of Senator’s bill and I did not know if I could be asking those
questions while we are waiting…

  <p>Amendments. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, does the gentleman
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, I know I&#39;m pesky and like to
read things and I apologize. Section 42 of the deal, refers to a session
law. And it adds a line about electronic notice in lieu of traditional
publication and I was wondering if you could refer me to the statute
instead of the session law. I mean, what is we&#39;re changing. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That is a provision that deals with electronic notice in lieu
of the traditional means for Apex, Carey, Garner and Nightdale. That is
an existing law that is in place. I believe Representative Stam actually
requested that provision if the gentleman would like to direct the
question to Representative Stam if the Speaker would allow that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam the gentleman yields you may
respond to the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, this was requested by
the town of Carey because their bond counts or whatever didn&#39;t think
that the law was clear enough for them. Apex, Raleigh were okay but this
request of the town of Carey. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker may I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Representative Stam I represent
Nightdale and Garner. I just want to make sure we&#39;re not taking away
any ability they currently have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, it doesn&#39;t
add any towns, it doesn&#39;t subtract any towns, it just gives some
comfort to hyper-technical bond counts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker
another question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To whom does the member wish to
direct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t know who is offering each of
these, but it&#39;s section 36.7 which has to do with redistricting
communications. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the gentleman would speak up
Representative Jackson, I don&#39;t know if the others are having
difficulty. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It&#39;s section 36.7 it has to do with
redistricting communications. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can handle that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What
that provision simply does, is that codifies the holding out of the case
of Dixon vs. Rucho. That codifies what the court holding was. That&#39;s
it. And one thing, I know we just sort of jumped into questions. What I
want the House to understand is, the bulk of these changes are staff
driven. This is a technical amendment. The way the sections are done,
there&#39;s the purely technical. Then there&#39;s the, I guess what
you&#39;d say is technical plus. I&#39;m not aware of any major policy
type things that have occurred. This is a clean technical bill as far
as, from everything I&#39;ve seen. If I were writing the bill and able
to just put what I wanted to it&#39;d probably be a lot more stuff. But
this is more technical. The bill is before us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up Mister Speaker. The final question I have to Representative Moore. If
I could. And I just got an email so I&#39;m not sure, I haven&#39;t ??
bill. But I understand that we&#39;re changing as far as it goes to
mediators, about the authorized practice of law. It changes it makes it
so you don&#39;t have to be an attorney to write up a mediation
agreement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is a limited exception that is for
university employees to write up a mediation agreement only in that
context, ?? and it doesn&#39;t go beyond the scope of practiced law, or
anything else that is limited. Just in the universities. Again I believe
that was requested by, is that by staff? Office of state personnel of
the university system. I&#39;m aware of no opposition to that.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mister Speaker, if I could follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Do you know if the state
bar was consulted about this change? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That section, by
the way, if you want to see it in the section is section 38.5 of the
bill. I do not know whether or not the state bar was consulted, I&#39;ve
received nothing and I don&#39;t know if any of our staff have received
any objections from the state bar on this. I saw one of the lobbyists
for the bar earlier tonight talking and nobody said word one to me about
it so I know of no objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mister
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But if someone sent me a communication
saying that the state bar objected to this change you wouldn&#39;t
dispute that characterization would you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I think
if you said somebody sent it to you I&#39;d believe what you told me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? to
the amendment ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m thrilled to. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
The gentleman is thrilled. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, in
rules my concern still relies in the first word of mine. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]

  <p>Four.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Of which page?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
In your amendment. This is H nine two A R one dash one one zero D one B
one I&#39;m sorry.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Mister speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I can answer that question if I might. Representative Ford what that
does is that fixes an effective date on House bill seventy four that
passed today. That is purely technical.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
It&#39;s technic but my concern is we talked about it in rules...you
follow me mister speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
The gentlemen yields.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
We talked about this in rule and if that&#39;s a concern that&#39;s a
concern that when staff sent us one if House...it seems to me that it
should be when but we keep getting it from staff if a certain thing come
to us and it&#39;s a order and we must respond to it in the positive.
That&#39;s just my question it&#39;s just a question.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
If I can respond I think I understand and that is where we had our
English debate in &quot;Friend Rules&quot; and what the gentlemen is
saying is that the gentlemen feels like that if you just read it.
Instead of saying if House bill seventy four you should say when House
bill seventy four. And we almost made that change but our staff
cautioned us and said &quot;Wait a minute we&#39;ve always done it as
if&quot;. That&#39;s how we know to catch it. So as a result we leave it
as is. It&#39;s just how you want to word something. I think we&#39;d
all agree there&#39;s no substitute difference but the gentlemen from
Cumberland feels like it will flow better and probably it would, I guess
these are statuettes and not poetry I don&#39;t know.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
?? mister speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I yield.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
The gentlemen yields and ladies and gentlemen before the following
question Representative Malone ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I yield.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
The gentlemen will yield.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Malone the Chair understands that you wish to change your
vote from aye to no on the Jordan light bill. So ladies and gentlemen
for your information...and this is very important for you to hear...we
have probably three votes to take before midnight. Be sure to cast the
right vote. The Chair will not allow any vote changes as a courtesy to
the clerk because we&#39;re moving bills as quickly as we can to the
Senate. And to change the vote after a few minutes requires them to
withdraw the bill and that would be a lot of administrative work so the
Chair will not allow any vote changes after the vote is recorded for the
remainder of this evening. Representative Wilkins please state your
purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Inquiry of the Chair...??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Gentlemen ?? his inquiry.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
...as to procedure mister speaker. We will block vote the amendments is
that correct?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
That is correct.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
And could we get a bit of detail from Representative Moore as we move
into this.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yeah absolutely Representative Watkins we were trying to make use of the
time as the dashboard was updated. I believe now that the amendments are
on the dashboard. Is that correct madame cleric? So at this time I think
we can move back in I&#39;m just trying to use the time ?? and I
appreciate the members indulging. So at this time Representative Moore
is recognized to explain the amendments.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister speaker, let me start with amendment number one. Again
amendment number one fixed the effective date issue as to House bill
seventy four. That is the staff explanation has been provided on that. I
think this is amendment number two but what I&#39;m looking at is H
ninety two ASU fifty two B two members have a chance to see that one?
This one I&#39;m reading on is V two anyway what I&#39;m ?? moves to
amend the bill on page twenty four line line thirty nine through page
twenty five line twenty two by deleting those lines very simply this
removed the section on Meclink which had been handled in the budget
technical corrections again that&#39;s The other amendment which
unfortunately mister Stalin told me is longer was offered by Senator
Harts. This is...in the words of the state grand city councilman,
&quot;This is a hodge podge.&quot; And what these are...I can tell you
section eighteen.

  <p>.5 has to do with, for example it said, an entity, said a person or
entity. This had to do for the immunity from civil criminal liability as
a result of transmitting data related to those, to that section. The
next two are simply modifying effective dates. [inaudible background]
The next section there 30.5 is one I was involved with remember we
passed House bill 26 [tightened it all up] on a salvage yards about the
vehicle being stolen and reselling and not having all that and so forth.
This fixed a technical issue on that. [inaudible background] The next
section that deals on where it says page 19 line 42 about the hearing
aid specialist that was consensus language requested by all of the
stakeholders on that. And it goes all the way down to line 16 of the
next page. [inaudible background] Right, [inaudible background] this,
there was a section in the next section see there, that had to do with
rental units and metering. It simply removed that from the bill that was
a request of the bill sponsors. [inaudible background] The next whole
thing that has to do with appoint, with the appointments bill you’ll see
where it mentions all the names of parties appointed, as your technical
corrections to the appointments bill that’s already passed. [inaudible
background] [unintelligible] One of our staff found some problems if you
look at section 2.2 with the effective dates for the State Personnel act
again but just had to be modified to reflect the correct days. I think
those are pretty self explanatory, if you look at those. [inaudible
background] The remaining section was a request of Senator McKissick of
Durham, to clean up language related to speech pathologist. It was all
clean up language and I believe that entire rest of the bill through the
final through page, all the way through page 6 of it, was what that
amendment covered. [inaudible] The next, the next amendment that was
offered by Senator Davis which says section, starts off of section 44.5,
was, deals with an issue, there was a bill that Representative Brown had
passed that dealt with I think a school board and it was technical, and
it appears, I guess that would be a bipartisan thing there, if the
members want, if the speaker wants Representative Brown to speak to it,
if the members felt they have questions that had to do with that school
board and would be, would appear to be technical in nature. Those are
the amendments that Mr. Speaker of the House wants to vote on the
amendments and then we can get into the weeds on the rest of the bill.
[speaker change] Are there members wishing to ask questions on the
amendments? Representative Harrison. [speaker change] Thank you. Mr.
Speaker, Representative Moore, I just could not, follow you on where the
metering language is, which section that is that you referenced. The
change to metering. [speaker change] It’s amendment H92ASU50 v14 at the
top. And if you look at, there there&#39;s no change to the statute, it
removed the language from the technical correction, that if you look
it’s on line, look, look on the lines, it’s page 2 of 6. Lines 22 to 23.
You’ll see it just deleted those lines. [speaker change] Thank you.
[speaker change] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[speaker change] To see if Representative Moore would yield for a
question. [speaker change] The gentlemen yields. [speaker change] Thank
you. Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative. I just wanted to double
check it’s, trying to read it fast, but the effective date changes
Representative, can you tell us just which bills the effective date is
changing? [speaker change] which section there were several of them
?[speaker change] Well it’s in [Heartzle] amendment the long [Heartzle]
amendment you said there couple sections are changing effective dates of
bills. I’m just because I can’t get [speaker change] I believe that was
the Personnel act if I’m not mistaken section 2.2 page 3 of 6. [speaker
change] Ok one follow up question Mr. Speaker [speaker change] The
gentleman yields. [speaker change] Thank you and Representative Moore is
that the only bill where the effective dates being changed? [speaker
change] there’s one, there’s a couple in the appointments bill in that
same

right thank you.[SPEAKER CHANGES] If the gentlemen sees one please point
it out. But we don&#39;t see anything.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further debate on the amendments. If not, the
question before the House is the motion to concur ?? the senate
amendments for the senate committee substitute of House bill 92 all in
favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will let the machine record the vote. 106 have voted in the
affirmative, one in the negative. The motion passes. We&#39;re back on

please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question of representative
Moore.[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen yields.[SPEAKER CHANGES] I
yield.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. On section 41, page 32, there is a
change in rental units inspections. I wondered if you could give a
little bit of background on that because I know we changed rental unit
inspections both last session and earlier this year.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. There was a bill that passed.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Moore, we have two other bills that we need to take up. I do believe the
members have legitimate questions they&#39;d like to ask. What the chair
would like to do is advise the gentleman to maybe go over, meet with
Representative Glazier and Representative Harrison to answer the
questions to maybe answer the questions.[SPEAKER CHANGES] We can do one
better than that. We have a summary Mister Speaker. And we will make
that available, the bullet points that staff did. Welcome to look at
that, and this ?? to be voted on tonight.[SPEAKER CHANGES] If we have
time we&#39;ll do it tonight otherwise we&#39;ll carry it over but
we&#39;ll provide you adequate time and displace the bill.
Representative Moore is recognized ?? committee report, the clerk will

Carolina statute or provision of North Carolina constitution. The
general assembly of North Carolina unites.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr, the chair understands you&#39;re carrying this
bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;d be correct.[SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mister Speaker. Just one moment please. Mister Speaker, this is a bill
that is near identical that was passed earlier today by representative
Collins. It was included in his bill, there were several changes made to
it that I know were changes requested by some of the attorneys in the
rules committee. Perhaps Representative Stam or Representative Daughtry
would like to speak to the changes they made. Otherwise it&#39;s
identical and the debate&#39;s basically the same as we had today with
exception of those few changes, so perhaps one of them would like to
address those changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam is
recognized to debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is this 473? I can&#39;t
see. Yes. Yes Mister Speaker. It has three provisions. The first two,
were amendments that were adopted in the rules committee yesterday, but
because they come over in a different bill, we couldn&#39;t for
concurrence amend them. The first one deals with a health care provider
can only charge the actual cost to the provider if they do a procedure
before getting informed consent. The second provision, representative
Daughtry he&#39;ll explain that. The third gives standing to the Speaker
of the House, President ??, as agents of the general assembly, if they
act jointly, to intervene in litigation to defend the constitutionality
of our statutes.

  <p>And set out a procedure, because under rule 24 of the rules of civil
procedure, which together with the commentary and cases is about 10
pages in this book, that procedure is set out. This is a protection for
the assembly, and I recommend the bill to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
see if Representative Stam would yield for a question please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam, I’m going to ask a question, possibly
several, on section 3 I believe. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’m trying to again read it really fast. But my first question
is, is that section designed to take away the authority of the Attorney
General to defend or to decide whether to defend the state, and giving
it to the speaker and the president pro tempore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
The Attorney General retains all the authority to be a party in
litigation by the state. Intervention is an additional party, but no
taking away of any authority of the Attorney General. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second follow up, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Representative and Mr. Speaker. Under intervention,
the rule of intervention is under as you suggested the rules of civil
procedure. Is this section designed to trump the North Carolina rules of
civil procedure? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, as I said in my statement the
procedure by which this would take place would be under rule 24.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Last question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. And so a
court in your mind, under section 3, reserves the right to deny
intervention under rule 24 if the court determines that intervention is
not appropriate. Would that be correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there’s
two interventions under rule 24. Intervention as of right, and
permissive intervention. So under subsection B, permissive intervention,
it would be discretionary with the court. Under subsection A, in certain
cases it would be a matter of right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The last
question. I apologize, that leads to one more. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Under intervention
as a matter of right, is your claim that section 3 creates any specific
intervention as a matter of right independent of the rule and its
guidelines? [SPEAKER CHANGES] [PAUSE] I don’t think so, but I have to
think through that. In other words, the procedure would be under rule
24, and its guidelines. It just states that these two gentlemen, if they
act together, are agents of the state so if the state has a right to
intervene, then under rule 24A, they would have a right to intervene.
Doesn’t mean they replace any other party like the Attorney General, the
Governor or some agency. But they have a right to be a party. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much.
I appreciate Representative Stam and I’m going to try to repeat what I
understand section 3 to be and hope that it’s clarified before it
finally becomes law. That it is not the intent nor the language to
replace the Attorney General’s right to defend the state, but the
Attorney General is still the primary defender of the state, but the
speaker and president pro tempore though were given authority to
intervene on behalf of the General Assembly, but only to the extent that
it meets rule 24 standards where the court determines either
permissively they should be allowed to intervene, or where it determines
that they have otherwise qualified as an intervener as of right. And I
guess maybe Mr. Speaker, my best way to explain that would be to ask
that as a final question of Representative Stam, if he concurs. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree that you have correctly stated it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the House is
the passage of House Committee Substitute number 2 for Senate Bill 473
on its second reading. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote. 70 having voted in the affirmative and 38 in the
negative, the House Committee Substitute number 2 to Senate Bill 473 has
passed its second reading and without objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised, the bill will
remain on the calendar. Senate Bill 483, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] House Committee Substitute number 2 for Senate Bill 483, a bill
to be entitled an act to streamline a process of leasing space of state
agencies under very limited circumstances and to amend the setoff debt
collection act. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 483
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh yes. The first sections of this bill is one that streamlines the
leasing for the Western Crime Lab because, apparently, it&#39;s on a
month to month right now. That&#39;s really all I know about it. Section
2 is new today and I would ask the Speaker to recognize Representative
Brian Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brown is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members, this addition that we added was
something that I spoke about on the floor earlier today in regards to
House Bill 834. In an environment where we continue to ask our
University systems to be more efficient, find cost saving measures,
working in an environment where they become more creative in generating
revenue to remain solvent and provide their mission of charity care,
essentially. This is a very important provision to remain in effect that
is currently statute, that helps them do just that - remain solvent and
continue to carry out their mission. What settled debt collection
essentially is, is when you go into a facility such as ECU Physicians
and in the rural portion of the eastern part of our state, which has a
high propensity for Medicaid, Medicare and cash based based patient, and
you are unable to pay your debt, and after collection attempts of being
able to recoup that debt, we have the ability to be able to recoup that
debt via your tax return. It is a way for us to recoup that debt and
continue to remain solvent. A fiscal note that was prepared in regards
to a Senate Bill where this provision was originally proposed in,
estimates that East Carolina University alone would have lost $5.5
million this fiscal year and up to about $7.7 by 2017-2018. Again, this
is an important provision for us to maintain to allow these providers to
continue to carry out their mission and provide great healthcare in our
rural communities and I urge your support of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the House committee

Ladies and gentlemen of the house I&#39;m really sorry we can&#39;t

hope we still can. This bill should have never come back to us. You all
voted on it. It was passed. Senate voted on it. It was passed. There was
a lawsuit and there was an injunction placed on the bill. There&#39;s
still lots of legal questions hanging out there. And here at the 11th

  <p>a session is shutting down. Last night, early this morning, a new bill
was drafted. Our city council has not seen it as a whole. One council
member was a part of some of the discussion last night, late last night,
and then this morning. He had some input as for what you see in here,
the Monitoring Commission Committee. And then at 12:40 today, he sent me
a text and said &quot;Please take that out; I was talking about coupling
that with our bill, which is the city&#39;s proposal, before you pass
the bill out of here.&quot; This new bill before you has not even begun
to be fully vetted. Not even begun to look at all the problems that may
be within it. And our city manager, and his advice from some of the
council members, I don&#39;t know how many; I&#39;m not a part of that
(it&#39;s been a very long day). But there&#39;s one glaring piece in
here that&#39;s new to this bill, and I need for you to know about this
because from the time we recessed we had this bill earlier. And to this
point, I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people, some attorneys. And
there&#39;s a section in here that the day that the bill became law from
the Senate, the city filed an injunction and the city seated city
airport aviation director submitted his resignation because they stunned
(???) a law that was passed. He was the new director of the authority.
But the city&#39;s injunction being filed, and his resignation, they
removed him. As they should have; that&#39;s the process. They put in
his place, as was stated early and ??? to me, well not a nice way, the
new intermittent aviation director, Brent Cagle. Comes with an
incredible resume. He&#39;s learned at the hand of Jerry Orr in the
short time he&#39;s been there. So he is running the airport, and very
competent. But in this bill is a new section, and it comes more and more
to light, you know the more you read something the more it&#39;s talked
about, which we should be doing with every bill up here. You see flaws,
but you rise (???), &quot;why we&#39;re doing this?&quot; We&#39;re
doing this bill to get Jerry Orr back in his job. This section says,
you&#39;re doing this bill, and I&#39;m not doing this, the commission
on behalf of the city shall, page 7 of the bill--read it some time--be
deemed as a matter of law to have appointed as its initial executive
director the aviation director of the city of Charlotte as of February
14, 2013, retroactive, with initial compensation and benefits of the
initial executive director, being the same compensation and benefits as
were being received from the city of Charlotte on February 14. Give him
back his job. Well what I found out, is this now raises a completely new
constitutional defect under the special privileges clause. And it
probably could also be deemed unconstitutional private act relating to
employment. A state government in a new law repealing a law that is held
in the courts right now. A state government dictating who a city
government may hire. I have never heard of this. I have asked numerous
people that have served up here before. They&#39;ve never heard of it...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Marney, I apologize for interrupting you, but because of the midnight
hour upon us we are going to adjourn. And we will come back in about
four or five minutes so that we can let you continue the debate on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll hold my thought.

and now it&#39;s time to rev them up again. Thank you for the little
interlude. I just want to remind you again that his bill does not need
to be here. There is no rhyme or reason for it to be here. Our city has
not had the chance to view it as a complete council with our mayor and
our managers  and our lawyers. This is one councilmen talking with a
couple of the members up here. And a new bill will appear this morning

  <p>...my computer and my colleague&#39;s computer at 9:30.  That is no way
to do business for the state of North Carolina.  That is no way for us
to treat local governments.  We&#39;ve already done it to them, to the
city, last week.  Why turn around and add insult to injury because you
can.  No need to do that.  No need to keep the lingering uncertainty
over the community.  No need to take a purported compromise, and
that&#39;s a quote from the city, and turn it into a product that was
not a product of negotiations with the city.  You can say we talked to
the city if you talk to one councilman?  No.  Not when you&#39;re doing
legislation of this magnitude.  Not with the implications that it has.
And certainly not, when we still have in question with this new bill.
Our Constitution says that we cannot write laws for one citizen.  And
that&#39;s what this bill does.  It&#39;s for one citizen to get his job
back.  Again, this bill has no business being before us.  The question
of whether the governance of the airport in Charlotte should change or
not has never been debated.  It&#39;s just been deemed.  And here we are
at the eleventh hour, about to shut down government tomorrow, and you
have no recourse.  Please don&#39;t do this.  I know you&#39;re going to
vote for it.  We don&#39;t...it&#39;s just pointless for us to stand
here and beat our chest over this.  You&#39;re going to move forward.
And with all the legalities that are still surrounding this, that
numerous attorneys have said there are still questions, we&#39;ll
probably be right back here again.  I ask you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I&#39;ll be very brief.  We&#39;ve talked about
this around and around.  I just do want to point out that up to this
point we really have not had opportunity to either debate or to research
the merits of a purported authority versus continued city control as a
department or some other form of appropriate governance.  Now I know
that in our long days it becomes a spectator sport for members to watch
large metropolitan delegations tear themselves apart as one group of
legislators from county X argues against another group from the same
county and how people from various parts of these counties purport to
represent the people.  Well, we do know from survey data that the people
in Mecklenberg County are not clamoring for change.  They&#39;re quite
satisfied with an airport that is managed in the traditional manner by
the city.  As Representative Carney has pointed out, we really don&#39;t
know what the genesis of this change is.  We just know that it&#39;s
here, and we just know that it&#39;s moving forward.  The last thing
that I want to leave you with as you enjoy the delegates from
Mecklenberg County having at each other at discussing policy, especially
those of you from Guilford, those you from Asheville, those of you from
Durham, those of you from Wake, where you have from time to time in the
last six months experienced some variation of the same problem, tonight
it is us.  Tonight, Mecklenberg is going to feel the power of the
majority as it exercises its will.  Well, it&#39;s us tonight.  It&#39;s
going to be one of you next week.  [AUDIO ENDS]

will join with me.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blazer please state
your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and I&#39;m not going to engage
on the merits of the dispute. I don&#39;t know enough to do that. But I
am going to engage on three points of law. First, you can repeal and
this body has, legislation but we can&#39;t repeal a lawsuit and they
are independent of each other. Second I&#39;ve read the temporary
restraining order and if the act that we pass today we just dealing with
the first ?? of the TRO I agree with the majority that their bound
together. But there is a second third and fourth ?? of the TRO which are
absolutely fundamentally unrelated to the act that was passed and enjoin
particular actions by the state and I am very sure that this state will
now be subject to contempt of court for a violation of that order should
this bill that we pass be enforced or try to be enforced. If there is
not a resolution by parties in Charlotte. And third practice law as an
employment and labor lawyer for fifteen years and if the majority can
show me any case or any bill that has every been passed by this general
assembly that ordered the hiring of by a municipal and local government
of a particular employee that meets constitutional specifications I
would like to know it. What possible authority we have to order a
municipality to hire a specific employee, none I suspect, and what
authority says we can&#39;t I suspect and I fear in the next round of
litigation we will find out but I believe multiple provisions of the
constitution bar it and I am sad that we have added that into the bill
for whatever your view is the Charlotte dispute. And for all the legal
reasons that I believe this opens up enormous constitutional challenges,
opens up the tax payers to a fine and being held in contempt of court
and because this is just wrong as a matter of law on so many levels I
will be voting no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the house is to
pass this to the house committee substitute to senate bill 480 on its
third reading all in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will
open the vote. The clerk will out machine will record the vote. 67 have
voted the affirmative and 40 in the negative the house committee
substitute senate bill 380 has passed its third reading. Will be sent to

related to health care costs reduction and transparency ?? in the joint
Carolinian act.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam please state your
purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] To offer and amendment but I don&#39;t see
it on the dashboard there.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the members will
be at ease I think the clerk is adding it to the dashboard. The clerk
