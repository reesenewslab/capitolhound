Our Father and our all mighty God, maker of Heaven and earth, we, your
people, humbly bow before your throne acknowledging you as the creator
and sustainer of life and that life being eternal. Let us come into your
presence with praise and thanksgiving. Thankful indeed for your grace
and your mercies that are new every morning. We pray for wisdom and
discernment that we may honor you in what we do and also the manner in
which we do it. Help us to love good, to hate sin, and to know your word
that we would see the difference. We pray that righteousness would
prevail as your word tells us that righteousness exalts a nation. Lord
help us that we be exalted and not condemned. And as we extoll the
virtues of liberty, help us not be deceived by the sins of license. We
pray for understanding and courage to speak the truth, but also to do so
in love, as love will cover a multitude of sins. Help us to be kind to
one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another even as God in Christ
offers forgiveness to us according to your word. And father, as we offer
this prayer, we are indeed thankful that you have ordained our steps
that we may freely assemble and offer prayer in this legislative body as
our nation has sanctioned and practiced from its beginning. May it
always be according to your will. Great is thy faithfulness. Help us,
your people, to be thankful. With each one here praying in their own
way, I offer my prayer in the name of my Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.

The 10th  anniversary of his death section 3 French [??] shall transmit
the certified copy of this resolution to the family of Tony Clayton Sami
and section 4 this resolution is effective upon the [??].
[Speaker Changes] Representative Miguel is recognized right now to
debate the resolution
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker and fellow representatives of
the chamber. Somehow you may remember that I mentioned Deputy Tony
Sami’s name during the debate on Senate bill 306 back in early June.
That started me thinking that this was his tenth anniversary of his
death. He was killed in  2003. I thought it was very fitting then it
will be a good opportunity to recognize his love, his memory and the
sacrifices he made for his fellow men. After consulting with the family,
it was decided that I would do a house resolution honoring the love and
memory of deputy  Tony Sami . You would have known the reading of the
resolution some of Tony’s history. Time today is too short to say all
that could be said and  should be said about the life of Tony Sami. I
will start by saying that from the first day that Tony started his job
as a deputy Sheriff, every one that came in contact with him all his
fellow officers  knew that Tony had found his mutual love and he would
make an excellent law enforcement officer. It was his last calling.
Something that he  wanted to do.  Tony soon became a valued member of
the Sheriff’s wife and trusted deputy in his community. Since his death
many have told stories about Tony’s type and they would check on them on
neighboring widows and aging loved ones even when he was off duty. And
he didn’t have to do it. He had other things in his life. When he was on
duty . when time allowed. Tony was a dedicated husband and provider for
his wife and children and Tony never met a stranger and he would strike
up a conversation with anyone at any time about any subject. Tony was
described as loving, soft hearted and selfless. He was known in his
community as a husband, a daddy, a deputy, a friend and a neighbor. I
worked with Tony from 1999 until his death. In 2003. I can tell you
first hand that Tony Sami was a hard working  dedicated loyal and trust
worthy man. Tony was a big man Sometimes his size was a little bit
intimidating to you. But I Can tell you from knowing him and all the
people that know him will tell you that Tony’s love for his fellow men
and the big heart he had was much bigger than the size of his body. And
looking back over my  32 year career in  law enforcement no single day
has made me sadder than the Sunday April 27th 2003, the day Tony Sami
laid down his life while serving his mankind and community. And that’s
day  God called him home to be with him. In law enforcement we have
what we call ten codes. And ten codes are basically the codes we use
each code we use has a different meaning. I don’t think it’s a any small
coincidence that house resolution 1020. The ten code for it and Randolph
county is Where are you and what is your location. I don’t think any
body in this chamber or anybody that knew Tony Sami can doubt where Tony
Sami 1020 yesterday. Tony Sami is in heaven. Tony Sami was a good man.
Tony Sami’s funeral was on Thursday May the 1st 2003 and I will be for
ever honored that myself and two other officers of the Sheriff’s office
were honored to be able  to sing at Tony’s funeral.  As the son of how
well Tony was loved in his community, all of the officers and citizens
that showed for the funeral even for a small portion of the them could
not be contained by the  church  and many were made to stand outside.
The Van of the Police vehicles, fire trucks and every thing going from
the church to cemetery stretched for miles. It’s even been busier as the
funeral procession was reaching the cemetery some 20 miles away vehicles
were still leaving the Church where the Ceremony was held.. I would
close by encouraging each of you to go the officer town memorial page
can be very easily found on the internet to read more about the life of
Deputy Tony Sami, there is a blog page on there.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 547 the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Committee ?? for Senate Bill 547. A bill to be entitled, An Act To
Amend The Statutes Governing Guaranteed Energy Savings Contracts For
Governmental Units. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Hager please state your purpose. Please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the Rules Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rules
Chair is it okay to do this one? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Senate Bill 547 deals with energy conservation audits and implementation
of the findings. Specifically this  bill addresses how do you handle the
contracts, who handles the contracts, how are they awarded, what kind of
guaranteed savings do you have and how are they dealt with. Part of the
bill that we amended in Senate Finance allows the universities that have
engineering curriculum to specifically have energy curriculums in those
engineering curriculums, to do the audits themselves also, those are the
North Carolina Sate and UNC Charlotte. And I ask for you to vote green
on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I
filed a companion bill to this earlier and I think it's a very good
bill. Right now this is performance contracting where energy service
companies guarantee energy savings and they get paid based on their
performance. And if they don't get the savings that they're supposed to
get they don't get paid. They have to actually give the money back. But
the process is sort of a design build process where these contractors
have to go ahead and do their design and make all their guarantees
before they get selected and so it could cost them up to $100,000 per
project to do that.</p>

<p id="020:00">
And ultimately that additional cost that they get gets put into the
future project.  So what this does is a qualification-based selection
where you select the top two qualified energy service companies, and
then you work out the details.  So it should be a savings for everybody,
and I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask Representative Hager a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, you indicated that schools that had schools of
engineering were being asked to do their own audit on this.  Why was
A&amp;T State University included in that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, I guess because no one was there to represent
A&amp;T.  I mean within that time, NC State already had the opportunity
to do it.  This bill would have sunsetted that opportunity.  They knew I
was, as you know, I was intimately involved with UNC-Charlotte, so I
knew they had it.  It may have just been ignorance on my part.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, may I ask him a further question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you allow us to amend this to but A&amp;T State University in
there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

I think she's going to be working on that Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Thank you.

to this Bill. It is identical to the exact same thing that you have
heard on this floor three times. It’s just being placed on this Bill and
I respectfully request that you vote for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not the question
before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Daughtry to the House Committee Substitute for Senate
Bill 480. All in favor vote, “Aye.” All opposed vote, “No.” The Clerk
will open the vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. 104 having voted in the
affirmative and two in the negative the amendment passes and despite
Representative Moore’s best efforts to move this Bill today, the
amendment does change the title, so it will be carried over.
Ladies and gentleman, Senate Bill 321 is properly before us.
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The Clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative T. Moore moves to amend the Bill on Page one, Lines seven
and eight by rewriting the lines to read…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, if I may be recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members, what this simply does is this removes the
provision of Senate Bill 321 that had to do with the Register of Deeds
hours. That has been moved to the other bill to put that in conference.
We’d ask for the members’ support of the amendment and I’ll be glad to
debate the Bill thereafter if there’s any further debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further debate on the amendment? If not, the question before the House
is the passage of the amendment offered by Representative Moore for the
House Committee Substitute Number Three for House Bill Number 321. All
in favor vote, “Aye.” All opposed vote, “No.” The Clerk will open the
vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. 107 having voted in the
affirmative and one in the negative the amendment passes. Representative
Moore is on a roll. The amendment changes the title, it will be carried
over for a third reading.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair understands that there is an amendment
pending from Representative Jackson on this bill. We will go ahead and
take that up at this time.  Representative Jackson is recognized to send
forth an amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson moves to amend the bill on page
1 lines 5 through 7 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, this, my amendment would delete Section 4 which is the section
that deals with appointment of district court judges by the Governor. I
believe Section 4 is a section that is bad for the judiciary. It believe
it should’ve gone through the judiciary committee for debate. I wanted
to point out just a couple of problems out with this. I was emailing
Jarod Cohen last night to make sure I was correct on this, and I want to
read you his email. I asked him would that mean if we knew a judge was
retiring on December 31st, currently the bar can meet in advanced, can
give the names to the Governor in advanced, and the Governor can make
that appointment just like many of us do when we came here. We were
appointed within days of the vacancy. I asked him would the governor be
allowed to do that, and his response was no, that I was correct. Under
no circumstances may the vacancy be filled sooner within 30 days after
the vacancy occurs. So for those of you who have judicial districts that
have only one judge or two judges, you’ll have no judge for a month. So
you’ll have no court for the entire month. There’s no way around it. So
if you represent a small county with only one judge in it, I want you to
think about that. If you represent a county that has two judges, can
that one judge that’s left there for a month, can he cover court in two
counties, on the same day? I mean this is a rule that we don’t apply to
ourselves. We try to have our new members- Welcome by the way- in their
seat immediately upon resignation, but the language that is in this bill
will require for that seat to remain open for 30 days. That’s the first
problem. The second problem I see with the bill with the change of
language is currently the Governor, if the judge is elected by partisan
election, the Governor must appoint someone from the same party. Now I
know that currently district court judges are non-partisan elections,
but you've all seen the bills as I have and heard the rumors that might
be changing in the next few days. If that was to change, the Governor
would not have to appoint someone from the same party. They would be
free to select someone from a different party. Is that a rule that we’re
going to apply to ourselves? When one of us steps down are we going
allow the Governor to pick somebody from either party to replace that
person, or are we going to honor the wishes of the electret, the prior
election, to pick the Democrat or to pick the Republican for that seat?
For those two reasons I think that this is a bad bill. The final reason
I think that the Section 4 language is problematic is because there is
no automatic provision, and I don’t know how often this is used. But
currently if the Governor does not appoint someone within 60 days, the
person who got the most votes in the District Bar Election is appointed.
Right now, the way this is there’s no, what I call escape hatch and that
means a vacant seat could remain open indefinitely until the next
election if the Governor didn't want to appoint someone to that seat for
whatever reason. I don’t think that’s going to be very helpful to our
judiciary as well. I’d ask you to support the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, the language that
is in the provision that Representative Jackson is trying to remove is
language that actually after we had a discussion that I consulted with
Representative Daughtry who chairs the full judiciary committee who have
an interest in it, along with Representative Stevens and others. Of
course, this was originally from Representative Burr’s bill. This is a
modification of the language that Representative Burr had that simply
says that the bar shall nominate five names, that the Governor shall
give due consideration to those names, and then the Governor has the
ultimate ability and right to make an appointment. Now in practical
matter what that’s going to mean is that the Governor is going to pick
from those five unless the Governor were to find all five of those
particular individuals objectionable for some reason, and so what this
does it gives our Governor who is elected the right to make that
decision. As opposed to tying the hands of the Governor from a
recommendation from a bar, which I’m a member of the bar as well as Mr.
Jackson and all the other folks who are attorneys in here, we’re members
of our local bar, but we’re not elected. We passed the bar exam. We stay
in good standing practicing law, and we’re licensed attorneys. And yes,
we do have knowledge that we garner from observing folks, their
demeanor, or how they practice law, their worth ethics so forth so that
we can have some input. And this bill maintains that, but</p>

<p id="040:00">
At the end of the day, those of us are attorneys and members of the
local bar should not have the right to tie the hands of the governor,
who was elected by the people.  I think it's almost elitist to think
that we as attorneys should somehow control the courthouse that much.
That's just not right. So with that being said, members, I would urge
you to vote against the gentleman's amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Turner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To inquire of the amendment's sponsor a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Jackson, you said that if there were no judge appointed thn there
would not be a judge available for sessions of court during that time
perio.  Would they not appoint an emergency judge?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be up to AOC.  They could do that, depending on their budget
for the year.  If it's towards the end of the budget year, and they've
used up their emergency judge funds for whatever reason, they wouldn't
be able to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, could I be recorded as voting aye on senate bill 480.  I
was in the chamber, and was unable to get back to my seat.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman records having voted aye.  Representative Speciale, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Moore would yield for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Glad to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, I'm concerned about that 30 day loss of a judge.
Could you address that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, right now, under the current regimen that could happen presently.
The way it is right now, there could be a delay right now, and the way
it is right now, the only difference that's happening here
representative Speciale is the current law states that if the governor
simply failed to act.  If the Governor just sat on his hands, which the
governor's not going to do.  They're going to appoint these judgeships.
Otherwise, there's no difference.  What this bill does is it calls for
five names, instead of three, and it gives the governor the flexibility
if he finds those five names, all of those five to be objectionable, to
not do it.  As far as any delays in time, in all honesty that's not a
real concern, and if the governor did sit on his hand and didn't make
the appointment for some reason, miss Turner, representative Turner who
is a former registered clerk of court, who knows more about the courts
than any lawyers.  The clerks of court have to run the operation.
Pointed out correctly that in that case the AOC  would appoint what's
called an emergency judge to come in and work and cover those cases.
And emergency judges rotate through all the time.  And I cannot imagine
any scenario where the AOC would allow a judicial district to just go
without a district court judge functioning in that instance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And more specifically, to answer the representative Speciale's
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, the lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, debate the amendment.  Representative Speciale, we actually
had a judge who was killed, drowned over the 4th of July holiday, in
neighboring Wilkes county.  A judge has not been appointed to fill his
position yet.  The bar is working on making their recommendations.  The
judges in our district are consolidating some of their courts, and
actually going in serving in that area and filling in his courts.  There
is a provision that the court does not go unattended or undone, just
because there is a death or a lapse in the placement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??, Play state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  The ladies and gentlemen, the rules
chair raises I think some valid questions about the current methods with
which we replace judges.  There's a lot of room out there for an open
and honest and an extensive discussion on changes that might be made
there.  But regardless of where you stand in that debate, what I think
we should all agree on is that there needs to be some system of checks
and balances, some check from somebody outside the executive branch on
the unfettered power of a governor from either party to appoint judges.
That's how it's done elsewhere, that's how it's done at the federal
level.  So if you want to get rid of the current system, that's great.
I'll probably be with you on some changes.  But let's don't do it until
we find a better way to provide those checks and balances. So I urge you
to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.

To let you know about the conversations that I’ve had over the past, I
don’t know, twelve, twelve or so hours. Some of my colleagues have
expressed concern and I respect it but this is somehow or this is an
unfunded mandate on the counties and that’s the reason they voted no
yesterday. I will submit to you respectfully that this is a situation
where the counties and the DNV agreed to something back in 2005. I
actually have the Memorandum of Understanding somewhere on my desk here
and we can, we can discuss that. So since two thousand, 2005, we have
waited and it just so happens there's ’ date on it, we have waited until
June eighteenth two thousand and thirteen to tell these private small
businesses what they were going to do and how they were going to do it
and more importantly, what they were going to be paid. So I will submit
to you that it is perhaps an underfunded mandate on small business.
Again, the tag ‘agents’ back in 05 opposed this Bill. They didn’t want
the responsibility of collecting this tax. They were given the
responsibility anyway. They were required to do it by law, by statute
??. They’re saying they need the level of fee that’s in this Bill in
order to be able to carry out a profitable transaction. In the
Memorandum that I mentioned earlier which was signed, pardon me ??, in
the fourteenth page Memorandum of Understand, Understanding it’s very
interesting. If you look at page two, it shows the parties to the
agreement. Let me tell you who they were, the folks who sat down in the
room. It was the North Carolina department of Revenue, the North
Carolina department of Transportation, North Carolina Association of
County Commissioners and the North Carolina League of Municipalities.
Nowhere in this list or nowhere on the signature page or these licensed
tax agencies. They’ve not been at the table throughout this. We are
requiring them to collect the tax. I shared with you numbers yesterday
that nobody disputes that more tax will be collected and remitted to the
counties. I also disclosed and it was not refuted, in fact I think it
was supported. There is, there is an increased cost to the counties if
this Bill goes through but it’s more than offset by the additional
revenue that comes in. I believe that passing this Bill is important.
There’s going to be some talk today about studying the issue. Let me be
clear. I think that’s a logical approach that should’ve begun in 2005.
It’s very unfortunate to say, we’re going to manually start doing this
mail. We’re going to pay you less than you say you’ve got to have to do
this and we’re also going to study it to decide how much you should be
paid. Please note on page thirteen and I didn’t spend the money to have
this produced, on page thirteen of this agreement or this Memorandum of
Understanding, it calls for the department to do a study of what the
actual cost are and to report back to us so that we can set the fee
based on the actual cost. So everyone’s aware that we really don’t know
what we were doing. So what I would ask you respectfully is to air on
the side of a small business horizon that’s being compelled by law.</p>

...to do something that they didn't ask for. Please vote green for this
bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Submit amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale moves to amend the bill on
page 2, line 5, through page 3, line 24, by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Craven, Representative Speciale has
the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, this is an amendment to study
the fees. I tried to find out yesterday where these numbers came from.
Obviously, they're based on Representative Lewis' comments. It's coming
from the contractor, who doesn't want to do this in the first place.
Well, the normal procedure would be to go out for bids and find somebody
who does want to do this and who will give us an accurate fee rate after
we've studied and made sure that we know what it should cost.
The North Carolina Association of County Commissioners is against this.
The tax collectors across the State are against this. There's opposition
everywhere on this bill, or on this particular section here. And again,
these are random numbers. It looks to me, this is my opinion and I don't
discount anything that Representative Lewis has done or whoever has
worked on this bill. I'm sure they did everything the best that they
could. But it concerns me that the contractor is getting his rates based
on legislative action and that's not the way we normally would do this.
If the contractor doesn't want to do the job in the first place, then
let it go out for bids and find somebody who does want to do it and
we'll get the best rate.
This is a lot of money coming out of the county coffers. So I hope
you'll consider this and you'll support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick,
Representative Iler rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] See if Representative Lewis will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the gentleman
from Brunswick? He does?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, during the recent comments we
just heard, someone kept saying, the representative kept saying
contractor. Isn't this dozens of little contractors that we're dealing
with here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, may I be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To respond to the question and make further comments
as necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually this was an inquiry to the Chair or perhaps
the Clerk and I apologize. I try to stay up on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can't pull up the Speciale amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will be at ease just a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My seatmate is smarter than me, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman have the amendment before him now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to respond to the question
and to take time as he needs reading the, reading the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you all for your
patience. I don't know what I'm doing wrong here, but. The thing that I
have, the concern that I have with the amendment set forth by the
gentleman from Craven, if you'll look at it, what it does is calls for
revenue laws to study this. I don't in theory have any objection to
that. The problem is we're going to require that these small businesses,
a lot of these things, literally one and two person offices start to
collect these taxes on behalf of the counties at a rate they say they
can't afford to do. We're going to require them to go ahead and do that
at the lower rate while we look into it.
What the bill does is say we're going to let them, we would like for
them to have a rate that is higher than the 48 cents that's being
proposed in the memorandum of understanding, and we're going to study
the issue to see what the rate should be set at. So my objection to the
amendment, as I read it, is not the study. Now, I've really messed up
your computer, Linda. Is not the objection of the study of this issue,
it's the concern that we're going to...</p>

the amendment can be somehow be perfected to the pointed that it just
required the additional legislative study, I will have to respectfully
ask you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion on the amendment. There are several lights on. For
what purpose the gentleman from Onslow Representative Cleveland rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentlemen from Harnett, Representative Lewis, does the
gentleman yield to a question from Onslow?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For clarification, Representative Lewis, if I understood you correctly
in your last statements, you said that in the bill we are actually
providing more funding to the contractor than was in the original
memorandum of understanding?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. That’s correct. It’s just very, very important to note,
Representative, that the parties to the memorandum of understanding did
not include any of the tag agents that actually had to do the work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman wishes to prepare an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Harnett yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Department of Transportation was involved in that memorandum of
understanding, were they not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And one follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to a final question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the present bill, we’re paying more than the original memorandum of
understanding. And we’re also requiring a study to be conducted so we
can establish what the individual contractors actually need to perform
this duty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that, Representative. Just to be clear, in the original
bill that was filed in 2005 said that the contractors who collect this,
which, I know you’re probably more familiar with this than many of us in
the chamber, there are some tag agencies that the state itself operates,
but most of them are through private contract with small businesses. In
the 2005 bill, as it was filed, the language says that the contractors,
the small businesses the tax and tag agencies, would be paid a fee to
cover their cost of doing this. When it came time to decide, again, this
is 2005, by the time this memorandum came out, it was January of 2013.
Not only was it January of 2013, but the people that we’re requiring to
do something weren’t at the table and weren’t a part of the conversation
to decide what the fee should be. The only last point I’d like to make,
and I don’t mean to belabor this answer, but I would encourage members
when they have time, to take a look at the report done by the program
evaluation last year where they looked at how much more efficient the
local tag agency offices are than the state run ones. They were amazed
at how much it actually cost us to run the state one. I would submit to
you that while, yes, the Department of Transportation through the DMV
was in fact a party to this MOU, I’m not sure they know exactly what the
cost of doing a transaction is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose the lady from Surry, Representative Stevens rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Clearly, we’re going to be giving more money to
the license plate agencies than they normally get. That’s what this bill
does. The amendment he sent forth says let’s study it, let’s see what
they’re supposed to get. I would call your attention to the memorandum
of understanding that Representative Lewis was going, and what it says
on page 9, sub-paragraph D: All operational costs incurred by DOT...</p>

Department of Revenue, State Treasurer, and calls paid to 3rd party
vendors for processing electronic payments and merchant cards will be
deducted from the monthly distributions on a pro-rata basis.  So they're
all getting their money out of the tax money before it goes back to the
county.  Costs paid to each 3rd party vendor will be based upon the
average cost per transaction for all transactions processed by the
vendor adjusted for costs not related to vehicle property tax payments.
Such adjustments will be based upon the percentage of non-vehicle tax
amounts portion of the payment transaction retained by the DOT to the
total amount.  Once they have this memorandum of the understanding of
how they were going to compute the payment, they have attached the
operation costs.  It's currently costing $0.48 as the average cost for
every transaction that the tag agency does.  Now they're asking you to
double or triple it without truly knowing what the costs are.  So at
this point, we have set forth the average transaction cost.  I'll be
happy to share this with anyone who wants to see.  And by the way,
there's been talk of the counties need to be able to, an willing to bear
this expense because they're going to do a such greater job of
collection.  They're going to do a greater job of collection if they
don't have to pay this extra fee.  They've already got a fee built in
here for the license plate agency, what they're asking you to do in this
bill is increase that by double or triple.  So again, I ask you to
support the amendment, so we can study it, and review and figure out
whether this system, which again I don't like the whole system, but this
is certainly making it a lot worse on the counties.  It is an unfunded
mandate.
For what purpose does the gentleman from Randolph, Representative
McNeill rise?
To ask the bill's sponsor a question.
Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the gentleman from Randolph?
Yes, Mr. Speaker.
He yields.
Representative Lewis, during this whole process over the last 8 years
when there was discussion, I think originally about this original fee, I
would think was the $0.48,  is that correct?
Representative McNeill, I think that's the fee that's contemplated in
the memorandum of understanding, I don't know.  Representative Stevens
may be more equipped to answer that than I am.  When the original bill
was proposed in '05, it said that it would cover the costs, and as far
as I know the January 2013 memorandum is the first time that attempt was
made. And again, it was made without the involvement of those that
actually do the work.
The gentlemen will suspend just a moment, Representatives Howard, Lewis,
and Stezer are recognized to send forth a committee report, the clerk
will read.
Representatives Howard, Lewis, and Stezer for the finance committee, in
Bill 420, UI clarify required contributions, favorable to House
Committee substitute on favorable is to the Senate Committee substitute.
Senate Committee substitute based on the unfavorable calendar, the House
Committee substitute's calendar, and without objection will be
calendared for today.  Is there any objection?  Hearing none, it will be
so calendared.  The gentleman from Randolph continues to have the floor
to ask an additional question to the gentleman from  Harnett, he yields.
 The gentleman may state his question.
In the original negotiations, are you whether this issue on some of
these T stickers was part of the original memorandum of agreement?
Thank you for that inquiry.  Sir, I'm not aware if it was a part of the
original discussion or not, I know that the automobile vehicular's
expressed some concern, and that's where the provision came from.
Follow up.
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?  He yields.
Would you not think it fair then, Representative Lewis, that if
something was added to these tag agencies, a new thing that they had to
do, added to them from the original, that the price should be higher?
I would certainly agree with that, yes.
Thank you.
For what purpose does the lady from Surry, Representative Stevens, rise?
To see if I can ask Representative McNeill a question.
Does the gentleman from Randolph yield to the lady from Surry?
Reluctantly, but yes.
He yields.
The lady may state her inquiry.
Thank you. Representative McNeill, did you know that is $0.48 is a fee
simply for collecting that property tax, and not for anything else, the
new fee.
Yes I do, and may I elaborate.
The gentleman does have the floor to respond to the question as he sees
fit.</p>

<p id="070:00">
as I understand it, and that's why I'm up asking these questions, I was
told when I went to the tag agency with one of my commissioners last
Friday, that this addition of this T-sticker was something that was
added on and was not part of the original agreement. When everybody was
talking about 48 cents, and it's an addition that they're being asked to
do for free if the price does not increase, but that's my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Does the gentleman yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes. He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
And isn’t the T-sticker just the verification that the taxes have in
fact been paid? So, in essence, that's what it was, it's something to
show the receipt that the taxes have been paid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
It's, as I understand it, it's part of the process, but it's a new part
of the process that was added, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rowan, Representative Ford,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
This is a new fee. It's a new tax. It's an additional fee, it's going to
cost our counties money. It's an additional layer of government, which
I'm against. I don't want to add any more layers of government. Sure the
LPA's need more money. Why? Because we've added on something and because
they're losing business. Walk-ins, more people are getting their tags
now by way of mail and online. I'd rather do that than go stand in line
at the tag office. And we're taking money out of our county pockets. So
these fees do need to be studied. Right now the county is doing this
whole process for less than a dollar. If this goes through, it's going
to cost the county, my county, between five and six dollars per
transaction. Right now the consumer is paying the credit card part of
the transaction. If this goes through, the county will be paying this
part of the transaction, adding additional fees to the county. I'm
talking to my tax administrators, costing us a quarter million dollars
minimum if this goes through, probably much more. We do need to study
the fees. It's yet another tax and another layer of government. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To speak in favor of the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
In speaking to the sponsor of the amendment, he raised enough doubt in
my mind to understand it from more of a business, I guess, perspective
and that is, often time it's no great secret that if you're in a
business to do X and someone approaches you and wants X, but a little
more that may be out of your expertise, or what you currently do. And
you really don't want to do that work, and you'd prefer not to do that
work, but you're there to actually help the guy. You may end up charging
just a little bit more. Because it's just beyond your expertise. You may
need a special tool, you may need a special device. You just may need
something other than what you normally throughput your facility. So I've
heard different colleagues of mine, the business sector call it a
nuisance charge, or an up cost or whatever. Especially if it's outside
of what you currently do.
That being said, the folks were contracted to do a specific. They were
priced for that specific. It's obvious we're changing that, so it's
obvious there should be a cost adjustment. But the way I understand it,
the way we do cost adjustments in this state, typically, is to look at
it, figure out mutually how much it's going to be, and make an
adjustment. I think that's what we're trying to do, but it concerns me
that a good analysis of the up charge or the additional fee that we may
be trying to impose, at this point in time, at least in my mind, hasn’t
been adequately defined.
So what I'd hope we'd do is during that study period, as brief as it can
possibly be, it can be determined that we work on a methodology to alter
the current contract, or perhaps resubmit bids out for contracts, and do
it the way that we would normally conduct business.
And thank you for your time, and I support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
For what purpose does the gentleman from Moore, Representative Boles,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To debate the amendment and ask the bill sponsor friendly questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Does the gentleman wish to ask the question first?
Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the gentleman from Moore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I do, Mr...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Just for clarification, we're talking about private, licensed
contractors, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK. And I've talked with my local contractor, and the last fee change
that they had was in 2000. If you can confirm, or if you have knowledge
of that?</p>

<p id="075:00">
Representative Boles, I know that it's been some years, but I wouldn't
want to state on the floor something that I'm not certain of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And then there was another question that...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker. Can I ask another
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Also, she stated that the fee structures were, they
have to come through the General Assembly for approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
Right. And I'd like to debate the bill. I meant amendment, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from ?? has the floor to debate the
amendment. Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right. Thank you. I would hope that we would defeat
this amendment. It's been stated, it's been studied. It's a program
that's been trying to be implemented since 2005. I can assure you that
private sector does a much better job when it comes to processing. I
would hope that with these independent license plate agencies that we
have is that they've been in limbo since 2005 about what's going to
happen. The county commissioners and everybody else has been working on
this program. It's in place. It's ready to go.
And I hope that we would defend this, defeat this amendment and that we
can help the agencies that are doing a good job. I talked to my county
manager. He had a concern that he thought that they may lose money, but
on the flip side he said he really couldn't confirm that because they're
not going to have to go out and collect. He said we're not going to have
to send second, third, fourth, fifth notices. The mail should drop, mail
costs. And the expense of tracking down property owners.
So with this, I ask that you defend this amendment and that we vote for
the bill and as stated before, there's been no change to the license
agencies since 2000. Vote no on the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wilkes,
Representative Elmore rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have an additional amendment to offer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. We'll come back to you on that. For what purpose
does the lady from Yancey, Representative Presnell rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill's sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the lady from
Yancey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you know how many counties currently run their own
tag agencies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, I do not. That is, in fact, in that
program evaluation report. As I said, I just wouldn't want to state
something that I'm not certain of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just wondering. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Brawley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First, to ask a question of the Representative Lewis
and then to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the gentleman
from Mecklenburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, thank you for taking my question. As I
understand, the fee will go for three months to $1.06 and then drop to,
is it 71 cents, or...let's say slightly less than 80. More than 70, less
than 80.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And this fee's being imposed without negotiation on a
function that's also being imposed on a private individual?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Mecklenburg has the floor to debate
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I would oppose the amendment and part of
the reasons why, you know I ran a bill on collection costs for 911 fees
on prepaid cell cards. And during that discovered that people that sell
lottery tickets receive a 7% commission. We're imposing this duty, we're
not asking them to accept it and they say yeah, I'll do it for 48 cents.
We're saying you will do it and this is what we'll pay you. I guarantee
you if we offered them a 7% commission on taxes collected, we would have
no trouble getting them to sign up. But that would mean for every $100
of property tax on a car, they would receive a $7 fee. If we're talking
71 cents on a $100 collection, that's 7/10ths of 1%. If your car tax is
$200, that's 3/10ths of 1%. That's not an outrageous commission. We're
talking, we've got dollars chasing pennies here. And it would seem for
us to impose a duty and offer a fee of less than 80 cents per
transaction, we're not making people rich. If anything, we're probably
being a little overbearing. If anybody should be given the option to opt
out it ought to be the tag dealers. They should be able to say look,
this is not worth the trouble, I don't want to do it for 80 cents. You
all just go ahead and collect it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what...</p>

What purpose does the lady from Randolph , Representative Hurley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of the amendment sponsor please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentlemen from Craven yield to the lady from Randolph?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Representative Speciale, I just wondered if you knew that
this all went online on January, on July the 1st. If this program is
already in process on July 1st.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And follow up please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentlemen yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Andin this bill that we have here and it and it goes to the amendment,
it does appoint an advisory committee that will review the process, so
they already have something in place that will probably know what will
happen with the funding, whether it’s too much or not enough or
whatever. But they are, in this amendment to study when were you
expecting the study to be done? Was it to stop the program or is it to
be done while its ongoing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s to be done while it’s ongoing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Nothing. Follow up please. So when are they to report back? If the study
is done?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to, when it’s appropriate I’d like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen, wish to yield or not to the follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to make a motion so that we can look at this closer
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to make a motion to recalendar this for next week for Monday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The matter before us right now is the amendment. So the first thing we
would do is to make a motion to withdraw the amendment and then the
gentlemen could make a motion to re-calendar without objection. We could
re-calendar, does the gentlemen wish to withdraw the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not without a guarantee to re-calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Special, we’re only one light away, or two lights away
from being able to take a vote on the amendment, the Chair would
encourage because the chair will announce later that next week is very
very very highly likely our last week, everything that we can dispose of
while we’re in session, the Chair would encourage members to make use of
the time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Special you have the floor will you yield to
Representative Lewis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, based on the conversation, the very quick conversation
we had, I believe I understand what the intent that you have as far as
changing the language on this  If it is such that with the Speakers
understanding that your intent is to withdraw this and to resubmit it,
if the vote’s held today would that solve this and let us move along?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would. If I could withdraw this amendment and resubmit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The amendment is withdrawn we will re-calendar. We will move forward
with the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a couple minutes to resubmit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then we will, if the House ?? Representative Lewis, this is on third
reading. So if we take a vote on the bill today. Then we’ve disposed of
the bill it would not be possible for Representative Special to resubmit
this amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquire to the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please, please help me know how to say to you that I believe that there
are other amendment that are in the queue and that I think the gentlemen
from Craven can perfect this and resubmit it before we vote on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, that is one of the kindest ways someone has said
pay attention, Speaker, in my three years as being Speaker and the Chair
appreciates it. So that amendment will be properly withdrawn, we will
take up other amendments, we will provide Representative Speciale with
adequate time to prepare an additional amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Representatives Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the Speciale amendment or one similar to that is adopted, would that
not in fact change the title that caused the third reading to be put off
to Monday anyway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Depends on the content of the revised amendment.

Thank you Mr Speaker.  As with many public policies that this chamber
passes you see its kind of like dropping a pebble into a pool of water,
ripples move out and a little ripple out here has affected something and
we see this in this argument dealing with this bill.  What this
Amendment will do is dealing with this fee it is changing it to a two
fee structure here for six months trying it at a higher fee then six
months trying it at a lower fee to try to pinpoint what the best fee
would be to set because it has been admitted that their kind of shooting
in the dark on the determination of what this fee should be so I think
this Amendment would be a fair way to have a higher mark and then a
lower mark to see where eventually it can be met in the middle and I
would appreciate your support on the Amendment. Thank you

through the normal process none of us has had this in a committee with
the opportunity to truly look at it and get all of the considerations
their asking for a raise without even saying what the extra work is
their having to do. The system is in place they've been collecting their
collecting at 48 cents that's what they get. What this bill says is lets
put off the implementation of this bill until July of next year and have
our revenues committee take a look at it and I would ask for your

...of the tag agency in this situation. The tag agents have been
collecting the tax, the county taxes, since July the 1st of this year.
For the last two and half weeks, the tag agents have become the tax
collectors for the automobile tax. Now the counties are fussing about
their going to lose money. But we've taken the responsibility away from
them. Any reasonable county manager would be able to look at his county
tax office and say you know, now that we don't have this responsibility,
maybe we're over staffed and we can reduce our employees.
But the tag agents have been given this responsibility that they didn't
want and they didn't have any say so over how much they were going to be
compensated for this transaction. So the State said we're going to pay
you 48 cents. Well, what has happened is in the last two and half weeks
the tag agents are saying listen, this is not covering our costs. We
need to make an adjustment to these fees. Now these tag agents are good
people. They're just small business people and they've never been tax
collectors before and when they signed up to run a tag office, they
didn't sign up to get cussings from taxpayers who are mad because they
can't get their tags because their tax hasn't been paid. They've been
put in an awkward situation. Now we've got to collect the property tax
on your automobile or we're not going to give you a tag. And so they're
getting cussings, they're getting fussed at, they're getting accused of
doing things that they've never been accused of, and 48 cents is not
covering the transaction costs. I'm going to ask you just to defeat the
amendment so we can go on with the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ford, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm for this amendment.
There's so much confusion among the counties. I represent two counties.
I asked one of my counties, Cabarrus, they said we need to look at this.
We didn't even think about it. Don't know what it's going to cost us.
I'm waiting to hear back. And Rowan has stepped out over the last couple
of months and told me what it's going to cost them. We need to study
this. I mean it may have been studied for the last eight years, but it
seems to be hitting everybody on the head. Boom. Just like this in the
last few weeks. It is going to cost our counties more money. Our sheriff
just contacted me today by way of e-mail. He's afraid it's going to lock
up the court systems. So there's all kind of questions going on with
this fee and I agree with this amendment for putting it off another
year.
The reason the local tag agencies are making less money is as I stated
earlier, it's because more and more people are getting these online and
through the mail except for Representative Pittman, he doesn't want to
pay for the stamp, but that's another story.
So I would suggest that we support this amendment. And the reason
they're getting cussed out at the tag office is because now they're
collecting taxes. And people that, when they pay taxes, they get a
little ill. The county's already used to handling that. The tag offices
are not. Support this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. As you all heard earlier before, this is started
in 2005. And I guess it's like State government where it's 2013 and
we're still going to say we're going to study it again. I hope that we
would defeat this amendment and we would move on. The system is already
in place and the counties can, they said that the counties are confused.
I don't think they're confused. They've had, they've been in the
discussions and they know what's been going on with the license plate
and I think we need to move on and defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In eight years we ought to have a Ph.D. on this
amendment. We studied this enough. I know in my county the person that
owns the tag office personally and I've been hearing about this for
awhile. And they are losing money. They are being told to collect taxes
now and they haven't been tax collectors before. They're in business to
sell tags, not collect taxes. Now, they're collecting taxes. So I ask
that you defeat this amendment and vote green on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Lewis a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.

<p id="095:00">
Representative Lewis, this bill went into effect July 1 of 13. For the
last 17 days, what is the fee that the tag agents are being paid, today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, I believe it would be 48 cents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, if-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields for a follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry. Excuse me. Representative Lewis, if the
amendment should pass and this study with revenue laws would start in
perhaps September and there would be a report that would be sent forward
in early April for May session, would there be anything to prohibit, in
your opinion, anything that would prohibit a retroactive payment when a
fee is determined to be justified, an increase in a fee, would there be
anything that prohibit that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that question, Representative. The
answer to that is I don’t know that there would be anything necessarily
that would prevent a retroactive payment. It’s an issue of can the
agencies survive until the report is done, and the General Assembly
convenes next May. And then we go back to the counties and tell them,
“Hey you got to pay. We’re going to withhold.” Of course, we never ask
them to write checks. We just withhold more. It looks like to me that
would be a problematic solution to this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow-up question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If in fact this bill does not pass in the next week,
do you believe that there’s jeopardy that these tag agents will not be
able to survive? What will happen to those tag agents?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, it is my sincere and honest opinion,
and please notice I used the word opinion, that there are numerous ones
of these tag agencies that are already on the edge of financial failure
and requiring them to do something that they say costs them more to do
that the state and the county are willing to compensate them for does
mean that there are at least a certain percentage, I don’t know how
many, but there are a certain percentage that are in danger of failure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Lewis. Speak on the
amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I believe that any of these
tag agents fail that it is the responsibility of the state of North
Carolina to look at either replacing those local offices or to further
encourage that these transactions be done by mail. As Representative
Boles stated a few minutes ago, we have studied the issue of tax and
tags, but we’re in the tall weeds now of what the compensation for these
agents should be. And that has never been really thoroughly debated by
either Chamber or of the General Assembly. It is our responsibility to
set those fees and authorize those fees. I’m not asking for more work,
but I will tell you this. It’s the right thing to do, to send it to
revenue laws, and as the current Chair of the House on revenue laws, we
can bring this up in September and do a thorough study. I was here when
the bill was passed, the original bill, the Tax and Tags Bill, and there
has been a promise that the counties will generate and receive a whole
lot more money. The collection rate is going to be a whole lot better. I
tend to believe that because you aren't going to get your tag if you
don’t pay your tax, and I think the concept that Representative ?? had
was a good one, but we have</p>

<p id="100:00">
Prof of that. We have no evidence that this is going to work the way we
hope that it’s going to work. I’m going to ask you to support the
amendment if it’s in your will. The bill did pass in 205 and yes we’ve
messed with it for many many years and it’s in effect.  But it is our
responsibility to see that fees are fair.  Compensation is fair. And I
believe the right thing to do is to allow the revenues and that’s what
that committee is charged to do. Revenue Laws Study Committee. It’s
never been there, it’s never been discussed there, or never been debated
there. So this provision is sent to Revenue Laws and you are allowed to
have a thorough study using  the backup material from the Program
Evaluation Division and if in fact, and if I’m wrong I’ll certainly beg
for forgiveness.  But I believe if the fees are increased as perhaps
they should be, I do not believe there’ s anything that would prohibit
this general assembly next May to put those fees in after a complete
study and know that they’re fair, they’re fair for the tax payer,
they’re fair for the county and they’re also fair for these contractors.
That we cannot retroactively put those fees in play. Remember who is
paying the fees.  It’s your counties. So the counties would understand
there may be a retroactive provision here that they will have to further
compensate the state agencies. But by that time you’ve had almost a year
to see if in fact the collection rate is exceeds or even achieves the
level of collection that we’ve been promised that we’re going to see.
This is the best solution that I can see.  We’ve been here almost an
hour we’ve had this bill almost an hour in finance.  It is a question
it’s a big question that we are charged with doing the right thing. I
don’t know what’s the right fee. Because nobody’s ever shown it to me on
paper But I believe when you get through revenue laws you’ll see it.  I
would ask that you support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I debate the amendment Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen’s recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And first let me offer my most sincere thanks to
the members for their indulgence of this extended conversation.  I did
want to address a prior member spoke about the danger of the private
agencies closing perhaps being replaced with state agencies.  I wanted
to remind the body that the Program and Evaluation Division after a very
thorough study of this issue, that the state agencies simply cost a
whole lot more to run than private agencies do. And so it’s not exactly
a fair thing to say that if they’re struggling now perhaps they should
close because the state government can do it better or the local
government can do it better.  I’d also like to close my remarks Mr.
Speaker, and if I  veer slightly off topic  I apologize. The concern
abut this being studied by revenue laws I believe if members would look
at their dashboard, the gentlemen from Craven is going to send forth an
amendment that does that that I do not intend to oppose I intend to
support. So I think it’s a win win, if we defeat this amendment and pass
the bill and continue to study this issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill sponsor a question, I think, after that last statement.

<p id="105:00">
[Speaker changes.]...terday and I really have struggled to understand
what this is all about.  The thing that bothers me now more than
anything else is the fact that apparently we had one-sided negotiations
to come up with these rates that we're now paying where the government
had lots of representatives and the private sector had none.  I am
concerned about the statement you made a minute ago 'bout possibly some
of these people shutting down because of the price we have negotiated
for them in effect and I could vote for this amendment, which right now
I plan on voting against...if we defaulted to paying them the higher
rate and then revenue laws tell what the rate should be since they
didn't have a seat at the table to start with and my question...I was
just gonna make a comment on this...but my question now is is that
basically what the speciality amendment does? Because I would be in
favor of supporting this amendment if we used the rates that we know
will keep these folks in business until the revenue laws basically
negotiates with both sides and tells what it needs to be so...I guess
that's my question since you know more about this than I do.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir. The amendment that Representative Speciale
will send forward would allow the fees that the private agencies have
said they need to be paid in order to collect this tax to go into effect
and then revenue laws would review it and recommend back to the General
Assembly how the fees should adjust.
[Speaker changes.] More comment then, please?
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] In that case I think I would vote...ask the body to
please defeat this amendment and pass the next one.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To debate the amendment as...
[Speaker changes.] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] I just wanted to make it clear that I do not want to
see any of these small tag agencies go under...and, to that point, it is
more important than ever that the revenue laws study the issue and
decide...or try to determine what is fair, both for the contractors and
for the counties and everybody else.  Be it the Stevens amendment or the
Speciale amendment, it needs to go to revenue laws and have a complete
review and I would ask for ya' to support the Stevens amendment.  If
it's defeated then we'll go to the second amendment and, if that one's
defeated, I...hopefully we can move it til Monday night. (Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Hopefully not.  Representative Jones, please state
your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] For point of order.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman may say his point.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, would it be in order at this time to
offer a perfecting amendment that would delete Section 4.2 from the
current amendment?
[Speaker changes.] Perfecting amendments are in order.  The question
that I have is whether or not we should look for the big reveal that
we're hoping from the Speciale amendment before we potentially take up
another thirty minutes on a perfecting amendment to this amendment if
the gentleman would indulge.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, I was just trying to get there as
quickly as possible.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Representative Jones. As am I.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Basically all I wanna say is that the numbers in
essence that are in this bill is what the license plates agencies asked
for. There's been no study to show what they need or that they need it,
which is exactly why we wanna send it to revenue laws. I understand the
desire to help these license plate agencies have more money but this is
the amount of money they get paid for an average transaction. Somebody
comin' in and payin' their taxes is as average a transaction as somebody
comin' in and renewin' their registration, somebody comin' in and
submitting their new car tag/license, transferrin' their car titles. All
of those are the average transactions that this consideration of the
amount of money set forth went into so I would ask you to support the
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] The question before the House is the passage of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Stevens to the Senate Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 305.  All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote

Ladies and gentlemen, because we have passed the 11th hour on this
issue, we are at high noon. They’re already doing the job, we’ve got to
do something. This amendment will allow them to go ahead and get paid
what was agreed upon, but it will require, we’ll put in the bill that a
study is required to come back to us in the 2014 General Assembly, with
a review of the cost for each transaction, so that that we, at that
time, can make a determination. This should have been done, we all know
that it should have been done a while back, but it takes it from that
memorandum which none of us probably saw, and puts in the bill requiring
a study. I ask that you would support this and we can move on and get

reasonable person could possibly view it that way as I’ve said before, I

This is the final UI technical correction field. I know you have heard
me say that once before that I will remind you that all through the year
that we were working on the bill that we had direct communication with
U.S department of Labor and we sent our complete draft before to the
department of Labor in the first week of November. And we received a
compliance letter note back from them last week. It was very kind and
gentle. We are in compliance basically 99.9%. But the suggestion that
the department has made we had incorporated in the senate bill with the
support of the Senate sponsor. And I will try to explain the bill to
you. The section 1 of the bill especially limits of the funds the
employment insurance fund the payment of employment benefit that would
always be in [??] .we just made it clear. Section2 is the Senator Ben
Clark’s provision that initially came from the senate and it clarifies
the description of the formula to calculate the tax rates. It makes no
actual change in the tax rate. But it’s in a clarifying language.
Section 3 especially states that government’s non-profits in [??] would
be treated as the same as other employers also especially states that
each clients stand alone allowing each employee to file a valid claim
even if the past claims had been denied. Also in Section 3  the third
part, the technical change to add the educational service agency as
required by the Federal law. Section 4 in the bill especially excludes
social security benefits, that’s way it’ been always in the past that
was certainly the intent of HB4 that we are writing it in there so that
the Federal Government can see it in written words. Section 5 especially
the waive work for search requirement for all training approved by the
division. You can’t just go in to a work program or to a training
program that is not approved by the division unless they would be
allowed. Section 4 is just leaving some obsolete phrases section, I am
sorry that was section 6. Section 7 especially states that employers
charge the clients by seasonal workers will be treated the same as other
employers. Section 8 is technical change  language just referring making
reference to the labor and economic analysis division. Section 8 is the
effective date is the same as the original [??] and I would ask for your
support.

technically required. The letter from the department of labor also
points that 70,000 persons unemployed who are on emergency federal
benefits

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may proceed, the gentleman will be mindful of the content
of his comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
So in trying to help those that would receive the Federal unemployment
benefits, I sought to run an amendment that would in fact suspend our
bill today, as of July 18th, and would therefore allow adjusted
benefits. Staff pointed out to me that once we had made as a body, made
the decision to have the bill begin on July 1 rather than Jan. 1, 2014,
which would have allowed the benefits to go to the 70,000, it was not
possible to offer an amendment. That is to say, this body and the Senate
and the Governor having decided to implement the bill on July 1, the
federal unemployment benefits cannot be offered even as adjusted to July
18th. I regret that very much, and threfore cannot support the bill. I
hope others with my concerns would do so. Thank you.

reading. The bill will be returned to the Senate.
Ladies and gentlemen, before we go to notices and announcements,  to
give you an idea of where we are, the  chair is optimistic that we will
reach agreement on the budget. Most likely some time tomorrow.
Therefore, when we adjourn we will be announcing a skeleton session on
Sunday, for the purpose of reading in the conference report to conform
to the rules about the report being available for public inspection 2
days before we take the vote on it. So the chair would anticipate the
first vote on the budget to be on Tuesday. We will also be, we will have
a session on Monday. It may be slightly earlier  than normal, we're
trying to work out the time and we will try for your planning purposes
to let you know. It would be obviously announced on Sunday, but to try
and give you a little bit more warning than that. But the chair would
anticipate no earlier than about 4:00, but perhaps 4:00 on Monday.
Again, what we're trying to do is have as much time as we can to dispose
of other bills because the chair anticipates, barring a surprise, an
unlikely surprise</p>

morning, and right after her came in today, he left. Please keep in your
prayers him and his family.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For those who can attend there will be a caucus this
afternoon at 2 o'clock, in the Finance room.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Grier Martin, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a point of Personal Privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a point of Personal
Privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Members, you all
indulged me yesterday when I told you some stories about my trip to the
UK with our wounded warriors to look at recovery through motor sports. I
didn't tell you the full story, and someone I wanted to thank for that,
because that person wasn't in the room at the time. But this effort got
started at the end of last year, when I went in and pitched Speaker
Tillis on some form of program like what was going on in the UK, in
North Carolina. He picked it up and ran with it – well, he delegated it
to his very capable staff, and immediately set up a meeting of folks
from around the state and our universities, community colleges, commerce
and throughout state government, and was really one of the driving
forces behind that. So Mr Speaker, I wanted to publicly thank you for
all your help. We've passed the first step in what I think is going to
be a continuing success. Thank you, sir. [applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a point of Personal Privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a point of Personal
Privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to invite the members and their families
to western North Carolina beginning this weekend and going into next
weekend, it'd be a good way to celebrate the end of the session for them
to come to Folkmoot USA, North Carolina's official international
festival. This Friday at 1 o'clock any of you are welcome to join us, we
have a parade of nations that march down. We have eight or nine
international folk dance teams that dance down the main street of
Waynesville to kick off the festival. This Saturday there is an
international festival day in downtown Waynesville. The nine teams will
dance all over western North Carolina, some 30 venues in the next two
weeks, but you are certainly welcome to come, and if I can help you make
arrangements or put you up at my house you're welcome to come to western
North Carolina for Folkmoot, this weekend and next.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, does that extend into Sunday?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It does, it is. It goes through this weekend and all
the way into Sunday. They have a candlelight closing on Sunday at Lake
Junaluska's Stuart Auditorium Sunday evening, weekend [RECORDING ENDS]</p>
