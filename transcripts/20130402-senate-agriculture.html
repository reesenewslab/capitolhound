This time we’ll get into our bills. Have I left out anything? Senate
Bill 384. Present Use Value Modification. Senator Tucker. Senator
Walters.
Good Morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senate Bill 384, it’s language addresses some
needs in forestry with forestry and also the counties of North Carolina
and provide the ownership of forest lands under present use value that
forestry...a consultant forester has written a management plan that
suggests that timber be cut if the weather conditions or market
conditions do not dictate that timber needs to be cut. It gives a five
year window that you can move around. It really just helps the counties
in using the present use value and gives some clarification of the law.
Also, it would not eliminate a forest owner because he had the word
investment or some other name in the title from keeping them from having
a present use value. Some counties, if the word investment comes up in
the title, it says its not used as present use as far as forestry price
goes. This bill just gives the counties some language that helps them
interpret the deal on it. I’ll be glad to answer any questions, Mr.
Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll hold that just a moment. Any questions from the committee? Senator
Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The forest management plans are required by whom,
or who are they filed with?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Kinnaird, forest management plans are
required by the county so you can participate in the present use value.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Senator Kinnaird? Any other questions? If not, this bill will
be referred to Finance or serialized to Finance if it’s approved, but we
have a favorable report from Senator Cook. All in favor let it be known
by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed. The ayes have it. Thank you, Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re welcome. Senate Bill 386. Amend Grain Dealer License and Laws.
Senator Barefoot. We have a PCS for that. Do I hear a motion we accept a
PCS? Senator Tucker makes the motion. Senator Wade seconded.
All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Jackson. This bill does three things. It amends the
existing grain dealer licensing law to increase the bond for grain
dealers from $10,000 to $100,000. It provides additional grounds for the
denial or suspension of a grain dealer license. And it prohibits
violators from evading the law by working for another grain dealer if
they’ve had their license revoked. The bonding requirement of $10,000
has not been increased the enactment of this statute in 1973. My
understanding is that inflation alone would necessitate this. Also, in
recent years, grain prices have greatly increased. The value of grain
has increased. And the potential liability to farmers when a grain
dealer becomes insolvent has also increase. In the last three years,
North Carolina

Has had several grain dealer failures leading to multimillion dollar
losses for farmers. The bond is not intended to cover all of the losses,
but meant to be a screening tool for people who don't have good credit
and, or may be fraudulent. The Small Grain Growers Association supports
this, along with the Soybean Producers Association, Farm Bureau, NC
State Grange, Southeastern Grain and Feed Dealers, which are most of the
grain dealers in the association, and it is an agency bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you Senator Barefoot. Senator Cook?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, well hold on, any questions? Senator Kinnaird?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Are you not a city boy? I, a wonderful bill, I'm
just surprised that you were the first one to put it in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can, Senator Barefoot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, until about the 1950s my family farmed the lands of
Johnston, Harnett, Bertie, and Columbus county for 200 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ever eaten a Barefoot sweet potato?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have, but we'll move on. Any other questions? Okay, if not, all those
in favor, let me know by saying aye. All opposed light the sign. The
ayes have it. Thank you Senator Barefoot. You did a great job there.
Okay, moving right along, Senate bill 387. Did we have a PCS for that?
I'll, Senator Barefoot, I believe you're on that one as well. And
they're passing out the PCS. Thank you Ernie. Do I have a motion, we
accept the PCS? Senator Bingham, glad you joined us. I have a second? I
have a second, Senator Wade. All those in favor let me know by saying
aye. All opposed light the sign. Will you accept the PCS? Senator
Barefoot, go for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill just makes technical changes to the agriculture, environment,
natural resources act when the Division of Forestry came into the
department of agriculture, as you read through the bill you'll see it
strikes out division of forest resources and replaces that with North
Carolina forest service and I ask that you support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator Kinnaid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't mean to be dominating this place, but how many pieces of paper?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a long bill, but it's an agency bill. If I may answer the
question, it's an agency bill. I have read this bill and basically what
it is doing is changing the name from the Division of Forest Resources
to the North Carolina Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture and
Consumer Services. This is mostly a technical correction. I think there
might be one or two spots where there is some new language being added.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's my point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many pieces of paper to change one name?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it's listed many times in our general statutes. Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. And just to remind Senator Kinnaird, forest ??
is a renewable resource. We keep growing more trees than we could each
day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna start charging you for commercials.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Full employment for Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's right. Okay, any, do I hear a favorable, Senator Bingham? Okay
thank you Senator Bingham. Bingham. Bingham. I'll get it right in a
minute. Any other questions on this bill? If not, all those in favor of
this bill let me know by saying aye. All opposed light the sign. The
ayes have it. Thank you Senator Barefoot. Moving right along, Senate
bill 388. Senator Rabin, ?? right of entry. Is there a PCS or anything?
Okay, this one's good to go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill is also a technical change. It restores the authority of the
commissioner of agriculture or his employees to enter upon a premises in
order, where bedding products are manufactured or held for sale in order
to enforce existing law. It requires the commissioner to obtain
administrative search warrant if consent for entry is not given. This
bill is needed because when the responsibility was transferred to the
Department of Agriculture in 2011, the authority was inadvertently left
out, leaving a gap in the department's authority to enforce the laws
that it had responsibility for.</p>
