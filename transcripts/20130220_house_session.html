The House will come to order. Members, please take your seats. Visitors
will retire from the Chamber. Members and visitors in the gallery,
please silence all cellular phones and personal electronic devices.
Prayer will be offered by Representative Larry Bell. Members and
visitors in the gallery, please stand and please remain standing for the
Pledge of Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us pray. God of our weary years. God of our silent
tears. Thou who has brought us thus far on our way. Oh, who has by thy
might, brought us into the light. Keep us in the path, we pray. That
straight and narrow path. Don't let us become drunk with the wine of the
world that we forget about thee. Help us to remain true to or God and
true to this land that we love. Oh, God, as we begin this new day of
work in this Chamber, help us not to weaken ourselves by anger or
cheapen ourselves by boasting or pretense. Help us to be real in our
work for the citizens of this State. Grant us more wisdom or knowledge,
wisdom and understanding of the numerous tasks that are before us. We
need your divine guidance and direction as we deliberate over issues and
ideas that we hope are in the best interest of all citizens. May our aim
always be less to win praise and accolades for ourselves than to further
the good and happiness of our fellow beings. Bless each family
represented here in this Chamber, grant them good health and grant them
peace and comfort as we journey through the many uncertain ventures of
this world. Help us to always be certain that you are our God, that you
are our Father, our Savior and our Lord. Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House.
Yesterday when we voted on this bill, and I know I'm half-way violating
the rules when I talk about bills that we already voted on, but when I
looked up and saw the vote I truly blamed myself that obviously I had
not given you a good explanation for what this IRC update bill did. For
all the folks who misunderstood, and I'm going to say I believe you
misunderstood what was in this bill. You chose to vote against allowing
your constituents to take the tax credits for the education expenses
that they have spent for their spouses or for their kids or whomever. We
voted against that. We also voted against the 15-year depreciation on
all lease holds for restaurants and retail improvements. Of course, all
of us, I believe, ran on jobs and commerce and expanding job
opportunities in the State of North Carolina. And unfortunately, when we
voted no on that provision, that was a disincentive for folks to invest
in these opportunities. You voted against the tax-free distribution from
IRA's to charities for individuals that are 70 and a half years old.
There were so many good things in this simple IRC update bill. Actually
I've never, in my history here, had heard any debate on the IRC update
bill. It's something...</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, it's the right thing for you to do to vote yes on
this. One tiny silver of this bill talks about earned income tax credit
and only because...again...and I say this honest and sincerely...again,
the federal government changed the rules. I ask you to vote for this
bill and, Mister Speaker, I'll be glad to try and answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House I
had planned not to say anything on the bill because it's a fait accompli
on it away, so you can listen to me or just go ahead on and take what
was said. I appreciate you Representative Howard for that explanation
but I wasn't voting against what was in the front part of the bill, I
was voting for those people who receive that earned income tax credit
and contrary to what has been said the good things in the conformance
part of this to the IRS code. If you go back and read it, what you are
doing is increasing a lot of the exemptions...really for a lot of folks,
so of those who really don't need that type of increase in exemptions.
What you're doing, is that little piece of change that these folks get
from the earned income tax credit in this state could mean the
difference between going into poverty or being able to pay a month's
rent or buying some food for the kids. The reason that the earned income
tax credit exists is for those low wage income people who just are
barely on the cusp of making it. And the amount  involved that's
attributable to the state is miniscule. You're talking about 105 to 110
million dollars overall. The average check that goes out is somewhere in
the neighborhood of 280 million..280 dollars, which is, like I say, it
helps those low wage earners to meet their obligations. Now, if you had
left this out of the bill, I think that it would have been 100 percent
voted for. If you want to do that but when you start taking from the
needy and give to the greedy, there's a problem...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...and that problem is... I will not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...gentleman will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Michaux will yield for some
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I won't
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Until after I'm through. Now, the only thing I’m
saying to you is that I voted my no vote on that bill was for those
folks who are not going to get that earned income tax credit. Sure
they're going to get the federal. You can't do anything about that and
we know that but that little extra amount...that little bitty amount
that goes to them will help them probably avoid the lines of poverty.
So, if we can't take that out...and if you want to let it expire and
when it expires..fine. We can do something about it then but don't take
it out on us right now. Let's just go ahead on...vote...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With all due respect Mr. Michaux...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady wish to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask you a question, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, since Representative Blust asked you to ask me
this and knew I respected that,  I'll answer it for you, yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Michaux.  Representative
Michaux, you've been here longer than I have and you're certainly much
more learned than I am but with all due respect, looking at this
sheet...when you've find the column that talks about earned income tax
credit...in that column it says, in parenthesis, no 2012 lull change.
Meaning that...</p>

for tax filers for last year, there is no change.  We are keeping our
word.  We are keeping our promise that everything remains whole for all
of the tax filers for last year.  Follow-up, Mr. Michaux.  I know you
remember last year when we did legislation to extend the earned income
tax credit one more year.  It was supposed to end at the end of the
year, January 1 of 13, but we extended it another year.  Again, if you
look under that column, for the year 13, we opted to conform and made a
minor adjustment, half of 1% in order to keep the revenues the same, and
to fulfill our promise, the promise that we made when we voted this bill
originally on the floor of this house, and we had the provision that it
would sunset at the end of 12.  So, we're not changing anything that we
promised to do.  To the contrary, we are allowing an additional year of
the credit to continue, and making one minor adjustment.  And I know
you're right, it's about $245.  So, that's about 10 or $12.00 less.  I
guess I'm just asking that in the form of a question, Representative
Michaux, because I know you know a lot more about this than I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, I appreciate the question, and I admit that I've
been here, not since the earth cooled, but a little bit after that.
Here again, I'm looking at everything that you've said there.  I'm
looking at the fact that the further extension that was there is no
longer there.  I think you'll agree with me on that, and that what
you're doing is really one of those situations where you still, this
year, 2012, yes.  I agree with you.  I don't have a problem with 2012.
I have a problem with 2013, is where my problem is.  And 2014 is where
my problem is.  And even in the future on it.  Be that as it may.  The
fact of the matter is still the fact that these folks who are getting it
are not going to be getting it after the 2014 year, which is on here
right now.  The only thing I'm saying is, here again, following
everything that's happened since we've been here, and looking at tax
reform, we've done tax reform bit by bit by bit.  At least three of the
pieces of tax reform have already been passed, to a degree.  So, all I'm
asking is that you let these poor people who take that little bit of
money that they get and to keep that little bit of money, and to not put
themselves on the poverty level.  I'm going to still vote for those
little people, and vote no on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.

Representative Stam.  Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question to representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michelle, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Judy, fine, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mickey.  I appreciate you.  Mr. Michaux, you do realize, that
if it was the will of this body to change the original legislation that
we passed.  You and I were here, and we voted for it.  To initially
provide the 5% credit.  And you and I voted that that provision would
sunset.  We agreed, and we all voted for that.  That it would be

was an amendment to extend it.  It was put on yesterday and like you
say, it's the wheel of the body that does it and you got the wheel and
we just a part of the body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Pierce please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, we
have realized that the right of Ecclesiastes says to everything there is
a season and a time, and we know spiritually what we've experienced the
last couple of weeks since we've been here that truly this is just
another nail in the coffin of the poor.  Those of us of the legislative
black caucus we're getting phone calls from all over the State, not only
the districts we serve but the districts many of you serve asking us
what in the world is going on in Raleigh.  I'm not sure if the areas you
come from you have poverty and poor people in your district.  I just
believe that you do knowing that that [xx] there are poor people in our
districts and they're questioning us the members of the black caucuses
if we're making these decisions to put them further and further in
poverty.  So, I would ask that when you get a chance to go back home
this weekend when you have your Town Hall meetings and travel that you
let the folks of your district know just what has been going on because
they're questioning us as if we know all that's going on.  Those are
your districts.  The people that you represent that you came to Raleigh
that said you would represent.  And I am just amazed at the war of
poverty that is going on and I think the citizens need to know that
there is a war going on to further take their benefits away that they've
had and they've enjoyed and what amazes me about it is people in poverty
and poor people come in all colors.  If it was just one ethnic group, we
could get away with it but poverty and poor people come in all colors.
The people that all of us serve and that we swore we would serve the
State of North Carolina are facing difficult times and going through
some...it's just tough out here and a lot of the legislation that we've
passed since we've been here truly has had devastation on the poor and
it put more people in poverty.  The income tax credit is one of the best
tools that we have to fight poverty.  North Carolina has the 13th
highest poverty rate in the nation and more than 1 in 4 [??] children
are living below the federal poverty level.  [??] poverty rates are even
higher definitely for Afro-Americans those that many of us serve and
many of you serve.  These credits go to fathers and mothers across the
State that have jobs and go to work each day trying to provide for their
families.  We should all be working together to find solutions to lift
more families out of poverty.  Sadly, it seems we're going in the
opposite direction.  We should keep the earned income tax credit in
place so we can lift more families out of poverty.  I urge you, first of
all, to vote no, but another point about it, Mr. Speaker, is that many
of these systems who get as Representative Howard said, 2-300 dollars or
whatever the amount, but it goes back to small businesses in our
community.  Think about the mom and pop operations.  Think about the
little stores that sometimes that little 2-300 dollars could be a make
or break situation.  Think about our local businesses.  Think about
those rural areas that are experiencing at the present time loss of
jobs.  It makes a real big difference.  Those of you who are businessmen
understand the bottom line.  It takes people with small amounts of
money, people with large amounts of money to keep a business running.
So, I would ask people to consider these things as we go forward.  I
would like to thank you all for allowing me this opportunity to stand,
as always to speak, but this is bigger, this issue is complex, it's
bigger.  The more we dig and the more we deal with it more people are
being...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Boles please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Will Representative Pierce yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Pierce will you show me the page and
line number in this Bill that eliminates the earned income tax credit in
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Your very member stood up, Representative, Howard,
and talked about how it would expire at the end of 2012, if I'm correct
and going into '13 and '14.  It would not be there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Follow up Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Does the gentleman yield to a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Is it in this Bill Representative Pierce?  You've
gone on quite a bit about that and raised a ruckus.  Is the repeal of
the earned income tax credit in this Bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The amendment that we had took it out of there.</p>

[??] Thank you Mr. Speaker for allowing me that time. I just hope as we
go forward, many of us who come from different parts of the states
represent people who are already having difficult times and it would be
hard for any of us to stand in here, all of us, and not talk about those
issues that affect the people we serve each and every day. Thank you for
allowing me this opportunity.
[Speaker]: Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[Representative Stam]: Speak on the Bill.
[Speaker]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Representative Stam]: Five things would happen that I’ve circled on
here. If a no vote prevails, people taking deductions for student loan
interest would loose 9 million dollars. Is that what you intend? People
taking income exclusions for employer provided education assistance
would loose 9 million dollars. Is that what you intend by a no vote?
Rich people don’t pay mortgage insurance premiums because they don’t
have, they have more [??] equity than that. Only people with lesser
incomes pay those premiums.
Do you really intend by voting no to cause those people 5 million
dollars?  Who gets a discharge of residence indebtedness and income
exclusion for that? Well people who get foreclosed on. Do you really
intend by a no vote to call people who have already lost their homes to
foreclosure to cost them an extra 2 million dollars? Then for those who
are concerned about the Earned Income Tax Credits since the fiscal note
says that this Bill has no effect on the earned income tax credit for
last year or this year, what are you intending to do? I urge a yes vote.
[Speaker]: Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[Representative Richardson]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would like to ask
a question.
[Speaker]: Would the lady wish to direct it to Representative Howard?
[Representative Richardson]: Yes. Thank you.
[Speaker]: Does the lady yield?
[Representative Richardson]: Representative Howard I appreciate your
hard work on this Bill and I was sitting here thinking that if this Bill
is so wonderful, except for this one piece, is it possible to pull this
one piece out and formulate it under another number?
[Representative Howard]: What piece are you…
[Representative Richardson]: The repeal of the Earned Income Tax.
[Representative Howard]: Ma’am, we’re not repealing the Earned Income
Tax Credit in this Bill.
[Representative Richardson]: Excuse me. The sunset of the Earned Income…
[Representative Howard]: Nor are we sunseting the Earned Income Tax
Credit with this IRC update. Neither, are we doing in this Bill. The
only thing this Bill is doing is trying to conform or decouple from the
Federal Code, the new laws that the Internal Revenue has just passed in
the Fiscal Cliff legislation, that we received about the 3rd or 4th day
of January and we are just trying to sort through all of those
provisions to make determinations of what we do with that.
[Representative Richardson]: May I have another question Mr. Speaker?
[Speaker]: Does the lady yield?
[Representative Howard]: Yes. Sir.
[Speaker]: The lady yields.
[Representative Richardson]: Are you telling me that this Bill in 2014
people who are eligible to receive the Earned Income Tax Credit can
still apply for that credit?
[Representative Howard]: At the Federal level? Yes ma’am.
[Representative Richardson]: No. I’m speaking of the state level.
[Representative Howard]: Ma’am I would encourage you to go back and read
the original legislation when North Carolina passed the Bill to provide
the 5 percent, it had automatically a sunset provision in that Bill.  In
this Bill that we’re debating today has absolutely nothing to do with
that original Bill that we passed in 2007 in both Chambers.
It was part of the budget Bill. There’s a total disconnect between what
we debated yesterday and where we’re sort of going again today. This
Bill does, when you get down to the line on Earned Income Tax Credit, as
I’m reading again, you have it there at your seat. There is no 2012 law
change. None.
[Representative Richardson]: Mr. Speaker, may I ask another question.
[Speaker]: If</p>

We complied with everything that the federal government just did a month
or so ago, it would cost the state budget of North Carolina over [AUDIO
DROPS], over $300 million dollars. Where's that money coming from folks?
And I also hear as Representative Howard just in the last month and a
half. But what we cannot do in this state is we cannot sit here and say
oh we want to do this and we want to do that without understanding that
these things cost money. And where you gonna get that money from? You
gonna come back to the tax payers and we're gonna raise your taxes right
now? I don't think that's gonna happen. Mr. Speaker I would recommend
the passage of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hear a lot of heated oratory sometimes passed for
debate on this floor. I've heard it said today we're doing a war on
poverty. I again would commend to you that if you really want to fight
the war on poverty call our president, call out congressmen, tell them
to quick inflating our currency and killing our poor people with rising
prices. The price of gas keeps going out of sight, it will as long as we
keep deflating the US currency. I've heard we're taking away benefits
from people who enjoy them, I've heard we're taking from the needy and
give to the greedy. I don't hear these terms ever defined. I don't know
if the greedy or the 30% who's taken this benefit by fraud or what, but
I would like to say this. There are two groups in this house. One group
unfortunately is having to make tough decisions because of a 140 years
of leadership form a monolithic party that despite decades of high
revenues back in the eighties and nineties left us in a financial funk
when we took over this chamber two years ago.
Again I have people asking me constantly, why in the world would you run
for this office especially at a time like this when the state is two and
a half billion dollars in the hole? Well it turns out once we found out
all the holes that two and a half billion was just gravy on top of the
potato. It turned out to be seven billion dollars by the time you add
the unemployment comp we owed to the feds, the shortage in the state
retirement plan, the shortage in the state health plan. Just a couple of
months ago I found out at an educators meeting that we still owe seven
hundred and something million to some school IT fund we're supported to
have been funding that wasn't funded before we got here. So I'm still
finding holes that have been dug for us before we got here.
Now we don't like everything we're having to do. I don't like raising
the suit attacks on small businesses. There's whole lot of things I
don't like that we're having to do, but somebody has got to step up, be
the adult in the room, as my friend representative Blust likes to say,
and make the hard calls. The rest of you can afford to talk to the
cameras and take your five minutes of fame or whatever. I'll say this if
my constituents knew I was willing to vote for a program with 30% fraud
in it they would run me out of my district in a heartbeat. I commend
this bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A question for Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Howard. Obviously there's
been a lot of concern about this bill. I'm a little puzzled since you
have the majority of the votes super why we've been talking about it so
long because it passed the well [??] yesterday. But I guess the question
I have is I think representative Richardson asked about taking a portion
of the bill out, a portion of it out, and you indicated if it was the
will of the body, my question to you is would you agree to an amendment
to do it? Since it appears we're trying to get everybody to vote for it
and I think you could probbaly get more votes for it if we could do
that. So would you be agreeable to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually I would not, but what I would say to you if
that amendment did pass what you would see is we would be conforming to
the 2012 and if you take it out then we would not necessarily be able to
conform to 2013, and so I would not recommend that Representative Adams,
so no ma'am I couldn't support that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you would not be - so there would be no way to
extend it then at this point. Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma'am there is a way to extend it. Someone needs
to file a bill that would simply say, it would not be anything tied to
this...</p>

Representative: …by the democratic majority in the general assembly.
Here I have a copy of house bill 51 from the 2007 the session, where a
large number of members on that side signed a bill for the EIC tax
credit, but here is house bill 1473, which was the budget bill and the
democrats, under the leadership of Representative Rucho, who is the
senior chair of appropriations, they put the sunset in there. They could
have made the EIC a permanent part of our tax code, but they chose to
put the sunset in there. It received support, not only from minority
leader Hall, but a vast number of the members over there. Folks, our
economy is sick, the medicine is bitter, but we need to make the patient
well. For two long, we have used the tax code to implement social policy
as opposed to using the tax code to promote economic growth. When the
general assembly changed hands from the democrat to republicans, there
was a change in the philosophy of how we solve problems in this state.
We do not believe that government is a benevolent father doling out
money to its citizens. We believe in individual responsibility and we
are convinced that people will provide for themselves and their families
if given an opportunity to manage their resources. It has been said, and
rightly so, that a rising tide lifts all boats. Our goal is to get our
economy moving and growing so that, not only do our boats arise
together, but we all reach the safe harbor safely. Working families of
NC are not alone and the republicans have not abandoned the small people
of this state. We have a graduated tax system in NC that is based upon
your ability to pay. Remember that the citizens who received the EIC tax
credit, filed their taxes and they owe the state zero tax dollars, or
very little money at all. We have in place today a tax system that
recognizes that low income workers and their families deserve special
help. Our tax system is designed to help them out. Even without the EIC
tax credit, this will not place an additional burden on low income
families because they will basically pay zero dollars in income taxes.
The workers are filing their taxes and paying what they owe, which is
very little. As legislators, I think we need to take the legislative
Hippocratic oath, which says, do no harm. Folks, this is a good bill and
it does not harm to the citizens of NC. I urge you to vote yes.
Speaker: The question before the house is the passage of the house
committee substitute to house bill 82 on its third reading. All in favor
will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote: 80 having voted in
the affirmative, 36 in the negative. House committee substitute to house
bill 82 has passed its third reading and will be sent to the senate.
House bill 77, the clerk will read. Oh, if the clerk will yield for a
moment. Ladies and gentleman we had a lengthy debate. I see that the
doctor and the nurse of the day in the chamber would like to welcome Dr.
Ward Adcock from Gastonia and nurse Hartley from Carrey. Thank you for
being here today and for your service. [clapping[ The clerk will read.
Clerk: House bill 77, a bill entitled an act to delete a revision of $50
payment to [xx] board examiners to have that has not been paid since the
1970’s and to clarify a provision to expenses of that board as
recommended by the general statute commission. NC general assembly
enacts.
Speaker: Representative Bluss is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house. We had a
good vote on this yesterday. I hope that you will vote for the bill
again today. We did carry it over for third reading to answer a question
that was posed to whether the bill affects volunteers that help the law
examiners grade these tests. The bill does not affect the volunteers. I
am told by the board that they do pay an honorium to the volunteers of
$400 for helping out. They do have also some volunteers that are law
professors, lawyers and  judges to help draft a questions for the bar
exam.</p>

Representative Horn, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I have bad
news for you. I have tried to find a Churchill quote to begin my
presentation and I have failed. But I have good news for you.
We have a great bill and a great opportunity for you right now to
support a decision by North Carolina's attorney general, support a
decision by the sheriff's association and law enforcement across this
state and support people of North Carolina fight one of the most
insidious drug issues we've got. Methamphetamine.
There's pictures on your desk of what that terrible stuff does. It's a
one and done. Every county in this state has a meth problem. Every
county and it's growing like crazy. So here is an opportunity to begin
to stick a finger in a dike. A finger into the hole in the dike. So I
ask you to support this bill that will not only create a new offense for
those that make methamphetamine in the presence of a child or a elderly
or a disabled person but will also raise the bar for those that have
been convicted for making methamphetamine and have shown that they are
going to do it again by possessing the one and only ingredient you have
to have to make methamphetamine and that is pseudoephedrine.
The only ingredient you have to have to make pseudoephedrine.
I think the odds are pretty good that if you've been convicted meth
cooker and you're found with pseudoephedrine on you, odds are pretty
good you're going to be making more meth.
So this bill does not take away anything from anyone from the
standpoint, doesn't prohibit you from buying anything legally within
legal limits. It just sends a clear message to meth cookers and a clear
message to our citizens that we're going to do the best we can to
protect you. We can do better than this but this is a good start.
I urge you to pass this bill.

Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, you've
heard representative Horn. He is dedicated to this cause and I honor his
dedication. He has worked so hard on this.
I want you to know that those of us who have watched the scourge of
drugs come through North Carolina since back in the sixties, have never
seen a drug like methamphetamine. It is the single most destructive drug
that we know of. And it is so simple to make. That is what really makes
it so difficult to deal with. If you think about opium and all those
terrible drugs that are shipped across the ocean, they're fairly simple
to put together but not nearly as simple as methamphetamine. Go to the
drug store, stop in the aisle at the local Walmart, pick up a few
things, step back to the back of the building and mix</p>

Bottle in either a bomb goes off or another  group of people are using
drugs.  This is a drug that once it’s taken, you’re hooked. It’s almost
impossible to get away from it. Look at those pictures on your desk.
Most of those pictures were about 2 and 3 years apart. The person on the
left was arrested for something at one point and had their picture
taken. The person on the right is the same person after continued
destructive use of methamphetamine. The only questionable part of this
bill is the part that makes it a violation for someone who has been
convicted if making methamphetamine who has in their possession the
ingredient pseudoephedrine ?? If you are worried about a person that
uses that as a cold medicine not being able to get it, it does not
affect that in any way. We assure you they can use that if they want to.
There are several other medication that will work as well. This only
seeks to get at the person that is manufacturing this and who’s doing
great destruction to our society. I urge your support of the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Jones, state your purpose [Speaker
Changes] to debate the bill [Speaker Changes] gentleman is recognized to
debate the bill [Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Just very
briefly, these drugs are poisoning our young people and Representative
Horn, this is a little bit light hearted but I looked up just to see if
there is a Churchill quote that has to do with drugs and there is one
that has to do with poison. Nancy Aster said to Winston Churchill, sir
if you were my husband, I would give you poison. And Churchill’s
response was, Ma’am if I were your husband I would take it. I just
wanted to say that is a lighted hearted thing and this is not a light
hearted issue but if that helps us to remember that these drugs really
are poisoning our young people.  And I think we as the general assembly
need to take what actions that we do to try to get rid of this poison in
North Carolina. So ladies and gentlemen I commend this bill too.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Earl, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] speak on the bill [Speaker Changes] Lady is recognized
to peak on the bill. [Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker and members, I had
some questions and concerns about this bill in committee. And I’m going
to you that I’m going to vote for it because I know that if I vote
against it then there will be a sound byte that I support manufacturing
meth. And I don’t want to hear that in my next election.  But the thing
that concerns me is the part about possessing a cold medication if in
fact you’ve ever been convicted of manufacturing, which means that there
is no getting beyond , straightening up your life or doing any of that.
To me it equates to if youever get caught driving under the influence,
you should never ever be caught with alcohol again. I mean it’s the same
thing. It’s addictive also And so is smoking and some of the other ugly
things we do. But I am going to vote for it even though I still have a
question and I still think that it goes a little bit too far with people
being, I guess, charged with a felony if they have possession of a legal
cold medication based on the fact of something that happened in their
previous; and I am not saying and I certainly don’t think that everyone
that has manufactured meth will alwaysgo back to manufacturing. I don’t
necessarily think that’s the truth. Thank you. [Speaker Changes] for the
discussion, for the debate. If not the question before the house is the
passage of house bill 29 on its 2nd reading. All in favor vote Aye. All
opposed, vote No. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk ?? machine
record the vote. 116 having voted the affirmative and 1 in the negative.
