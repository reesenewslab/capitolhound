Senate will come to order. Sergeant Arms will close the doors. Members
go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will please silence
all electronic devices. Leading the senate in prayer is Doctor Michael
Whitsan of Indian Trail. Doctor Whitsan is a guest of Senator Tucker.
All members and guests in the gallery will please stand. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Let us pray. Father, as we gather here this evening, many in our
nation are reeling from a senseless attack. We ask that you comfort the
bereaved and heal the wounded of their wounds, both physical and
emotional. For those who initiated this mindless horror, we pray that
justice will reign. Please take this tragic event and use it to cause us
to become more dependent on you than ever before. When other are
illogical and unreasonable or self centered, help us to love them any
way. When we do good and others question our motives, empower us to do
good anyway. In the midst of our success, false friends rise and as a
result our true enemies are exposed, may we succeed anyway. When our
good may be forgotten tomorrow, may we do good anyway. When our honesty
and frankness make us vulnerable, strengthen us to be honest and frank
anyway. When the biggest men and women with the biggest ideas are shot
down by the smallest of minds, may we think big anyway. When what we
spent many years building crumbles over night, may we build anyway. When
those we help respond with attack, may we help people anyway. When we're
kicked in the teeth for giving the world our best, give us the
determination to give the world the best we have anyway. For in so
doing, we become like you and how you treat us. In Jesus name, Amen.

public bill second reading Senate bill 358, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 358, &quot;Guaranteed Asset Protection Waivers&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this proposed
legislation would seek to establish a statutory framework for the
offering of a guaranteed asset protection waiver, or GAP waiver, in
North Carolina. A GAP waiver's offered to a borrower when a person is
financing the purchase of a car. As soon as the borrower drives off the
dealer's lot, the new car value plummets. Because of this de-evaluation,
the amount the borrower owes exceeds the amount the vehicle is worth. If
the borrower destroys the vehicle at that time, they will owe more than
the amount covered by the primary insurance proceeds. The additional
amount owed would come out of the borrower's pocket unless the person
has a GAP waiver. If a GAP waiver was purchased, the lender would waive
the amount owed in excess of what the borrower's primary insurance paid.
I would appreciate your support, and I do have an amendment I'd like to
send forward, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, do the members have copies of the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They do, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to send forth rule 29 on this particular bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you can send forward the rule.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Murry move to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this amendment was
brought up to me by staff and also Senator Brown brought this up in
committee. There are currently GAP waivers in place throughout the state
of North Carolina. This amendment would actually set a date certain,
October 1st of 2013, and all GAP waivers that were purchased after that
date this law would apply to. Anything that had been purchased prior
would not be affected by this law. So I would appreciate your support on
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

none, the question before the Senate is the passage of amendment 1, all

week, and we thank you for being here with us. [Applause] Do we have any
notices or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the events of today have to be put before us, the events up in
Boston, I guess that old soldiers that never really do fade away, were
involved against terrorism and that terrorism is all around us and in
many forms. I think we have to bear that in mind as we go through our
routines and focus on some of those issues that will help to stop it.
These people, regardless of their origin or their reason for doing
things, aren't really misguided, they are just guided in the wrong
direction by something, we have to figure out what it is, but we surely
cannot talk to the problem, we cannot be complacent about the problem,
we have to face the problem and make up our minds that we darn well are
going to do something about it so that it doesn't happen in North
Carolina. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Senator Rabin, for those comments, and I would simply remind us
all of the power of prayer and definitely appreciate the prayer from Dr.
Woodson today. As we talk about prayer, everyone should have received a
notice on your desk with Representative Garland Pierce, who is chair of
the legislative black caucus, he has asked me to please announce this
today, that is, many of us remember the work of our former colleague the
late Representative William Wainwright. In the morning there will be a
prayer breakfast, a tribute in his honor, and we remember a person who
made great contributions as the Speaker Pro Tempore, as well as the
Senate Minority Leader, so I do remind you that announcement is on your
desk. And I encourage us all to continue to pray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnear, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A point of personal privilege, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnear, you do have the floor for a point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The students who were introduced earlier created a project
that created a difference in their classroom, their school, even perhaps
the county, and we hope beyond the county. Helen, [?? names], were
following a local news story about how the Orange County landfill was
closing. Since no new site had been located in the county, it will now
be transported to another county. They knew that that transferring would
have a detrimental impact on the environment, so they asked how they
could reduce waste going into the landfill in their own setting. They
realized their lunch in their classroom and in the lunchroom generated
much waste, and they asked how they could reduce their own amount going
into the landfill, and make a contribution. They created a collection of
the liquids from the lunches and found it apparently accounted
for...[END]</p>

Amazing amount going into the trash. We convince the rest of the school
to participate and it was very successful. Keeping a great deal out of
the landfill. It is now included in combustible trays. These children
were thinking very creatively of how to solve a problem. And they
entered into the Semen's sustainability competition and we have just
found out they have been first in the state for the we change the world
competition from Semen's. We are very proud of the work that they do and
all of our other students. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other notices or
announcements?  Any further business to come for the senate? If not the
