  Let&#39;s go ahead and get started. Please take your seats. I want to
apologize for not having this meeting last week. Am I on now? Okay. All
right. I wanna apologize for not having this meeting last week. We had
some scheduling conflicts we just couldn&#39;t, couldn’t deal with. We
have two sergeant in arms today. Steve McKaig and Giles Jeffreys. We
appreciate you being here. We have one page, Rashan Jones, sponsored,
from Enfield, and sponsored by Senator Bryant. We&#39;re glad to have
you here today. This is gonna be another just informational meeting, the
second one we&#39;ve had. We have two presenters, Catherine Moga Bryant
and Will Collins. We&#39;ve got to be out of here by 12:50 because
there&#39;s a finance meeting at one, so Catherine would you come please
and take about 20 minutes, and we&#39;ll have five minutes for
questions, and then we&#39;ll have Will come up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon mister chair and members. My name is Catherine Moga
Bryant. I am the director of governance and strategic planning for the
division of workforce solutions in the Department of Commerce, and today
I&#39;ll just be providing a brief overview of the NC Works Commission.
But before I get into the role of the NC works commission, I just want
to start off with the definition of workforce development. And the
definition is that they are the programs, systems, and networks that are
primarily designed to enable individuals to succeed in the workplace by
providing skills assessment, skills development, training, and
employment services, and it&#39;s also the program services and networks
and systems that help businesses obtain a skilled workforce by providing
recruitment assistance, customized training or structured work based
learning opportunities. I know a couple weeks ago you saw this chart
from the program evaluation division, and this is what our workforce
system looked like in 2011, and as you can see and as you saw a couple
of weeks ago, it&#39;s complicated. There&#39;s lots of different
programs and funding streams, agencies that are involved, and it
includes many different ways that you can access our system. But as a
result of that report, there was legislation passed to streamline and
reinforce our workforce system. And as you heard from the program
evaluation division a couple weeks ago, that we have fully implemented
that legislation and we have made significant changes to our workforce
system to truly improve it and accomplishing the task that were laid out
in the legislation. The governor has further strengthened our workforce
system with the announcement of NC works of April of last year. This
announcement was made at the caterpillar facility and you can see on the
picture here a nice big caterpillar machine in the background. And it
was made at the caterpillar facility because the chair of the NC works
commission is, works at caterpillar, and also in attendance was
President Scott Rolls from the community college system as well as
Secretary Decker from the Department of Commerce. And at this event, he
announced that workforce programs would work under one name. We really
wanna simplify our system for customers, make it easy to find services,
and provide these services in a cohesive manner, and so that name for
our workforce system is NC works, and all of our programs will fall
under that one name. He also announced that the system would strengthen
its response to businesses to ensure that we&#39;re listening to those
businesses and that our system is meeting the needs of the businesses.
We hear a lot about the skills gap, and one of the strategies to address
the skills gap is to understand what it is businesses need and ensure
that we are training people for the needs of our businesses. He
announced that we would scan the needs of our businesses, and I&#39;m
sure you&#39;ve heard about the 1,100 Initiative, and Will Collins will
speak on that in a few minutes. But this was one strategy to ensure that
we heard businesses, that we&#39;re listening to them and know what
their needs are. We&#39;re gonna use data to make the best decisions and
then to measure our results, and then he charged the NC Works Commission
to oversee this more integrated, more comprehensive, and collaborative
system. So in sort, NC Works is North Carolina&#39;s strategy to ensure
that we have the best workforce in the country. It&#39;s about alignment
and coordination of workforce programs and the Department of Commerce,
the community college system and the Department of Public Instruction.
It&#39;s also a customer focused system, which I think is very different
from a programatic focused system. We&#39;re focused on the customer and
how we can help

  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/A31SZ4NT99NKDL">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=3TLFH2L6Y8NKYFJWRGBIKXMH1P92T8&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>
  
  <p id="05:00">
  ...both businesses and individuals get the skills that they need and the
businesses get the talent that they need, so that we are responsive to
the needs of our economy, and as a system that prepares workers to
succeed in the North Carolina economy, and continuously improve our
skills. In this day and age with new technologies and changes in the
economy we need to constantly be improving our skills and upgrading.
So today I&#39;d like to say that this is what our workforce system
looks like, it&#39;s a set of interlocking gears that are working
together under the oversight of the NC Works Commission to engage,
recruit, access, develop and connect talent to jobs. And the NC Works
Commission is the appropriate entity to oversee this system. The
membership of the commission is led by business and industry. A majority
of its members come from the private sector, as well as the chair of the
commission. It also has the leaders of the state agencies with workforce
development programs, including the Department of Commerce, the
community college system, the Department of Public Instruction, Health
and Human Services Administration and the Department of labor. And the
remaining seats are filled by representatives of labor, education and
community-based organizations.
The mission of the NC Works Commission is to ensure that North Carolina
has an innovate, relevant, effective and efficient workforce development
system that develops adaptable, work-ready, skilled talent to meet the
current and future needs of workers and businesses, to achieve and
sustain economic prosperity. And that mission was developed as part of a
strategic planning process, which I&#39;m happy to say that plan was
approved just this past Monday. And this plan was a comprehensive
strategic plan. It&#39;s the first time that the state has had one
comprehensive plan to guide the workforce system. And the NC Works
Commission identified four goals to help create and transform our
workforce system.
The first goal was to create an integrated, customer centered and
seamless workforce system. A system that&#39;s easy for people to
access, to get the skills that they need, and for businesses to access
to get the talent that they need.
The second goal was to create a workforce system that is responsive to
the changing needs of the economy. We can&#39;t just relax and say that
we&#39;ve got a good system today, but we have to be constantly
improving and updating our system to make sure that it&#39;s keeping up
with our economy.
The third goal is to prepare workers to succeed in the North Carolina
economy and continuously improve their skills. And then the last goal is
about using data to drive strategies, that we&#39;re making data-based
decisions, and to ensure accountability. And when the commission
developed this plan it also developed a strategic action plan, which
defines how the state will achieve those goals and objectives.
So it didn&#39;t just set out the goals and objectives, but the specific
action steps to achieve these goals. And these action steps fall into
four key categories. The first one is system alignment and
transformation. And these are strategies that are focused truly on
transforming our state&#39;s workforce system to make it the best in the
country.
The second category is to strengthen customer service, really focusing
on providing information about all of our services instead of
information just program by program. But when somebody comes into one of
our offices or one of our business services representatives talks to a
business, that they hear not just about that one program but they hear
about the whole range of services that our state can offer to help
people.
The third category is career pathways, and these are purposeful plans
for education and training that lead to knowledge and skill acquisition
and most importantly, successful careers. And these plans are going to
be developed by engaged employers to be sure that we are training to
meet the needs of our businesses. And these pathways, the development of
these pathways is truly a team approach. Again, it&#39;s led by engaged
employers and it needs to include our workforce programs in the
Department of Commerce, the community college system, public
instruction, to make sure that we are providing a comprehensive set of
services.
The final category is accountability, and the commission is going to
measure not only the success of these specific strategies, but it&#39;s
going to set goals for each of our programs, it&#39;s going to review
the performance, and it&#39;s going to provide information on the
success of our programs.
And in regards to accountability, the commission has already started
down this path. Over the past two years, it has worked to develop
performance measures. And just this past January it released a report on
performance measures for North Carolina&#39;s workforce development.

  <p id="10:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the commission will continue to work, improve and
expand upon these performance measures to make sure that we&#39;re
tracking how our programs are doing. But for each program in the state,
there is information available on employment, wages, and transition into
higher education or other workforce development programs. And on this
slide you can see on the right, an example of the chart that is
available for each program in North Carolina&#39;s workforce system.
That&#39;s all I have Mr. Chair, and I&#39;d be happy  to take questions
at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Okay, any questions? Senator Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ordinarily I&#39;m not called on that quickly. Thank
you very much for your presentation ma&#39;am, I notice that you want to
have this situation streamlined and appreciate the efficiencies there,
but I see six different state agencies all working. Is there any idea
about streamlining that or reducing some of the six to make things a
little more seamless? Any ideas there ma&#39;am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Each of the agencies that provide workforce services
have a unique role within the system. Public instruction obviously works
in the K-12 arena, community colleges in the community college arena,
universities have a separate role, and our programs really are focused
in the Department of Commerce, are focused on kind of that recruitment
and screening assessment. We&#39;ve got career centers across the state
and again, Mr. Collins will speak more directly to the commerce
programs. But each of our agencies have a unique role, and NCWorks has
been identified as the best strategy for ensuring that all these
programs with all their unique roles are working together in a more
streamlined and efficient way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, and just a quick question. In
terms of the membership, I saw-I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s one
representative from each of these agencies. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. It is the leader of each of those
agencies, so the Secretary of Commerce, the President of Community
College System.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair. I see the university system is
not in here, is there a reason?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The university system is not currently a member of the
NCWorks Commission. We are actually working to resolve that this year.
The membership is laid out in legislation and we&#39;ll be working with
this body to try and update that membership.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Krawiec.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for  your
presentation. I know that you&#39;re trying to get all the pieces to fit
together. A concern that I have, I visited with several large employers
in my district, and particularly Yadkin County. There are a couple of
big firms there looking to expand, and the unemployment in that
particular county, which is a wonderful problem to have, is very low.
One of the plants is actually bringing in vans from Virginia each day
because they can&#39;t get enough of their workforce. Is there a plan to
sort of communicate out to the field where those job openings are?
Because they&#39;re having a hard time recruiting. And they&#39;re good
paying jobs. It&#39;s a good problem for my district, but I&#39;m
concerned that they&#39;re not going to move forward with their
expansion because of that concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that a more aligned system with all of our
partners working together would help share that information. A key part
of the NCWorks Commissions Plan is to really connect with businesses on
a more regular basis and then to share that information among programs
so that perhaps there&#39;s not as many people in Yadkin County, but
maybe in the next county over there are. And if our programs are working
together more systematically, and have the tools and resources in order
to share that information, I believe that we can help start to address
some of those programs-some of those issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions? Senator ??, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You thought you&#39;d escaped didn&#39;t you? Go back
to the first question in the chart that ??. To me when you say system,
we&#39;re talking about something that is interrelated and working
together. And when I look at the chart, all I see is stovepipe. Is there
any way, and I understand now why the UNC system only appears on one of
your charts, it&#39;s the gear chart. First, a high assurance that the
UNC system will be part of the net and secondly, looking at what ways to
really make this a system rather than a series of stovepipes, where
there&#39;s no real guarantee of connectivity.

  <p id="15:00">
  Be happening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, if you could focus on the gear chart, this is where we&#39;re
moving to, and, and the, everybody likes to call it the spaghetti chart
with all the lines. I believe that was a more accurate representation of
our system four years ago, and we&#39;ve really made some strides to
make this is a comprehensive system that does work together, and let me
give you an example of how that works through our, a program that we did
with GE Aviation up in West Jefferson. GE Aviation announced a $100
million expansion in West Jefferson and they needed some employees to
work in their new facility. And our career centers, our NC Works career
centers worked collaboratively with our community college system to
recruit, assess, screen, and then send folks to training to really meet
the needs of that business. So it&#39;s a perfect example of each of
these different gears, each of these different parts of our system
working together to not only meet the employment needs of a company, but
to help people in that community get good paying jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you, what I&#39;m hoping I guess is that we&#39;re working
toward a system that works like that rather than the chart that I see.
Is that what I heard. Okay. The MOE&#39;s, I&#39;m not. I pushed the
wrong push. I&#39;m not sure that they&#39;re the right MOEs. We have to
see that over time. What I&#39;m concerned within there is I did some
other homework and when you use the word cohort in that second line
where it says percentage of individuals in the cohort, I&#39;m assuming
you&#39;re referring to the study that commerce put out that talks to
the workforce development also. And when I read through that, what I
found out was there are about seven or eight populations excluded
because they couldn&#39;t be included. Therefore I wonder if that cohort
is a representative sample and if we&#39;re gonna do MOEs we have to
have a more representative example in there and work towards that so we
know we had that broader scope. No part timers, no military, no one
seeking work. If they&#39;re not seeking work, they&#39;re not in it.
Only in organizations covered by the unemployment organizations. Somehow
we have to resolve and get a much broader sample base out of all of
that, so we know that what we measure is everything, closer to a
representative sample of the state than it is of just a select group
because we couldn&#39;t get the other data, because I&#39;m sure we can
get the data. It&#39;s just a case of working on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the, for the performance measures we did track the employment and
wages using the information that&#39;s submitted to the division of
employment security on, for their unemployment insurance filings, and so
it does include every business and every employer, every individual who
is employed by a business who files for, participates in the
unemployment insurance system. It, you&#39;re right, it does not include
the federal government at this time, but we are working on some
agreements to include military, federal government, as well as getting
some information from other states to better track individuals that are
served through our system. So hopefully in the next year, we will have
some, some good updates to this, to this report and be able to track
more members that, that participate in our system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you so much. Next, we have Will Collins, assistant Secretary
Department of Commerce, and they sent out a press release yesterday
which announced a groundbreaking strategic plan so that now for the
first time, North Carolina has a comprehensive plan that sets the
direction of the entire workforce system, and that&#39;s pretty exciting
news. So, please share with us, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Thank you first of all, cochairs and members for the
opportunity to share with you what we&#39;re doing with workforce now,
because it is new and exciting and it&#39;s different and I hope that
you will get something from the presentation I&#39;m about to share with
you. First of all, I&#39;d like to kind of introduce myself since
I&#39;ve not had a chance to meet everyone, and just to share that
I&#39;ve been on board now for 15 months as the assistant secretary of
commerce responsible for workforce, but I come at this in a little bit
different manner. I actually come out of a private sector, so I&#39;ve
been in private business in advanced manufacturing for the past 40
years, and I&#39;ve also been in human resources for all of those 40
years as well. So I&#39;ve always been on the customer side of business
for the past 40 years. Now we&#39;re on the service side of business, so
it&#39;s

  <p id="20:00">
  Taking a little bit different look and I understand the needs of
business for the most part, and we’re trying to address exactly what
companies need. I think we’ve made major improvements with our
professionalism, our enthusiasm, our excitement and commitment from our
workforce team members across the state, and that’s something that we
are certainly committed to do. We’re also looking at improving
efficiencies and customer service across the state, and I hope you’ll
find that we are certainly moving in that direction. You just had an
opportunity to see Catherine’s chart and we wanna highlight here
commerce because commerce is one of the integral leaders here, but I
just want to share with you that we are part of a team. This is
certainly a massive team effort, takes into account all of our teamwork
with the community colleges, with the department of public instruction,
with all of our workforce board of members and all of their staff, team
members. So we’re doing this as a collaborative effort. It’s not, no one
group can be successful without the others. So we are making these
changes as a collaborative effort. Our mission is pretty simple. The
chart looks complicated, but our mission is actually pretty simple, and
that is we want to provide first class service and resources to the
people and to the businesses of the state of North Carolina, and that’s
what we’re trying to do. So it looks complicated, but it’s actually not
very complicated. We’re trying to, trying to make it simpler so that we
can manage it better. One thing we do is we do this with two different
areas of focus and activities. We connect talent to jobs, and we do that
through employer engagement, and I’m gonna touch on each one of these in
a little more detail further on. What we do with employment, employer
engagement and with talent identification for our job seekers, and help
them understand where they can find opportunities and they can grow in
their careers. And again, we do this through improved customer service
and improvement in all of our efficiencies across the state. Now you’re
gonna see something here that’s new, and it’s called the NC works
promise, and its something that we are going to launch and roll out in
the very near future, and it is something that says our pledge is to
companies both new and existing and growing that we’re gonna recruit,
assess, and train our citizens to meet and exceed their workforce needs,
and that’s a commitment we wanna make. We’re already doing this, but
we’ve just not labeled it as a, as a promise before. So we’re gonna be
doing that, and it’s something that’s new and different, and it’s gonna
show our commitment to businesses and job seekers across the state, and
we do that, again, with commitment and support from all of the different
groups that we work with. As we mentioned, employer engagement is a
major part of how we are successful in the commitment that we make. We
meet with employers on a regular basis, both current and for future
employers as they come into economic development and express an interest
in growing or building in the state of North Carolina. We understand
their needs because we ask them, we let them tell us what they need to
do. We are the first line of support in doing all this. We provide labor
market information, so we use our data so that we can understand where
we wanna go and where we’ve been so that we’ll know how to get where
we’re going. We want to identify and develop our pipeline of talent. We
also want to structure work based learning, and I’m gonna touch on that
in just another minute here, but work based learning is a real key
ingredient, especially for the major employers across the state. So the
bottom line is we’re gonna connect talent to jobs. I wanna take a second
and share with you an initiative that we launched back in the summer,
and effective September 22, we launched what we called the 1100 Program.
And that’s where we made a commitment that we were gonna meet with ten
businesses in every one of our 100 counties, and we were gonna do all of
this within 100 days. Well I’m very proud to tell you we accomplished
that goal. We actually met with 1,107 companies across the state, so we
met with at least ten businesses in every one of our 100 counties. We
talked with them. We said, please tell us what are we doing right so we
can share best practices across the state, so that some things that
work, something that is working in the mountains may be able to work in
the coast or the piedmont. So we found out what is interesting, what is
of interest to them. But we also asked them, what are we doing wrong?
What do we need to do better? What keeps you up at night? Tell us how we
can make improvements. So they’ve done that, and they were very excited
to share with us their ideas, recommendations, exactly where they stand
on these issues. So we feel it was very successful. We’re gathering all
that data, and then we’re gonna share that data with the appropriate
people so that we make changes in our programs. So that’s very exciting
that we’ve got new data. We’ve also been told this was one of the
biggest

  <p id="25:00">
  And this was one of the largest surveys of this nature ever in the
history of the nation, not just North Carolina. So something that we did
that was new and different, we went out and sought advice and ideas and
recommendations that had never been done before and was very successful.
The reason that it was successful is because we did it collaboratively.
The partners in this were the community college system, DPI, Economic
Development, workforce boards, career centers, that’s the first time
that these groups came together with a common cause and they went out
and met with companies. First time they ever done that, so what they’ve
done since then is they have assured these companies we’re gonna
continue these types of efforts going forward, so it’s a very exciting
initiative that we launched. We also want to make sure that we do
everything we can to support companies with job postings and job fairs,
things of that nature. We do their screening and their assessments. We
refer candidates to training programs so that it improves their
opportunities to advance their careers. I’ll tell you a little bit more
about work-based learning in that it applies to such things as on the
job training, internships, coops and particularly the apprenticeship
programs. Apprenticeship’s been getting a lot of attention, a lot of
attention nationally and  we’re on the forefront of these programs and
we are recognized nationally as having one of the better apprenticeship
programs around, so we’re very excited about what we’re doing with
apprenticeship in particular. I’ll share with you one more point and
that is we cannot just have a cookie cutter type of program. One size
does not fit all. That’s why we go to companies, instead of us tilling
them what we’re gonna do for them we ask them what can we do to support
you. You tell us what you need. We’ll build customized training programs
across community colleges. We’ll build different curriculums. We’ll do
these things with workforce and we’ll do it with commitment and make
sure that you’re successful. We know that companies drive the economy,
so if we can satisfy their needs and address their, such things as the
skill gap and things of that nature, we’re gonna be successful across
the state. So that’s what we’re doing and we’re addressing exactly what
the company needs. Well, we also do this with talent identification with
our job seekers. We meet with these job seekers in our career centers.
We talk about what opportunities are out there. How do you get a job?
How do you increase your skills? How do you take advantage of training
programs that are available? How do you get ready to move into something
that’s better for your career? We assess their skills, we provide
information on how to man jobs, we help them plan their careers. We
don’t just sit down and we don’t just given them a name and say go find
this job and go apply here, we sit down and say this is how you do it.
This is how you interview. This is how you make yourself more available,
more interesting for the potential employers. So we develop those
skills. We tell them what type of work-based learning is available. So I
just want you to know that we do all this at a local basis. This isn’t
something that happens out of Raleigh. This happens out on the ground.
It happens in all of our career centers across the state. In addition to
this I’ll also take a minute to just say we have 92 veterans that are in
the job to help. Their job every day is to do nothing but help veteran
find jobs and they’re located in our career centers all across the state
of North Carolina and they’re passionate about this and they’re excited
about what they can do to help veterans find jobs. So that’s one thing
that’s not very well known. We don’t publicize it enough and we need to
get that word out too, so we do that every day. I’ll share with you,
take a look at this map. You’ll see that we have about 70 certified
career centers across the state right now and you’ll see that there are
some in almost every community. We’re changing the mindset. If you don’t
take anything away from what I’m sharing with you today, there’s a
message I want you to deliver to your constituents and to your fellow
lawmakers and that is we no longer have unemployment offices, we have NC
Works career centers. That’s what they are. They help people find jobs,
help people make improvements in their careers. It’s no longer the
unemployment office, so get that message out. We need to deliver that so
that people understand we’re making progress and we’re doing things
different than we’ve ever done it before. We’re also consolidating
offices. We’re making changes and improvements in efficiency to bring
offices together. Instead of maybe having two in a community we may just
need one and we can improve services. So we’re doing that and we’re
looking at many different ways to make improvements there. We also have
an NC

  here to help you. We&#39;re excited about it. So we got a lot of good
things going on. So with that, I&#39;ll just close out and I&#39;ll be
glad to take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you so much. The first question is from Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;re also from the government and we&#39;re here to help you alsol,
okay? First question, I understand the concept but how do we know
we&#39;re there or we&#39;re getting there? What&#39;s our measures of
effectiveness on the NCWorks?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part of the measurements that we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re measuring how
many applicants we get through NCWorks and our website, we&#39;re also
recording information about the number of candidates that we help every
day in our career centers. So we&#39;re trying to determine exactly how
effective that is. That&#39;s not been done historically so that&#39;s
something new that we&#39;re tracking to understand where were going.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
More tied to your goals, though, in your press release today there were
I think four goals and your MOE&#39;s are going to be tied to your
goals, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, that is part of our strategic plan that&#39;s just been
approved by the commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you provide the committee with those as soon as you get them
drafted out, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I will certainly do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And a follow-up, if I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m looking at your career centers and by count, and I&#39;ve only
got one eye, I came out with 58, there might be more, there might be
less.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The issues that I have, though, or that I&#39;d like to get comment on
is I just read where there&#39;s eight prosperity zones by the economic
development guys and we&#39;re supposed to be working together on this,
23 workforce development board centers of excellence, or whatever, and
every time I turn around there&#39;s another set of regions and tiers
and stuff. Is there some way that we could get an economy of scale by
putting these together and getting them to actually co-locate and work
together?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, and I would like to point out your numbers in that. I said
that we are working, we have applications that have just recently been
approved for the career centers and it is a certification process. This
is not just a checklist, there&#39;s a lot that goes in to being a
certified career center. So we have more offices than you see on the
chart but these are just the ones that are certified to date.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me follow, it&#39;s not the number that&#39;s disturbing, it&#39;s
whether or not they&#39;re working with the prosperity zone guys and the
workforce development board people and all of that rather than just
going off in 17 directions. Everybody doing good, I&#39;m not saying
they&#39;re not trying to do good, but it might be that we could get
some economy by bringing the force together and focusing it. And then
the third question, really, is I&#39;m obviously glad you&#39;re taking
care of the military like you said but when I looked at the same map I
see that Cumberland County and Harnett County, closest to Fort Bragg
don&#39;t have any dots.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well that&#39;s because they&#39;re not certified at this time, so
they&#39;re going through a certification process and it&#39;s a very
elaborate process that has to be, they have to pass certain criteria
before they earn the dot on the map. So they will become a certified
center, they have applied for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I further assume that the folks that are doing the veterans work are
working with, like FTCC I know happens to have a really good program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Bragg has a good program, I haven&#39;t been to the other ones, that
they coordinate closely with those as they try to find these jobs and
not work in opposite directions. It&#39;s sort of back to that idea
synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And all that, we are working extensively with veterans. We actually have
some new initiatives that we&#39;ll be rolling out very shortly that
shows that commitment as well. We are, actually the governor&#39;s
attending an event tomorrow at Camp Lejeune to announce getting
employers more excited about bringing veterans into their corporations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Elaborate a little bit more, if you will, on his question concerning
putting together all these things, the prosperity zones and things like
that. Is there an effort to coordinate efforts between these various
organizations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. If I could touch on something, our group just recently made a
decision to bring eight regional operations directors on board within
workforce that their job will be to do just that, is to collaborate
these efforts between all these groups and agencies and to bring those
people together for the first time that we&#39;ve ever done that.
We&#39;ve just advertised for those jobs, they closed out about two
weeks ago, we&#39;re interviewing for somebody to go in to each one of
the eight prosperity

  <p id="40:00">
  Okay. Senator Barefoot?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Thank you Mr. Collins for the good job that
you&#39;re doing over there at NCWorks. Got two questions for you. One
is as you&#39;ve been going through this process and you&#39;re
listening to businesses and listening to industry, a top demand is
workforce and talent. Do you have any sense, or do you have any kind of
numbers or any kind of data on the type of skill sets, degrees,
licenses, that they are seeking, and the way I&#39;m thinking about it
is from licenses to community college degrees to four year degrees, to
PhD, even masters and PhDs. What are you seeing out there as the, the
breakdown of those requirements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One thing we did with our 1100 Program was to ask them what type of
skills they have most interest in and where they&#39;re having the most
difficulty filling those positions, and they&#39;ve shared that with us,
so that&#39;s gonna be part of the data that we&#39;re putting together
that we hope to share within the next probably two or three months
we&#39;ll be rolling that out to the appropriate people. So we&#39;ll
have a more update gathering of data to share once we put all that
together. So we&#39;ve looked at that and asked them, where are you
finding, where are the shortcomings? One of the issues we&#39;re finding
is not just the technical skills but also soft skills, where companies
are telling us we can’t get the right number of people to come in and
have an interest in joining us or staying with us, or attending every
day, or things of that nature. So we&#39;re trying to address those
issues as well with programs supported with the community colleges and
DPI and the workforce board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you speak to that just a little bit about how the, the new kind of
mission and relevancy works? How your relationships are going with the
department of public instruction, the community colleges, and the UNC
system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I&#39;ll be glad to. One is that in our, our relationship as
far as NCWorks, NCWorks was actually a collaboration between community
college and commerce. So we entered into an agreement there a year ago
to talk about the commitment between those two groups, and we&#39;re
doing that, and with DPI. So the projects that we work on on a very
regular basis, we meet, I&#39;m, I&#39;m gonna step out on a limb and
say we have conversations at least once a week with those collaborative
groups if not once every two weeks to talk about different initiatives
that we have under way. We&#39;ve entered into programs to emphasize
career pathways about how we move from K through 12 up through the
community college level into employment. We were also engaged with the
University. I&#39;m very pleased to say that for the first time in
anyone&#39;s history or knowledge, we&#39;ve been invited by the
University of North Carolina system to meet with them and explain to
them what we do in Workforce. That&#39;s the first time that&#39;s
happened, so we&#39;ve actually met with the 16 or 17 universities
through a meeting that they have about once a quarter to talk about the
impact of Workforce. So that&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve been invited
to the table there and we&#39;ve done that. So that&#39;s, that is part
of our progress. That&#39;s where we&#39;re headed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions. Okay, thank you so much for all the good
information. Thank you all for coming. Please come back next Wednesday
at 12 o&#39;clock. The next meeting will be community colleges.
