Sergeant at arms ?? members will go to their seats, members and guests
in the gallery please silence all electronic devices. This microphone's
a little loud, if we could turn it down a little bit that would be
great. Leading the Senate in prayer is Reverend Peter Milnerson at
Chaplain, all members and guests in the gallery, please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lord, as we open up our lips we ask you to bless them. As we act, we ask
you to bless actions. We all come from diverse backgrounds, west, east,
north, south, but we all need your discernment and direction for to ??
business of this great state of North Carolina. We don't want to just
drop our traditions off at the door.  We want our faith to inform
everything. Unless the Lord watches over the city the guards stand watch
in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to
eat, for he grants sleep to those who He loves. Children are a heritage
from the Lord, so open our eyes up today, Lord, once again. Watch over
us. Watch over the children of this state. Bless their teachers,
teachers around the state like Ms. Zucchino and Ms. Smith who bless my
children every day. Pastors, teachers, other moms and dads all over the
state, may we rest in the work that you have started Lord, that you will
complete, as in your name we pray, Amen.
