...and be recognized when I call your name. Rachel Murney from New
Hanover County sponsored by Representative Catlin. Madison Henderson
from Sampson County, sponsored by Representative Lewis. Hunter Mullis
from Lincoln County sponsored by Representative Saine. And Sarah Cleary
from Avery County sponsored by Representative Dobson. Pages, thank you
for being with us today. I hope you've had a good week at the General
Assembly.
Ladies and gentlemen, and members, we are time constrained. We have
about 30 minutes for this meeting before we need to get out of here, so
we're going start by saying that the House Bill 177 is pulled from
today's calendar. You have two bills before you. We're going to begin
with House Bill 832, there's a PCS to this bill that is being passed out
right now. Representative Martin moves that the PCS be before us so
without objection it is. Representative Avila, you are recognized to
present your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and if you would, please I
would like to recognize staff. Ms. Paul to go through the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. House Bill 832 would create a
new section of the general statutes in the Pharmacy Practice Act to
establish a new class or a new definition of an immunizing pharmacist
and it would permit an immunizing pharmacist to administer immunizations
of vaccinations within the constraints, the limitations prescribed in
the bill. Section 1 of the PCS would define immunizing pharmacists and
if you, again, refer to Section 1 of the bill, it indicates a licensed
pharmacist who meets all of the specific qualifications and
certifications that are listed in items 1 through 6.
Section 2 of the bill takes the definition of the practice of pharmacy
from where it's currently located in the general statutes, moves it to
another section. Section 3 of the bill contains the new definition of
the practice of pharmacy, which includes the activities that an
immunizing pharmacist may conduct. Section 4 of the PCS would authorize
an immunizing pharmacist to administer only the vaccines or the
immunizations that meet the criteria of being recognized or recommended
or required by the Centers for Disease Control, can administer to them
only to persons who are 18 years of age or older. The section also lists
the specific vaccinations or immunizations which an immunizing
pharmacist is permitted to administer.
Section 5 just makes conforming changes and Section 6 would direct the
named organizations to cooperate and to collaborate to develop safety
protocols, as well as to develop a questionnaire for patients who come
in to seek an immunization from an immunizing pharmacist.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Ms. Paul. Representative Avila, the
understanding of the Chair that this is a consensus bill that has been
worked out by both parties and there may not be opposition. If you would
speak to that, I would appreciate it. Representative Avila, you're
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Some of you may look at this and wonder,
&quot;Well, OK, what's the big deal?&quot; But in North Carolina it is a
very big deal. We currently recognize pharmacy immunizations for only
three vaccinations. We're one of probably seven or eight States that
have the lower number of vaccinations of the list that is recommended by
the CDC. With this movement and the cooperation of a tremendous group of
professionals, we've opened the door for citizens of the State to reach
a higher level of protection by being able to get these vaccinations at
a pharmacy location. I know one of the things that has been on my mind
and the reason that I was in favor of this, I know many of you are...</p>

<p id="05:00">
news stories regarding the issue of whooping cough, that has been
resurrected in our society and is driven a lot of the discussion. So as
much as I would like to stand up here and tell you how great I am to get
this bill, it is totally the work of the organizations that you saw
named in section six. They did long hours, some hard discussions, and
put the health of the North Carolinians ahead of a lot of
considerations. And Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'd like to be recognized
for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Avila. This time the chair
would also like to recognized Representative Hollo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. A question for the sponsor or
perhaps staff. I just wondered if this definition of immunizing pharmacy
conforms to a national standard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm hearing from staff that she's not aware of what
the, what the national standard is. I'm assuming we have the
Representatives in the audience that might be able to speak to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further members, further discussion, further
debate? Representative [Zucca?].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I just have one question. On the
portion where the pharmacist is supposed to tell the family physician,
whoever's providing the primary care for that within 72 hours, it, how,
how would that work in real life? Would it be a fax, would it be a phone
call? How would that work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you, the section please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's in section four, I was just looking at the
summary here. Said, finally section four would require an immunizing
pharmacist to maintain a record of vaccines administered to patient
within 72 hours to notify the patients' primary care provider that the
vaccine was administered. So I, how do we see conceptually that actually
working, and it, we might need a pharmacist to tell us how that works, I
don't know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It, I would defer to an expert on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, you're recognized as the expert
on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Expert means I was formerly a
pert, I think that's what that means, but, um, we fax it to the doctor's
office. And with regards to the addition-, that's generally how we
notify that we, we, on the day that we admi-, the immunization is
administered is generally faxed by the pharmacy to the doctor's office
notif-, notifying what vaccines are received, the patient's name, date
of birth, and what arm we injected the, um, um, immunization in. With
regards to the question that Doctor Fulghum asked about national
standard, it is in the national standard that pharmacists are trained by
the American Heart Association,American Red Cross on CPR. That's, that's
part of that. The CDC vaccination program that every pharmacist that
administers immunization in consistent with the national standard.
There, it's also consistent that pharmacists are require to have
continuing education on an annual basis, specific to immunizations and
the, all this, every board of pharmacy that has an immunization status
for pharmacists requires that you notify the board of pharmacy that you
are an immunizing pharmacist so they can track who, who, who administers
immunizations. So the five or six things that are listed here are
consistent with. I'm licensed in three states, and I'm an immunizing
pharmacist in all three of those states, and I have to do the same
things for all three states that are listed in section one of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that speaks partially to what I'm trying to
get at, I'm trying to perhaps get the number of states in this country
that recognize this sub-category of pharmaceutical practice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All 50.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All 50, all 50 states recognize immunizing
pharmacists.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [Mr. Allen?], the chair saw you rise, did you, did you
desire to speak?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hollo is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for a favorable report to PCS of House Bill
832, unfavorable to the original, with referral to Commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hollo moves for a favorable report for
the proposed Committee Substitute to House Bill 832, unfavorable to the
origninal, if favorable, moving to commerce and job development. All in
favor signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. The ayes have it.</p>

<p id="10:00">
Bill will be referred to commerce. Again ladies and gentleman we've got
about 20 minutes remaining. It would be the Chair's hope that we have an
opportunity to take a vote today on house bill 900 but we'll see where
the discussion goes. Representative Avila you are recognized for house
bill 900.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and I hope we can reach that
too because I bring before you today a bill that has opposition. We vote
on a lot of things around here that have opposition and you do the best
you can to arrive at a consensus as we did with the previous bill with
all parties concerned. But I feel in this case that with the language as
its been drafted it's as tight as we can make it with the protections of
the law as well as the different organizations within government that
hold responsibility over this particular area of healthcare. What the
bill does is simply allow continuing care retirement communities to be
able to offer home health care services to their residents and their
residents only. And the reason this is something that they were
interested in is because in these continuing care facilities they have
everything from independent living up to skilled nursing care. So they
have the available personnel and the expertise in infrastructure to be
able to offer this to their clients.
The concerns I feel like from the opponents are unwarranted and for
several reasons, One is the language because we specified that ti is for
people that have a contract for lodging but as an extra safety feature
we had reiterated that if at any point in time they try to open that
door into non-resident territory that they will then have to come back
and get a certification for COEN. They will be licensed to offer these
services just like any home health care service provider is, it's just
that this would be another option for their residents to be able to take
advantage of care on their property in terms of the facility. Also there
is the fear of other states and I don't know what other states CON laws
look like or how loose they are or what happened, but I do know here in
North Carolina that the health service regulation division with the
section for certificate of need would be overseeing this, and if any
attempt to circumvent the law that we specified residents contracted
only, they would really come down on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila. The Chair's apologies, the Chair
failed to recognize that we do have a proposed committee substitute, it
is attached to your bill summary if you haven't noticed that members,
and representative Fulghum moves that the proposed committee substitute
be before us and without objection it is. Representative Avila the
Chair's intent and Ive already notified the speakers for and against the
bill that they will have up to five minutes per side to speak to divide
as they choose. I've got a list of speakers. And speakers just be aware
that due to the constraint of the time the chair will be a little bit
more tight in enforcing that than would be usual, but representative
Avila keep that in mind that we are time constrained and we want to hear
from our speakers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The final two points of why I feel like concern is
unwarranted here is the fact that this is isn't precedent setting for
CCRC's. Actually in the 2013 and previous state medical facilities plans
there's already an exemption for CCRC's with regards to nursing beds. So
I feel like they are very well aware of how to comply, and the language
in there says will be used exclusively to meet the needs of people with
whom the facility has continuing care contracts, and that's with regard
to the nursing beds. and I feel like the language that we put into house
bill 900 guarantees us that same level of control. And also it is not a
mandate that the residents use the service, they will still have choice
if they so desire to use another home health care service provider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Avila. At this time the
speakers or the chair is going to recognize the speakers against and for
this bill, and I have speaking we'll start with the speaker against the
bill, I have one speaker that has signed up. It is Tim Rogers CEO for
the Association for Home and Hospice Care.</p>

…by their residents and only for their residents. CCRCs in this state
are not interested in competing in the larger market. All we’d like to
do is to serve our own residents. This bill does not exempt us from
applying for a license, from being regulated by the state. We still have
to go through all of that and follow all of the rules. All this says is
that for the purpose of applying for the license, we wouldn’t have to be
bound by that certificate of need determination. Let me add one other
thing that I think is very important in this discussion. Currently the
state develops a medical facilities plan on an annual basis. In the last
seven years, there have only been seven slots that have opened up
statewide with the provision of home health and that’s been in three
counties. One in Forsyth, three in Wake and three in Mecklenburg. That
means in 97% of the counties in this state, you don’t have an
opportunity to apply for that home health license. All this does is
carve out an exemption for CCRCs to serve their residents and their
residents only.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. I’m Pat Sprig. I am the president and
CEO of Carol Woods, which is the retirement community in Chapel Hill. I
have been in the field for 38 years, serving older adults. In fact so
long that I’ve become one. The reality is that for 20 years I have spent
that at Carol Woods.  Carol Woods has had a reputation of quality
healthcare for 34 years and of that 34 years, we have always had an
exemption of CO and in our skilled nursing Medicare facility. This is
not necessarily anything more than something that we’ve already wanted
to have for awhile. It is not competing with the larger public. It is
not competing in terms of the home health agencies. It’s just being true
to our own residents. The reality is that Carol Woods has a full service
with physicians and nurses and a geriatric nurse practitioner, full
service clinic. We have a home care license. We have assisted living. We
have a skilled Medicare non-CON skilled nursing center. The piece we do
not allow to deliver to our own residents is home health and so the
reason I’ve been there 20 years. I can’t remember when the last CON slot
became available in Orange County. So all we’re asking is for your
understanding that we simply want to give this option to our residents
who are asking for it. Let me put a face on it. My 89 year old mother
lives at my community. I can deliver anything to her except home health
services in which another staff, that she does not know, has to come in
and deliver care to her who does not know her. I am not saying that home
health does not do an excellent job. I am saying that we have continuity
of care. It is one of the reasons why we have such a stellar reputation
of five star nursing home. It is because we care about that family
relationship. I know every resident in my community for 20 years by name
and their families and to sit down and say to them, I’m sorry we cannot
have our staff deliver home healthcare to your apartment, is
unconscionable for me. It is really heart sickening. I ask that you
understand this is nothing more than giving us the ability to serve our
own residents, who live with us in terms of under a contract. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss March your side has about 40 seconds remaining.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Due to the time constraints, I just wanted
to say thank you for your consideration. My colleagues have done well
this morning representing us and our residents really appreciate you
taking a look at that. My name is Heather March, I’m the campus
administrator and health services director at Croasdaile Village in
Durham and we look forward to being able to serve our residents with all
the services possible and allow them resident choice. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee. I’m going to recognize the
bill’s sponsor first who would like to make a motion but I’m going to
also respect the members of the committee and recognize that I will
follow your wishes. We have about five minutes or a little bit more we
can spend with this. If that’s not enough time, we will not vote today
but Representative Avila, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I’d like to make a motion for
favorable report to the P…</p>

[??] for House Bill 900; unfavorable to the original, with a referral to
regulatory reform, and side note, that would give us another shot at
answering questions that people might have, and I would ask for your
support.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Avila.  I'll hold that motion, and
Representative Dollar, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, quick--quick question, then.  Would this preclude, or would
individuals be able to receive information--let's say they're in a
cottage or something at a  continuing care.  Would they be able to
receive information from the service providers--other service providers
of home health services--other than the home grown one within their
community?  In other words, would they be able to continue to have
choice, in a sense, of who they would--if they decided that they wanted
to have somebody that they were very comfortable with from the outside
coming in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do not see this as a mandate that the only option they would have
would be within the service of the CCRC, that they would still have the
option of choice, which is what they have now.  They are given a list
and they make their decisions from that list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  I have a quick question somewhat related to that--that I
think the first speaker, Tim, brought up--he may be able to answer;
somebody else may be able to answer.  You made some comment about
doctors not being able to sign the contract, and I'm wondering if that
means if they are a resident of the CCRC, and they want to pursue
someone other than the care provider at the CRCC [sic], does somebody
have to sign something that would then possibly be deemed as, well I
won't sign it because I work for this facility and you are an outside
provider.  And, I'm not sure if that's what he meant, but I--somebody,
if they know the answer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you would, please recognize yourself again for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tim Rogers, with the Association for Home and Hospice Care of North
Carolina. We have a self-referral statute in federal law.  Physicians
cannot self-refer to hospital-based agencies, much less CCRC's.  Meaning
nurse practitioners, PA's, they do a great job of hiring a very good
clinical staff, but they would not be able to sign the initial plan of
care.  That would be from a discharging physician in a hospital, or
someone else, and then they would also not be able to sign what's now
required by Medicare, and Dr. Fulghum can--can elaborate on this--the
face to face documentation that now Medicare has placed on physicians,
to do in the first 60 days of a home health plan of care, the receiving
physician must see the patient again in his office or her office, and
sign a face to face.  But the physician that is employed or contracted
by the CCRC, to my knowledge, would not be able to do the face to face
documentation, or the initial plan of care.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I've got five members in the queue.  Representative
Baskerville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow-up, Mr. Speaker.  Just to--I mean--Mr. Chair.  I'll make it
real quick.  Since this is the health committee, I think that's an
important question we need to get answered.  We're out of time, but I
would ask them to make sure that the members of the committee who might
be on reg reform, of which I am not one, gets that information.
Because, I think that is a health issue and this is the health committee
and I want to make sure I understand it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.  Representative Baskerville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  We've heard a lot about residents, but I don't
see the word resident anywhere in the statute.  It seems to me that the
language in the statute talking about individuals who have entered into
a contract with the continuing care retirement community--I mean--that's
not clear to me.  That does mean resident.  I mean, I don't see--we're
talking about residents and we're worried about the impact on the
residents, why that explicit term is not in the statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The term that covers that here is the phrase with lodging, as it
recognizes the contract between the CCRC and the resident, that lodging
is a requirement for this applicative delivery of services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, by show of hands, how many of you are prepared to vote on this
bill today?  How many of you are not?  We'll displace this bill; we'll
take it up at our next meeting.  Ladies and Gentlemen, this meeting's
adjourned. [end of data]</p>
