Members and guest I would like to welcome everybody the House Committee
on agriculture on this beautiful, beautiful February day. It’s good to
be inside the building, we are thankful for your attendance here and
look forward to very good presentation shortly. Today we have four pages
with us that I would like to introduce first, Harrison McNeil from
Randolph County sponsored by Representative Allen McNeil, Erin Kennedy
from Cumberland County, Representative John Szoka, Hope Kim from Orange
County, Representative Verla Insko, and Mark from Stanly County now,
Representative Justin Burr, and Mark with us all the way from Germany.
Welcome to our wonderful North Carolina weather, Mark we hope you pages
have a great time here this week. Our Sergeants-at-Arm and I don’t think
we have to use many bullets today so you can pick those away, Bill ??,
Mark Hone and Joe Cook, we are grateful to have the Sergeant-at-Arms
with us today. We have a wonderful presentation; we are very privileged
to have with us Dr. Richard H Linton, he’s the Dean of the North
Carolina State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and I
would like for our pages to pay particular attention to this
presentation, you might see something in this that gives you a little
bit different view on what agriculture is really about in particular in
North Carolina State University and that what state have to offer. Dean
Linton has come into North Carolina at a very unique time in our
history. We are in the process of a transition period from that which
was traditional to different avenues and I have seen portions of the
presentation that he would be given to us today, this will not be the
last time that you will see this kind of, these proposals and so forth
so Dean Linton to make this presentation to us and welcome to the House
Committee on agriculture dean Linton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I need an Engineer to be able to figure out which button to press. Good
afternoon everyone I certainly wanna to thank all of you for being here
today especially with the inclimate weather, I’m certainly wanna to
reach out to Mr. Dickson and thank you for the invitation to be here.
Today, I have been asked to talk about some important initiatives in
North Carolina agriculture that have surfaced over the last several
years, I will focus my presentation today on the North Carolina plant
sciences initiative, we will also talk about two other important topics
which is food manufacturing and student axis for a four year degree
program. You should have four handouts that should be past around, there
should be copy of my presentation which is six copies of slides per
page, there should also be an abstract and executive summary on the
North Carolina plant sciences initiative then there should also be a one
page document on plant sciences and a one page document on student axis
all very important topics that you are talking about today. You know,
when you look at some of the challenges in agriculture and some of the
challenges of a Dean of such a great college here in North Carolina we
got a tremendous challenge in moving forward ahead, we got this great
challenge of feeding the world and to be able to feed 9.3 people by the
year 2050. So in the next 30 to 35 growing seasons we are gonna have to
make tremendous changes to be able to double the food supply and enhance
technology by 70 to 100%. And we have to deal with all sorts of
challenges less land, less water, more pest and disease that still at
the same time protecting our environment. So three years ago when I
joined the State of North Carolina and North Carolina State University I
went around the state and started a process of…

  Future which was a strategic plan, not just for the college of
agriculture and life sciences but a strategic plan for the state of
North Carolina when it comes to agriculture. And really the question we
were trying to answer from an economic standpoint is how can we grow our
number one economic engine in North Carolina and build jobs and enhance
our economy? And five kinds of ideas surfaced from the strategic
planning initiative a couple of years ago. They&#39;re listed here, one
on leadership, one on student access, one on food animal products, one
on plant science, so the outcomes associated with the plant sciences
component of these ideas. If you recall, there were two legislative
initiatives were bills last year that were supported to be able to do an
economic feasibility study in two separate areas, and, and Jimmy Dixon
and James Langdon were the two coauthors on the House side in moving
this legislation forward. One of the economic feasibility studies was on
plant sciences and the other was on food processing and food
manufacturing. Those economic feasibility studies have been completed
and they were delivered as, as promised January one of this year, and I
think those have been made available to your committee. If for some
reason they have not been made available to, to your committee, I&#39;ll
just share with you a website here. It&#39;s CALS, which stands for the
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, .ncsu.edu and that full
economic feasibility study can be found on the website. What I&#39;ve
handed out to you is a very small condensed version which just includes
the executive summary and the abstract. I think in total, the
document&#39;s about 170 pages. So again, today, I&#39;d like to focus
on the plant sciences initiative. And, and I guess I want to start out
by saying that what, what&#39;s exciting about the plant sciences
initiative is it&#39;s partnership driven and it&#39;s stakeholder
driven. We arrived at the plant sciences initiative by visiting some 20
plus sites around the state of North Carolina and meeting face to face
with over 3,000 stakeholders, and now a stakeholder driven process in
partnership with Farm Bureau and the commissioner of agriculture. And
many stakeholders throughout the state, we feel like the North Carolina
plant sciences initiative can be the thing that can move agriculture
forward in North Carolina. Certainly it&#39;s an aspiration for
innovative research, and really the innovative research spans from
opportunities to grow farming operations in rural North Carolina as well
as growing our very exciting research triangle park initiatives just 20
minutes outside of Raleigh. We hope to be able to provide a competitive
edge for our students. I think, as you see what we&#39;re trying to do
with this initiative, we&#39;re trying to change our students. We&#39;re
trying to change our students so they are focused on multi disciplines
around agriculture, so they understand engineering, they understand
economics, they understand plants, they understand animals, and
they&#39;re also working with industry hand in hand to understand
important and applied problems. We like to make our students better so
that they&#39;re better equipped not only to start in the job market,
but to provide leadership right out of the gate. And last and not least
and maybe most important is this is a commitment to our heritage.
It&#39;s a commitment to our farmers throughout the state of North
Carolina. So you might be thinking, why plant sciences? Why, why here
and why now? I think what&#39;s, what&#39;s unique to North Carolina is
we have a very unique set of assets. We have almost every kind of
climate, almost every type of soil type which gives us the ability to
grow many different types of plants. In fact, if you look at different
states in the United States, we&#39;re the third most diverse state when
it comes to the production of different plant products. So I guess what
I&#39;m saying is we could take a new corn variety and grow it in five
places in North Carolina and mimic what could happen in Iowa, in
Indiana, in Pennsylvania, in Northern Georgia, and sites in Texas. No
other state has that capacity and ability to be able to do so and in
partnership with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, we can do
this across 18 different research stations located throughout the state
of North Carolina. The idea here is to be able to create jobs as well,
and from the economic feasibility study, I&#39;ll show you some very
exciting numbers related to two important economic indicators. One is
jobs, and the other is an increase to our economy. Our goal is to be
able to train tomorrow&#39;s leaders, but train tomorrow&#39;s leaders
in a way that&#39;s not, that, that&#39;s never been done before. Of
course, to be able to increase the ag profits both here and abroad, to
be able to, to meet the goal

  that the Commission of Agriculture has had for many years and wishes to
grow the already strong economy of 78 billion to 100 billion by the year
2020. What&#39;s unique about this initiative, as you&#39;ll see as we
start to talk more about it, is this makes a difference in people&#39;s
lives in rural communities, especially farmers&#39; lives, and it also
makes a difference in the lives of people in urban components of North
Carolina, especially surrounding those companies in Research Triangle
Park. We can be the world leader in plant sciences in North Carolina,
much like California is the silicone valley area in California for
microchips, the state of North Carolina has the same opportunity to be
world-class and world-best in the area of plants. Nobody else has
Research Triangle Park 20 minutes away, coupled with the diversification
in plant products with multiple soil types and multiple climate types.
We&#39;ve got a very unique scenario and situation here in North
Carolina. This slide shows the overall economic impact shown from both
economic feasibility studies, the Plant Sciences Initiative and the Food
Processing Manufacturing Initiative. And the two numbers I want to
highlight is the opportunity to be able to grow, in a 10 year period, up
to 70,000 jobs and add 19.5 billion to the North Carolina economy,
thereby growing our economy from 78 billion to the stated goal of almost
100 billion. A tremendous impact economically that can be done with the
synergy of these two initiatives. So let&#39;s talk a little bit more
about the Plant Sciences Initiative so that you can understand what
we&#39;re trying to accomplish. Again, we&#39;re trying to take
advantage of the uniqueness that we have in the state of North Carolina
with the diversity of plant products and the diversity of climates and
soil types around the state of North Carolina. This slide shows the
different research stations that are coupled with the partnership of the
North Carolina Department of Agriculture at NC State University.
We&#39;re now trying to take advantage of this, to be able to grow
plants and plant sciences within North Carolina. Our idea is to take
advantage of these assets, bring great ideas to light, invest in
research, and create a partnership where industry, academia, and
government can be working hand-in-hand to leverage our ideas and to be
able to leverage our resources. It&#39;s about innovative technologies.
It&#39;s about developing new varieties. New varieties that are drought
resistant, disease resistant, that produce faster, that produce at a
higher quality. It&#39;s about producing new food products. It&#39;s
about increased industry capital, job growth, and we&#39;ll show you
those numbers in just a minute, and producing a workforce that&#39;s not
only trained to work in the workforce, but trained for leadership
opportunities. Our goal is to be able to produce, in an academic
institution, is to be able to produce a pipeline of students. To be able
to fulfill the needs of agriculture in the future. Today, in the state
of North Carolina, we have about 30,000 new jobs in agriculture each and
every year, and we&#39;ve got to find a way to fulfill the need of the
future, of more job growth development in the future. So I don&#39;t
want to talk a whole lot about science, but just to let you know that
the committee who did the economic feasibility study has said that we
should be focusing on a much more different area. Rather than focusing
on silo disciplines like crop science and plant science and soil science
and engineering, they said what we really ought to be doing is focusing
on the interdisciplinary network that brings all those disciplines
together over areas such as crop protection, plant adaptation, precision
agriculture, and agrasymbiotics. And this comes after interviews with
over 180 different stakeholders, both in North Carolina and around the
country that are focused in plant science areas. This is what the
industry needs, these kinds of inter-disciplines and a workforce that
can fulfill them. The Plant Sciences Initiative also works very well
with the Plants for Human Health Institute, Kannapolis, North Carolina.
I think as many of you know, that&#39;s focused on the utilization of
plants for the betterment of human health, and I think this initiative
fits well, and is a nice extension out to the use of plants for the
benefit of human health. Here are some of the exciting job and economic
indicators that came out of the economic feasibility study for the Plant
Sciences Initiative. It&#39;s estimated in a 10 year period that we
could grow by 32,000 jobs and enhance our economy by 9.2 billion, which
are very exciting economic forecast numbers to look at

  In order to be able to make this plant sciences initiative work
effectively, we have three goals. That is to first build
interdisciplinary teams, interdisciplinary teams again, that are made up
of crop scientists and soil scientists and economists and engineers to
study the real complex challenges, challenges like water use and water
management, food security, food safety where an interdisciplinary team
is required. The second is to be able to build business and academic
partnerships. We envision this initiative involving hand in hand
relationships with companies and hand in hand relationships with
government, not only in the state of North Carolina but at the federal
level. And the third goal is to be able to create a world class facility
in order to create this energy and bring together the different
interdisciplines, and bring together the synergy of business, academic
partnerships, and government. This is the envisioned future of a complex
that we&#39;re looking forward to creating. This would be a new plant
sciences complex on the centennial campus on the North Carolina state
university campus. This would be best in the world facilities, and as
you look at this figure, if you look all the way on the right hand side,
this area here would be segmented and separated for industry. And the
idea is a company like BASF or Bayer Crop Sciences or even the corn
growers&#39; association could lease space in this facility and have
access to an interdisciplinary network of scientists as well as students
at the undergraduate and the graduate level. No one else in the country
has tried to bring these interdisciplines together, and to be able to
bring industry and academia together in this way, and we think it&#39;s
a very important direction for the future. Just to give you an idea of
what we&#39;re envisioning, again, world class facility that has best in
class greenhouse facilities to be able to study plants, provide an
environment for interdisciplinary collaboration and environment for
exchange of ideas across both the interdisciplinary network of NC state
scientists as well as industry that might also occupy the building.
I&#39;ve done this kind of job for 25 years and I&#39;ve seen good ideas
and I&#39;ve seen really great ideas, and in my 25 years I&#39;ve never
seen an idea that has had so much interest and so much support. This is
the Commissioner of Agriculture&#39;s, one of his most important
initiatives. It&#39;s North Carolina farm bureau&#39;s number one
interest this year legislatively, and it&#39;s certainly a very
important initiative for the college of agriculture and life sciences in
North Carolina State. Not only is industry interested from a, a support
standpoint, but they&#39;re also putting funds together to be able to
help move this initiative forward to be able to help create this plant
sciences complex. And you can see, here to date just in the last couple
of months the college in collaboration with state quota groups has been
able to raise about $7.5 million. Our goal is to be able to raise $9
million during this legislative session. It&#39;s about new varieties
and improved crops. I thought I would just provide one example of what
we&#39;re trying to do but from any other plant. This is the story of
the sweet potato. In 2005, the sweet potato was not a very important
product in the state of North Carolina. Ten years later, we&#39;re
number one in the country, number one in the country two fold more than
any other state. It&#39;s because of interdisciplinary work around new
variety development, it&#39;s engineers that are involved in the
storage, and it&#39;s crop scientists that are involved in better crop
production practices, to be able to take us from not even on the map to
number one in the country. This slide also shows the different
byproducts that have come from sweet potatoes. Sweet potato french fries
which now represent about 3% of the market. Sweet potato puree
that&#39;s used in baby food formulations around the country and around
the world. We can, we can envision the future in plant sciences in
having multiple stories like the sweet potato story, and we think North
Carolina is a great place to be able to make this happen. I think this
is low risk and high reward, that the plant sciences complex that I
showed you is $180 million investment. That&#39;s a big investment. In
order to be a world class facility that engages and brings together the
different disciplines and also brings together government, industry, and
academia, you need to have a world class space that compares with
what&#39;s going on at Bayer Crop Science and ?? and BASF. And someone
said boy, $180 million is a big number for agriculture if that&#39;s
what the investment would be like

  <p id="20:00">
  Long term, but I would suggest that we should think about it in a
different perspective. Yes, $180 million is a lot of money, but $180
million investment represents one fourth of 1% of a one year return on
the $78 billion agriculture industry. And whenever we invest in
agriculture research, every $1 that is invested in ag research brings
$19.20 back to our economy. I would argue it&#39;s a very smart
investment moving North Carolina agriculture forward. In tandem with the
plant sciences initiative, we&#39;ve also had an adjoining initiative,
which is the food processing and manufacturing initiative. I&#39;ll
spend less time talking about that today, but it&#39;s about building a
network. It&#39;s about building the opportunity of bringing ingredients
together with packaging materials to produce value added products,
things like canned food products or frozen food products or, or
refrigerated food products. Value added products which make a tremendous
difference in the economy. Let me give you a very simple example to
think about. A simple can of green beans. If a simple can of green beans
is $1, about six cents of that can is the beans. Seven to eight cents of
that can is the can and the label that goes on the outside. The
ingredients are put into the can and then sent up to the Midwest so that
they can be processed in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus, Ohio will sell us
that can back for 70 cents. All Columbus, Ohio is doing is putting beans
in a can, putting the lid on it and cooking it. I would argue that North
Carolina can put beans in a can and cook it. So we&#39;re trying to take
a look at what kinds of opportunities can we connect different commodity
ingredients with end finished products to be able to attract new
investments and new, new companies coming to the state of North
Carolina. The job potential and the economic potential if food
manufacturing was ever to become a reality could be absolutely huge for
North Carolina. You can see another 38,000 jobs and $10.3 billion. Six
years, that&#39;s all it would take if the state of North Carolina can
find a way to be able to build this new way of thinking, this new
economy to replace jobs and from the textile industry and the furniture
industry as an example. The steps that are ongoing with the food
manufacturing initiative, there is a state wide governor&#39;s task
force that&#39;s being discussed at the moment. In fact, I&#39;ve got a
meeting tomorrow with the lieutenant governor&#39;s office to talk about
this task force which was mentioned in the state of the state address
of, from our governor several weeks ago. We&#39;re also working, as part
of the economic feasibility study, there was a recommendation in a
series of steps to provide funding of $1.5 million over a three year
period and we&#39;re working to get that externally funded to be able to
help the state of North Carolina take a look at this, I think, wonderful
opportunity. So as a summary, these are the two economic feasibility
studies, North Carolina plant sciences, North Carolina food processing
and manufacturing. The outcome, the hope, the dream on the plant
sciences initiative is the creation of this initiative and as a part of
that, as a plant sciences complex, which we&#39;re working on. And on
the food manufacturing, there&#39;s a state task force and an external
funding for the initiative. If we circle back to the plant sciences
complex, what we&#39;re trying to accomplish is there&#39;s a need for
$18 million to get this project started, for planning money, for
creation of this facility, this world class facility. The $9 million
that we are raising would be 50% of what would be required. We would be
asking for the state for their help in moving this initiative forward. I
also wanted to take just a few minutes if I still have the time. This
was an issue that I spoke about at a breakfast a few weeks ago that Mr.
Dixon was at that he really did wanted me to talk about, and it has to
do with student access, student access to get a four year degree in
agriculture. Let me give you a bad statistic. Jobs and agriculture in
the state of North Carolina, 54% of those jobs are taken by students
that don&#39;t have a degree in agriculture, that have never stepped
foot on a farm. I think somehow we&#39;ve got to change that. I think
somehow, we&#39;ve got to provide opportunities for kids who grow up on
a farm that want to get a degree in agriculture and finding ways to be
able to accomplish that even when it&#39;s very, very difficult to get
into a state university. So that&#39;s kind of the driver that&#39;s led
to this discussion. I just wanted to share with you global rankings.
These are our global rankings in different areas of agriculture. You can
see that we range from

  Seventeenth to twenty-fourth in the world. Our goal is to be fifth in
the world in agriculture. That’s our strategic plan in moving forward
and being third in the United States. If you take a look at application
trends for North Carolina State University, as it is with many other
state universities in the state of North Carolina, there’s a lot of
interest in coming to North Carolina State University and the
application trends have significantly increased. That’s great news for
the university. But, it also means that it’s more and more difficult, in
order to get accepted into different colleges, including the College of
Agriculture and Life Sciences. This slide shows the average SAT that’s
needed across the UNC system. You can see UNC-Chapel Hill requires the
highest SAT and North Carolina State is second. You can see there in the
top right, the average SAT was at 1266 in 2014. This dean did not have a
1266, I guarantee you, and somehow I became dean. I’m not sure how
that’s happened. But because the higher SAT scores, we need to be a
little bit more creative in finding alternative pathways to get into
North Carolina State. One of the things that we’re doing, which is
supported the Cooperative Extension Service, is a program called ASPIRE.
And, the goal of ASPIRE is to enhance and increase SAT scores. And, the
ASPIRE program, you can see, is offered in 40 different counties in
North Carolina. It involves 30 hours of instruction and it increases the
SAT score by about 150 points. So, this dean plus ASPIRE has a chance to
get into North Carolina State University. Without ASPIRE, maybe I don’t
have that opportunity. But, we’re also trying to create pathways,
alternative pathways to the 4 year degree. We have partnerships with a
number of North Carolina community colleges and we also have a new
program in house called the STEAM program and these programs are a
combination of time at NC State and time at another university, in order
to be able to accomplish this 4 year degree program. The STEAM program,
which was just launched 2 years ago, but the way in which this program
works is kids come are not accepted into the traditional 4 year degree
program. This is another option. This is another alternative. They come
to NC State the summer before their freshman year. They then leave for
their freshman year and go to another university and then come back for
their next 3 years, as long as they have a 3.0 GPA and have taken
certain courses. It has made a significant difference in providing
opportunities for kids and for students that would not have not been
successful in the traditional route. It’s a very, very exciting program
that’s got a lot of interest around the state, especially in rural
communities where SAT scores are many times not as high as they are in
urban communities. So with that, I know I’ve probably taken a little bit
more time than you would’ve liked. But, again I thank you for the
opportunity to be here to talk about what I think are very exciting
things going on in North Carolina related to agriculture and related to
the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You. Excuse me. Thank you very much Dean Linton and if they’re any
questions or comments, we’ll take those from the committee members.
While you’re thinking, let me say this. I would venture to say that not
a single one of us in this room today gave 1 ounce of thought about what
we were going to eat today. I would dare say that most of us think
it&#39;ll be there tomorrow. I would dare say that it’s been several
weeks or maybe several months since we or any of the folks in North
Carolina gave a lot of serious attention to about what we were going to
eat because we’ve had such a plentiful supply of it and we’ve been able
to go out and get it when we need it. I believe that what we’ve
witnessed here this afternoon and what I have seen at different times
over the past year and a half, I believe that 50 or 60 or 100 years from
now, when the history of North Carolina is written and agriculture is
put into its proper place, those of us here today have been privileged
to be present at the very genesis of a new direction for agriculture in
North Carolina. And, I can’t emphasize that any more than that. And so,
I want us to be excited about being a part of the House Agriculture
Committee because in the absence of food.

about, not only being able to produce more food on less land with less
water, but also putting it in a method that we can sell it to other
people to satisfy their needs. If you have, I&#39;m gonna make one more
thing while I&#39;m on my political stump speech here, and, and use the
bully pulpit. I remember one time when I was a little teen fellow
George, at Miss Eva James&#39;s store in the community of friendship.
There was a man in there by the name of ??. He spoke to my uncle whose
name was Huey, and he said this. He said Huey, you and I probably
won&#39;t live long enough to see it, but our grandchildren may, and
I&#39;m one of those grandchildren now. That we may live long, they may
live long enough to see a day when a man will be willing to trade one
diamond for one potato if it&#39;s a pretty big potato.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A North Carolina sweet potato.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. So that&#39;s my stump speech for the day and I&#39;m excited to be
here. Dean Linton, thank you for your vision, and I consider myself to
be privileged to be on the front end of this new direction that
we&#39;re taking in, in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. I grew up on the farm I live on today and
definitely appreciate your briefing, and by the way it&#39;s national
FFA week this week too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two things. One the military research station, the incredible work that
it does. I hope we can get a ?? of scientists back there. When it comes
to the plant science initiatives that you briefed, I suppose that it
will probably have some differences than the apparatus we have in
Kannapolis in terms of its mission. Can you clarify that a little,
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, it&#39;s, it&#39;s completely different but synergistic. The plant
sciences initiatives here will be about solving those complex global
issues, things around water use and water management, food security,
feeding the world, productivity, new varieties, food safety and
security, bioenergy, things that involve plants as being a resource and
source for human feed, for animal feed, and for bioenergy. If you really
think about the work in which is done in Kannapolis, from a strategic
standpoint, that would be a good addition or a good add on to a plant
sciences initiative. If I were strategically trying to build it and put
it together, it would be the second step rather than the first step. So
I think it fits really nicely because at the end of the day, we know how
important plants are gonna be, and we also know how important human food
is gonna be for human health. And so the growth and the collaboration
and synergism across both I think is gonna be very important. Another
thing I will tell you that will be very, very important in our future
outside of feeding the world and being able to double the food supply is
at some point in time, we&#39;re gonna have to do a better job of
connecting food and ag systems with human health. Like I&#39;ve just
been asked to share an APLU committee, which is the Association of
Public and Land Grant Universities on a $150 million per year initiative
from USDA which focuses on just that. We know that 85% of our healthcare
costs are associated with chronic disease and things like obesity, and
we know that agriculture and food systems, food systems have a big part
in that, but we&#39;ve never connected the two together. So Kannapolis
would allow us to do that kind of ahead of our time. Strategically I
think it makes sense. I think just the order is different than I would
have done originally.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. How does this, we mentioned Kannapolis, but we&#39;ve done,
we&#39;ve had a biotech center, agriculture has a very broad reach in
North Carolina and we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve try to lead in past decades and
we want to continue our leadership so I applaud that kind of ambition,
because second best doesn&#39;t, doesn&#39;t get the apple any longer.
You want to be world class. A couple of things, you mentioned when you
were on the knowledge pipeline, that there are 30,000 new jobs in
agriculture each year, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s sort of turnover or what does that represent?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s more turnover than actual new jobs. There&#39;s, and
what&#39;s happening with that transition is we&#39;re transition,
transitioning from three groups of jobs

  <p id="35:00">
  To one group of jobs. The three groups of jobs that we&#39;re
transitioning from is agrobusiness, is animal sciences, and agronomy.
And those are being transitioned into plant science related jobs. So
the, the goal is that, and on the one pager that you&#39;ve got it talks
about 84% of jobs in the future in agriculture will involve a plant
science component. So the 30,000 new jobs that I talked about are
actually a transition, the delta&#39;s zero. With the plant sciences
initiative and with the food manufacturing initiative, those are truly
new jobs that are not here today. So it&#39;s a good point of
clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, if I may. The, let&#39;s see, your access for students,
I&#39;m assuming you need more students in agriculture?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the boys down on the farm aren&#39;t signing up or, or not getting in
or.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, there&#39;s a couple of challenges that we have. We need more boys
and girls.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Boys and girls. Yeah, FFA in my county is more young ladies than young
men now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So our college is 78% women, so it&#39;s much more, and some departments
like animal sciences are more like 85% women, so that, that&#39;s also
been a big shift and a big change. But the future is we are gonna need
more students in the future, and the balance is going to need to change.
The balance, we need to, to be able to have the heavy emphasis we have
in animal sciences, because two thirds of our agriculture is the poultry
industry and the turkey industry. But the difference is in moving
forward the area that we&#39;re gonna need to grow to enhance our
student numbers is around the plant sciences area to, to, to get us
ready for the future. Today, about 20% of our undergraduate students
have a plant science major and if 84% of the new jobs are gonna be in
plant sciences, we&#39;ve got to change that number. We&#39;ve got to
increase that number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody. Co chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Dean. I just wanted to ask a question about the, the, the
hydroponics or that type of industry. So far, as I know, the Lord
hasn&#39;t moved us closer to the equator or anything, so we still have
a, a seasonal economy for a lot of products but yet it seems like
something like hydroponics or some of those are going to be able to take
that production that we would actually have to import and, and be able
to grow here. Could you give, just briefly on that and probably connect
the two, the plant science project that you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I think it&#39;s a really good question. I think building new
technologies, I feel funny. I&#39;ve got to do this. I think building
two new technologies is actually going to be very critical in being able
to be able to feed the world and be able to double the food supply. I
think hydroponics was one example of a technology that might allow us to
get there.  Another very exciting technology is growing food products
especially vegetables and fruits in hoop systems. So we now have a
farmer just outside of Wilmington. His name is Cal Lewis, and Cal Lewis
is able to grow strawberries 365 days a year because he has these hoop
houses and the temperature doesn&#39;t get cold enough that, with the
protection of the hoop houses, we can extend our growing seasons.
It&#39;s ideas like that with less land, with less water, with more
challenging pests, it&#39;s ideas like that that we need to work through
through our plant sciences initiative to kind of outsmart the challenges
that we have. Hydroponics could be one. Hoop houses could yet be
another.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, and I can&#39;t see.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Willingham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Willingham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. My question is this. You talk about the food processing. What is
it, and that seemed to be low hanging fruit for us here in North
Carolina. What is that we are not doing or what is it we can do to speed
up that process of having process the food here, because we grow a lot
of the, as you mentioned, a lot of the crops that we&#39;re sending out
to be processed to come back that we pay more for. So what is it that
we&#39;re not doing or what is it we can do to facilitate that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we have four minutes left.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I think you&#39;ve asked the $64,000 question that this government,
that the governor&#39;s task force hopefully will come up with some
solutions, and there&#39;s also some solutions that are in the economic
feasibility study that&#39;s, that&#39;s published and online

  <p id="40:00">
  ...but it&#39;s about connecting ingredients with finished products, but
more importantly it&#39;s about insentivizing business to want to come
to North Carolina. Today, the hub of food manufacturing is in Columbus,
Ohio. I spent over two years of my life as a department head of a food
science and technology program because of my expertise in food
manufacturing. And the reason it was in Columbus, Ohio was because in
the 1960s, if you took a 500-mile radius and you drew it around
Columbus, it represented seventy-percent of the population. And there
were energy savings in Columbus, Ohio because it&#39;s cold in the
winter and energy is less for freezing and refrigeration. Forty years
later-- Fifty years later, things have completely changed. Now when you
look at the southeast and you draw a 500-mile radius around Raleigh,
North Carolina, you have seventy-percent of the population. So,
there&#39;s a great opportunity to be able to shift the hub from where
it is today to where it could be in the southeast. But, I think a big
part of it is going to be about how can we make North Carolina more
attractive than places in the Midwest, and I think that&#39;ll be the
biggest challenge that the lieutenant governor&#39;s office, commerce,
NC State, North Carolina Department of Agriculture -- and the many
stakeholders that will likely make up this task force -- will help to
try to come up with some recommendations. If we can figure that out, I
think we could make a tremendous change and positive move forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Riddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Dean.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You&#39;re welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Real quick question. Can you give me a brief snapshot of the equine
industry in North Carolina and trends for the future?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The equine industry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m not going to have my specific data points here. I can tell you
some of the things that we&#39;re doing. We&#39;re working with the vet
school to be able to try to combine our programs together. The vet
school wants to be able to create better facilities. We have land with
not-so-great facilities, so we&#39;re working to be able to share our
land and our not-so-great facilities, and the vet school&#39;s trying to
be able to build new facilities on that land so that we can partner to
be able to make a more efficient and a more synergistic relationship.
Relative to the equine program, it&#39;s a pretty big piece of the
animal science department. We have four faculty members out of about
seventeen, so it&#39;s about twenty to twenty-five percent of what we do
in animal sciences and continues to be a very important program in North
Carolina.
