Senate will come to order. Sergeant arms will close the doors. Members
will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will please
silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the
Reverend Peter Milliner Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us pray. Father in Heaven, as we come to the end of this week, and
grow closer towards Good Friday and Easter, may we hear the words of a
christian martyr. We cannot do everything, and there is a sense of
liberation in realizing that. This enables us to do something, and to do
it very, very well. It may be incomplete, but it's the beginning, a step
along the way, an opportunity for the Lord's grace to enter and do the
rest. We may never see the end result, but that's the difference between
the master builder and the worker. We are workers, not master builders.
Ministers, not messiahs. We are prophets of a future that is not our
own. We pray in Jesus' name, Amen.

Speaker1:   The loss of lives, these attracted many as far as New York
an I am retracing their family roots . I am reflecting on these
occurrences  and  these activities that have taken place over the last
three days in Green county and in the midst of the tremendous tragedy
here, one of the things that cheer the historians sight is that just in
the midst of the tragedy this actually opened up the Westward
development of the state of North Carolina. Because this was the
actually the last organized effort of native Americans in fighting
against the colonists. So with that I would like to send forth a
Senatorial statement.
Speaker changes: Forward your statement senator.
Speaker changes: Any other notices or announcements.
Speaker changes: Representative Apodaca  state your purpose.
Speaker changes: Motion please.
Speaker changes: You have the floor for motion.
Speaker changes: Mr. President , thank you very much. If you have any
bill placed on the counter for Monday April 1, I am moving that they be
removed from April, 1 and they be re-ferred to Tuesday April,2nds
counter.
Speaker changes: Objection .
Speaker changes: Supported?
Speaker changes:  xxx or what purpose you arise?
Speaker changes: Personal privilege please.
Speaker changes:  Lady has the floor for personal privilege.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. President.  As many as you are here xx
for no.I have been speaking against the mindless  proliferation of guns
in our state and our nation. First more and more people who legislators
have passed and more have been introduced in this session. I have
opposed these   just statistics of the alarming number of people killed
by guns; homicides, accidents and suicides which by the way account for
one-third of gun deaths .Easily available guns allow for impulsive,
thoughtless   and immature action. xxx There have been thousands killed.
But we thought that would be the end; but that was only the beginning. I
keep track of gun deaths  in an informal way. I cut them  out of the
 newspaper. Last year I gave those away to somebody but I have collected
many more since then; as many as you would like to look at if you would
like to. We have accidents where fathers have accidentally shot three
year old children, we have accidents where three year old children have
accidentally killed fathers. Every week we have daily shootings. Perhaps
you don’t realize but as I said   keep track of this; every week  since
New town there has been mass killings. But it is not  even on the front
pages anymore., but I read about it. Last week a baby in a stroller was
shot in the face. When is enough, enough? Those too are your people??
all the time and by the thousands in this country. I can give you this
chart to show the difference. What is unique about guns? It’s quick and
immediate. That is what is different about guns and other means of
killing people. Do we really need military weapons on our streets? and
in the hands of the xx. Do we really need hand guns in our new cities
where Black children are killing Black children.  Basically these
weapons have only one purpose, to kill people. Ninety percent of the
guns recovered from the Mexican wars by the way came from our country.
And a lot of these , I am not talking about legally permitted guns, and
people who are permitted are people who are rational, conscientious, who
are good citizens who are responsible. That’s not our gun problem; our
gun problem is the extreme proliferation. Guns that are easy to get at
the corner store. In our country alone 32672 gun deaths in 2011.Today
across the country more than a hundred ..</p>

Events were taking place to drive this as the largest day of advocacy in
U.S. history to address gun violence. Mothers, law enforcement,
faith-communities and mayors are demanding action. In Durham, Chapel
Hill ??, and Durham near Belville are holding a press conference with
faith leaders to protest.  Charlotte and Raleigh are holding press
conferences. These are held all across the United States.  And yes it is
serious, Mr. Apodaca, it is a serious question. I’m sorry, but I’m going
to keep speaking my limit.  The American people are strongly in favor of
background checks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe time has run. Mr. President? Rule 15, 3 minutes.  Mr.
President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are over time at this point so Senator Kinnaird, if I could ask you
to finalize your comments as quickly as possible please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I won’t talk about the poll since I have been cut short on what is a
very serious subject and I have heard people speak on very serious
subjects for a lot longer than their allotted time.  But I want to talk
about the second amendment and I will wrap up.  Heller vs. the District
of Columbia. That is the latest that overturned 100 years of decisions
that said the militia was a naval and army force. What they say is,
nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast out on long standing
prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and mentally ill,
or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as
schools and government buildings, or laws opposing conditions and
qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. I ask you to take this
very seriously. We have what amounts to as slaughter in this country.
And that means your children, very well could be effected.  Thank you
Mr. Chair, President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. Senator Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to talk about valid crime in the
United States today. In the last five years valid crime has gone done
15% in our state. It’s actually gone down 50% in the last 20 years. We
have the lowest level of violent crime in the United States since 1974.
Well anyone to stand in this chamber and talk about mass slaughter
occurring on our streets constantly and ?? insinuate should be in  a
state of fear that is absolutely ridiculous, Mr. President. I would also
point out that if you start talking about the importation of guns from
Mexico, we would need look no further than Washington D.C. our own
Attorney General in the Fast and Furious program won that current Obama
administration. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further notices or announcements? Any further business to come
before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Before the motion as short announcement.
Members of the Senate, we are going to do a skeletal session on Monday
evening so that you can extend your Easter weekend and I’m asking the
Committee Chairs not to schedule any Committee meetings on Tuesday
before 10 a.m. so that folks can come in on Tuesday morning as opposed
to coming in on Monday night. And with that, Mr. President, I move that
the Senate do now adjourn subject to the introduction of bills and
resolutions, and the receipt of messages from the House and the
Governor.  To reconvene on Monday April 1, 2013 at 12 p.m. and that will
be a skeletal session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is the Senate do now adjourn subject to the stipulations
stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Monday, April 1 at 12 p.m.
Seconded by Senator Harrington.  All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oppose, no. The ayes have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
