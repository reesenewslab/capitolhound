  In fact, believes in that.  I mean would that be a basis for someone not
to marry an interracial couple?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m unaware of a tenet of faith.  That’s not a tenet of my faith that
racial couples should not be allowed to marry, interracial couples
should to marry, but I would say that the state may have an obligation
to perform any marriage that comes through, depending on how that’s
defined in law, but to force an individual to do something on that basis
is something that I would object to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Hise one further question for clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hise ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So Senator Hise, you’re saying that in terms if someone’s religion said
interracial couples could not marry, you would object to that, but do
you believe that this bill would basically allow someone to opt out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think this, I believe that this bill allows for magistrates to say
that they will perform no marriages for a time period of at least six
months under any circumstances, under any conditions and may begin that
at whatever time they choose, but they may perform no marriages, and I
believe the determination for that is not given.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, just to speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, you have the floor, speak for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think what we have here is a situation where there’s 675 magistrates
in this state; at best, only 7 or 8 have indicated an objection.  We
should not be pandering to 7 or 8 individuals.  I hear about polls.  If
you take in polls 40-50 years ago about school desegregation or what
took place in terms of the integration of public facilities -- that vast
majority of people would have been opposed to it, but the law basically
stated that we had to honor those laws if they were passed, either by
Congress or through the Supreme Court and judicial decisions.
What we have here is a situation where really the Fourth Circuit has
spoken.  Soon the Supreme Court will speak.  Underneath Equal Protection
Clause, gay couples will be sanctioned the right to marriage, regardless
of how we may feel about this individually or as a matter of religious
convictions.  We should not be here today at this hour, trying to
circumvent the law.  We should be about upholding the law.
More importantly, we should be about enforcing the US Constitution
because the US Constitution is the guiding light.  It’s the beacon.  It
is indeed that force which gives each of us the rights that we exercise
in this chamber today but throughout our lives.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any further discussion or debate?  Senator Van Duyn, what
purpose your ayes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Van Duyn, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  What I know about the people in my district is that faith is
at the core of their being and I will defend with every fiber of my
being their right to practice their religion as they choose, but this
bill is not about religion, it is about fairness, it is about equal
protection under the law, and is about working for a North Carolina that
looks forward towards a future where everyone in NC has the opportunity
to live their fullest lives.
Courts throughout this country have ruled that it is wrong to legitimize
discrimination and yet that is what we are about to do today.  I
represent a district that is home to thousands of same sex couples,
families that I know personally and are on my mind today as I speak.
These are people who live every day as second class citizens and all
they want is something that you and I utterly take for granted -- the
freedom to love who you love and be who you are.  Denying them the right
to live their lives as their true selves is not only wrong, but it
stifles our ability to realize our potential.  And it is time for us to
turn this page and say once and for all that North Carolina is moving
forward, that we are open for business, and we welcome unreservedly
everyone who wants to help us build a better future for ourselves and
for our children.
Come visit our beaches and mountains, and bring your family and friends.
 Looking to expand a business?  We want to help you be successful.  We
cannot be that NC if at the same time we allow anyone to feel like they
are second class.

  ...?? to corporations and especially to certain utility businesses.
There was intentions of this body to reduce or show the reflection of
that reduction in the billing statements and pass along the savings to
the consumers. Not everyone did that, and so this bill clarifies that it
was the intent that when we reduced the corporate rate for those
corporations to reduce their rates to their consumers. Section 4 of this
bill clarifies that. Section 24 is a conforming change that has to do
with preventing double taxation for a group of individuals who were
allowed to roll over their Roth IRAs into retirement accounts from one
airline under the 2012 federal act. This part of the bill is reasonably
time sensitive because it goes through October 15 of this year. What we
are doing in this section of the bill is we are simply conforming with
the federal rule that allows these people to take that deduction. So, if
there are any questions, I will be happy to attempt to answer them. It
is straightforward and again and in the words of our esteemed Senator
Hartsell: it is a technical, it is a technical bill. Thank you. Thank
you all, and I&#39;m here to answer your questions if you have any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis...your rights?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Rucho would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Rucho, I&#39;m a little unclear on
this Dominion Energy issue. Would you clarify that a little bit for me,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, thank you, Senator Davis. Good question. Senator Rabin and his
explanation talked about this issue and the intent of the General
Assembly in passing this bill and trying to simplify the utilities&#39;
bills to our consumers was to reflect the reduction in the amount of
sales tax so that their bill would be basically a revenue neutral bill.
And, fortunately, nearly every one of the utilities, both electric and
gas, supported our intent, and actually returned the over collected
corporate income tax, which was achieved because of what we accomplished
the previous year in lowering the ?? or CIT in January of &#39;14. And,
in doing so, they all complied. The only one of those corporations that
chose not to participate, and do what they should have done as a good
corporate citizen, was Dominion Energy. And so what this does, is it
basically provides clarity to allow the utility commission and the
public staff which talked yesterday about this issue, and actually
supports the direction we are trying to move, so again: providing
clarity to allow every corporation to understand that if we do give a
CIT cut, especially in a regulated industry, there has to be a reduction
in the amount - on the rate - for the consumer. That should explain it.
Thank you.

  Senator Jackson started that out the other day. So I&#39;ve decided to
have a little fun with this. Members, I&#39;m happy and pleased to be
before you today to speak before you on this bill. I want to thank
Senator Berger and others for their hard work on this effort. We had an
interesting committee meeting yesterday. A lot of good, frank
discussion. A lot of aspects of this bill were discussed and presented.
A lot of the false assumptions of what this bill were about were
dispelled yesterday, but not everybody had the benefit of that committee
meeting, and not everybody can get accurate reporting from the news, so
I&#39;m going to go over the bill with you briefly, and after that, of
course, I&#39;ll be happy to answer questions. Senate bill 2 would
establish procedures by which magistrates can be recused from performing
all lawful marriages and assistant and deputy registers of deeds can be
recused from issuing all lawful marriage licenses based upon any
sincerely held religious objection. The recusal would be for a minimum
of six months and would continue until the recusal is rescinded in
writing. Officials who so recuse themselves would not be subject to
prosecution for failing to perform the duties imposed upon them by law.
So let me touch on this for just a minute. These are the key points that
I think that folks need to take away from this bill. Senate bill 2 will
ensure that religious freedom for North Carolina&#39;s magistrates and
the employees of the Register of Deeds is preserved through state law.
Now let&#39;s be frank. While the federal court decision in October,
which violated the principles of federalism, has thrown us a curveball,
and we need to establish a framework under which reasonable
accommodation for sincerely held religious beliefs can be done, can be
accommodated. This, by the way, is required by the First Amendment of
the US Constitution, it&#39;s required under the North Carolina
Constitution, and it&#39;s required under several different federal
laws, including Title VII. Now, I&#39;d like to take a moment to remind
members of the oath that we took. I would like to read from our North
Carolina Constitution. First I&#39;d like to read to you the Preamble,
which if you haven&#39;t read it lately, you probably ought to. It
reads, &quot;We the people of the state of North Carolina, grateful to
Almighty God, sovereign ruler of nations, for the preservation of the
American Union, and the existence of our civil, political, and religious
liberties, and acknowledging our dependence upon him for the continuance
of those blessings to us and our posterity, do for the more certain
security thereof, and for the better government of the state, ordain and
establish this constitution.&quot; And the Constitution goes on in
Article One, Section 13. And I quote, &quot;All persons have a natural
and inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates
of their own consciences, and no human authority shall in any case
whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience.&quot; Now
following these court orders that came down in October, the
Administrative Office of the Courts sent a letter purporting to give
guidance to court personnel, and really giving direction on what they
are to do following this development. After receiving this letter, a
number of magistrates resigned their positions. Why did they do that?
Why did they resign after receiving this letter? For those of you who
haven&#39;t read it, you probably should go read the letter. I have a
copy. If it&#39;s necessary today, I&#39;ll read it to you if it comes
to that. But in this letter they were informed that they could be
subject to criminal prosecution, criminal prosecution for declining to
participate in these court-ordered marriage ceremonies to which they
held a sincere religious objection.

  <p id="030:00">
  Now the legal advise that was reported to be given in this letter was
clearly erroneous. Taking no regard for the first amendment, our
constitution, or federal law and due to that misleading advise a number
of us in this body wrote a letter to the director of AOC communicating
with him, requesting him to correct this letter. He refused to do so.
The proper legal analysis was clearly stated to him and he refused to do
so. Why do I bring up this letter? I bring it up to you because it falls
to us to correct this inaction by the AOC this inability to even try to
use common sense. To try to accommodate people&#39;s sincere religious
beliefs and the free exercise thereof.
Since the foundation of this country we have respected religious
liberty. It is a basic principal of this nation and of this state as I
stated in our state constitution and of course we&#39;re all familiar
with the US Constitution and many of us have read many cases over the
years where the courts have construed may of our first amendment rights.
So these magistrates have resigned. Several have filed lawsuits on their
civil rights. Quite frankly I&#39;m sure it is going to end up costing
the state of North Carolina quite a bit of change because AOC could not
take care of their own business. Common sense would allow these folks to
be able to recuse themselves. There are plenty of people who are willing
to perform these ceremonies but no, it&#39;s fallen to us. So Senate
Bill two is a result of this effort that we have made to try to find the
right ground to balance what we all know to be our basic rights against
this newly discovered, this newly discovered  idea of what marriage is
that we somehow haven&#39;t been able to find for two hundred years but
some very intelligent federal judges that are smarter than the rest of
us have somehow found it for us.
So we must figure out how to handle this as a state, as legislators we
must find a way to balance these concerns. We must comply with valid
court orders if that&#39;s the ultimate decision of the Supreme Court of
the United States and it may be, I concede it may be, we&#39;ll have to
learn how to deal with this. That&#39;s what part of this bill,
that&#39;s what this bill in part is all about. How do we balance what
we know to be our first amendment rights quite frankly, probably a
majority of North Carolinian&#39;s first amendment rights, and yet still
comply with these court orders. We must comply, I can see that we must
comply. So let&#39;s be clear about this. This legislation prohibits any
couples of whatever orientation they may have from being treated
differently. A heterosexual couple who&#39;s entitled to seek a marriage
license and have a civil ceremony before a magistrate will be treated
just the same as a heterosexual couple that&#39;s entitled to that.
There will be no difference, this bill ensures that. There will be no
difference. That magistrate who chooses to recuse them self, they will
not be able to pick and choose. They will not be able to say
&quot;I&#39;ll do it for this heterosexual couple but I won&#39;t do it
for the homosexual couple&quot;. They will not have that choice. They
will either perform marriages or they will not. They will either issue
licences in the register of deeds or they will not. That&#39;s what this
bill says. This bill is about protecting religious

  freedom and doing so in a way that these court orders can be carried
out. Colleagues, the protections under the First Amendment are well
established. They&#39;re well established again under the First
Amendment of the US Constitution, the North Carolina Constitution, and a
variety of federal laws. We must, we must, we must, we must find the
right course to be able to balance these conflicts. We must find the
right way to do that. We may not trample upon the rights that we all
know to be true and dear to our hearts, and that of religious freedom,
because of the whims and dictates of a few. We must find a way to do
this. That&#39;s why I am pleased to be here to support this bill and
speak on it. People should not have to choose between their faith and
their jobs. This bill addresses this. This concrete problem, this
problem that is before us today, that was thrust upon us by the
inability of the Administrative Office of the Courts to just even have a
common sense in the office arrangement about figuring out who&#39;s
willing to do it and who can&#39;t. With this fundamental change, we
must take steps to ensure these constitutionally protected rights of
religious freedom is not stripped away because of these federal
courts&#39; action. I commend the bill to you, and I&#39;m happy to take
any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senators, I&#39;d like to recognize that Senator Pate
is back in the chamber. Is there any discussion or debate? Senator
Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate,
public service, public service. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any higher
calling. It&#39;s rewarding, uplifting, ennobling. It is why each of us
is here and does what we do. As a public servant, I represent all the
people in my district: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Atheists,
Agnostics, whatever religion they have, Black, White, Brown, Tan, male,
female, Democrat, Republican, Independent, able-bodied, disabled, gay,
straight, all of them. I do not, we do not have the right to pick and
choose whom we serve of the public. It&#39;s called public service. We
don&#39;t get to select whom we want to help. It&#39;s public service,
not selective service. This bill offends this fundamental notion of
public service in a very particular way. It gives special rights to two
categories of state employees, magistrates and assistant registrars of
deeds, as it relates to a single job function, the performance of civil
marriages of gay people. These positions are officers of the court and
agents of the state. In fact, the magistrate must take and subscribe to
the following oath: I do solemnly and sincerely swear that I will
support the Constitution of the United States. That&#39;s it. It
doesn&#39;t then put in a caveat saying, &quot;Well, except for those
parts of the Constitution that displease me.&quot; Let&#39;s consider
the consequences if we pass this bill. If you are sincere about your
motivations for this bill and it gets enacted, there is absolutely no
rational reason to stop here. No reason. If a clerk at the Department of
Revenue is opposed to gay marriage, and he believes that processing a
tax return for a

  <p id="040:00">
  … gay couple, married filing jointly is contrary to his religion, you
must allow that person the right to refuse to process that tax return or
else, according to your logic, you are discriminating against that
person. You must similarly allow a ticket taker at the North Carolina
Zoo of a gay couple with children to refuse to sell a family pass to
those people as they walk through the door, or you are discriminating
against that ticket taker. For that matter why should a County Health
Department nurse be required to consult with the gay spouse of a sick
person? You are offending them to force them to do so. Why would a
school administrator who refuses to enroll the child of a gay married
couple. Why can’t they do that? A DMV clerk should be able to refuse to
provide a new driver’s license to a gay married person who wants to
change the last name to that of her spouse, if you believe what you say
you believe. The list could go on for as long as we think of any
government service provided to the people of North Carolina, because of
your logic you’re discriminating against these people’s religious
beliefs. If you deny them the right to discriminate against gay people.
Gay married people. In fact, all these public servants I&#39;ve just
described actually have an arguably stronger argument than the
magistrates because they’re not forced to swear to uphold the
Constitution like the officer of the court, like a magistrate does. Not
only is there no rational reason to stop and limit this bill, to
discriminating for magistrates and assistant register’s deeds, there’s
no rational reason to limit it to State employee’s targets of their
discrimination of gay people. It should open up the flood gates to any
form of discrimination that offends someone’s beliefs. If a public
servant, an after school public school teacher, has a sincerely held
religious belief against having child out of wedlock they should be able
to refuse to interact with a parent, a single mom, who is unmarried. A
teacher who does not believe in evolution should have the right to
refuse to follow the curriculum or else we are discriminating against
that teacher and their sincerely held religious beliefs. What about a
County nurse who believes that contraception is immoral and contrary to
their faith? Should they have the right to deny to provide contraception
to a heterosexual married person? Can you not see that this bill takes
us down a road that we must not go? Passing this bill will, in fact,
embolden other public servants to pick and choose who and when they
perform their job. They will choose to deny to serve the very people
whose taxes it is that pays their salaries, and whose obligation it is
to provide services to the people.
My final point is that this bill, Senate Bill 2, right up at the top,
top priority for this session, for this chamber, shines the absolute
wrong spotlight on our state. We live in such an insanely competitive
world. We are struggling and clawing to get whatever kind of economic
activity we can here in North Carolina. We have a lot of debates about
the best way to do that, but I assure you this is not the best way to do
that. The North Carolina brand is important to attracting businesses,
entrepreneurs, talented workers, innovators, entities and people who
have choices about where they want to locate. With this bill, we are
putting ourselves in league with Alabama as the states that refuse to
respect the Constitution. What signal are we sending? How is Apple, with
its gay CEO, gonna look at North Carolina if we move this bill forward?
Will he see North Carolina as a forward thinking creative state that’s
open for business? Or will he see a state that clings to divisive,
social battles even after other folks have moved. And by the way, the
people of North Carolina have moved on.

  70% of North Carolina think that now that gay marriage is legal, it has
had no impact on their life, and that includes a majority of Republican
people in North Carolina. Our social divisions are healing, yet this
bill rips the scab right off. Like a laser, we should be focusing on
creating jobs, improving economic conditions, strengthening education,

prosecutors or district attorneys in this state that have a religious
objection to the death penalty, do you force them to prosecute those
cases for the death penalty?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are jobs which by definition have discretion in terms of how
they&#39;re implemented. When a particular case comes before a district
attorney, they evaluate what is the evidence, what is the nature of the
crime, and then they choose what charge to bring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify that, are they allowed to recuse themselves and not
prosecute a case for the death penalty?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, I don&#39;t know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have quite a few concerns about this bill. First, it&#39;s
distasteful, it&#39;s offensive, and it&#39;s bad public policy, because
what we&#39;re trying to do is to lawfully allow public employees to
discriminate against gay couples. As legislators, we should be
constructively involved in upholding the law, not being crafty in coming
up with means that allow people to discriminate and to circumvent the
law. The fourth circuit has spoken. North Carolina is within the fourth
circuit. United States court of appeals. Gay marriage is now allowed in
this state. The administrative office of the court has spoken and
indicated what magistrates have an obligation to do when they take that
oath of office. We should be backing up the fourth circuit. We should be
backing up the administrative office of the court, not sitting back and
using our constructive energies to circumvent the law. It&#39;s the
wrong thing to do. It&#39;s bad public policy. It makes me wonder what
we might have done back in the 1950s when school desegregation was a
major concern before Brown versus board of education or shortly after
then and integrated the public school system. If we had teachers that
didn&#39;t want to teach African American students, if we had principals
that don&#39;t want to officiate in the schools that had them, would we
had somehow come up with a law that would have allowed them to opt out?
I would hope not. And if there had been a snack bar down at the local
courthouse where previously, African Americans couldn&#39;t be served,
but they were government employees and because of their religious
convictions and beliefs we didn&#39;t feel they had to after the law had
changed, would we have sat back and come up with a crafty law to allow
them out? I would hope not. And before Loving versus Virginia, the
supreme court case that allowed for mix race couples to marry that smote
down all of those laws that prohibit it, would we have come up with a
law to exempted the magistrates and to exempted those that are in the
registered deeds offices offering marriage licenses to do it because
they had religious convictions against mixed race couples? I would hope
not. The law has changed. I ask you to put your personal thoughts aside,
your personal objections aside. We took an oath to uphold the law. We
took an oath to make certain that all people in this state have these
equal rights and opportunities, and those rights extend to gay couples.
We want to be on the right side of history. We want to be judged in a
way that&#39;s most appropriate. So a decade from now, when your
grandchildren look back and try to see whether you were a part of a
force that basically went out and tried to craft a law to allow
discrimination, if that was the right thing to do

  We already were the last state to pass a constitutional amendment that
prohibited gay marriages. Less than two years have passed. We&#39;re on
the wrong side of history. Do we really want to now, at this point in
time, as Senator Stein said, you know, I guarantee yesterday the
Secretary of Commerce in the Commerce Committee talking about how
competitive it is to get jobs and opportunities. North Carolina has had
a state and a reputation for being a state that&#39;s progressive, a
state that&#39;s inclusive. At a point in time in the South when you had
governors like Lester Maddox down in Georgia and George Wallace down in
Alabama, we had good governors here in North Carolina. We had folks like
Terry Sanford. We had people like Jim Holzhowzer. People like Governor
Martin. People like Jim Hunt. We were known for being inclusive. We were
known for being transformative. We were known for being at the cutting
edge. We were known for being that state in the South that regardless of
what the other states were doing, regardless of what was going on,
business was welcome. We need to make certain that regardless of
one&#39;s race, one&#39;s religious convictions, one&#39;s sexual
orientation, that businesses and citizens are welcome in this state.
That we&#39;re not a state that will go back and craft clever bills to
lawfully allow for discrimination. It&#39;s the wrong thing to do.
It&#39;s bad public policy and history will not treat us well if we
continue to move along this step. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tarte, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tarte has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Of all the days and all the
opportunities to stand up and speak, this would be the one bill I would
really not like to talk about. I am about to step out on an island by
myself and I&#39;m going to share my thoughts and views a little bit,
not so much to try to persuade somebody to take a position one way or
another, not to talk on the position of one person&#39;s view or point
of view is right or wrong because this is a very difficult topic. This
is really a balance between religious beliefs and the law and your
beliefs about the law for me, and I&#39;ve done some homework on this.
First of all, just as background, I&#39;m a Methodist. Our church takes
a position on same sex marriage. We ban it, we do not allow it. Our
bishop has ruled if an ordained minister participates in they will be
banned and sanctioned in the church. The tough topic, we in our
congregation, our pastor talked about this whole issue about four weeks
ago on crucial conversations, it&#39;s tough, is splits the church.
It&#39;s divided churches on this topic. I have a little bit of a unique
position as I speak before you today in that I have the authority to
perform marriages. I marry people, and I will tell you flat out, my
definition of marriage is in support of Amendment 1. I believe marriage
and as I&#39;ve been taught is the holy vow taken between a single man
and a single woman as a sacrament with God, and I uphold and I believe
that. I personally would not and will not marry people of the same sex.
That&#39;s my religious foundation and belief, but what we&#39;ve
crossed into also is the rule of law, and I&#39;ve done my homework
talking to judges at all levels, the highest levels down to other
magistrates and chief magistrates about this issue, and in that research
we&#39;ve talked about some, and I&#39;m not an attorney, but the
components of the law, constitutionality is an issue that we talked, and
based on the homework I&#39;ve done I think this will actually be a
constitutional law and withstand that scrutiny. We talk about the oath
and administering and adhering to the oath and office, it&#39;s a
consideration. Equality is that cornerstone of our constitution and
it&#39;s a cornerstone of how we treat people around this issue, and
last, and maybe more importantly for this bill which gives it I think
great stature is accommodation. I think there is an importance in
accommodating people&#39;s religious beliefs and adhering to their first
amendment rights, and the ability to accommodate that as long as
we&#39;re not prejudicing or stepping on the rights of other
individuals. But with that said, I think there&#39;s also the, we set
precedents, and that&#39;s what the law is about. There&#39;s also
something as simple as the reasonable man test

  and I worry if we substitute same-sex marriage, would we interpret that
law the same way or differently from a reasonable person&#39;s test of
the law based on the statute how we&#39;re writing it right now? Couple
last thoughts I will leave you with is talking with one chief
magistrate. The interesting comment that that person made to me was the
final instructions, and I&#39;m going to paraphrase, that judges often
do to juries. And basically the comment is, you must interpret and
follow the law as I instruct you, not as you want the law to be. The law
is on the books currently. I think we have an obligation to both adhere
to that same instruction as we instruct jurors and citizens to follow
the law. I think about this one bothers me, keeps me up at night. One
gentleman, Herman Hamilton, in my adult Sunday school class for the last
20 years, recently passed away. He was the assistant district attorney
who prosecuted Rosa Parks. Up until the point of him passing away last
year, he refused to talk about it. There is a right and a wrong. I&#39;m
not here to pass judgment and not make you think one way or the other,
just something that we have to consider as we move forward. What the
chief magistrate also told me, which is the reason I&#39;m going to vote
against this bill, and doesn&#39;t give me any pride to do that in any
way, shape, or form, it goes in some way against my religious beliefs,
but the need to protect the rule of law, is that the magistrate, the
chief magistrates believe they already have within their ability to
handle this issue within scheduling, to accommodate those that need to
be accommodated. They don&#39;t necessarily need this legislation to do
that. And I recognize there&#39;s issues with rural magistrate offices.
This is not perfect. Life isn&#39;t perfect in any way. But the last
thing around the magistrates was an interesting perspective. They
can&#39;t be fired. They can only be impeached, and they thought the
easiest way to do this is just make this offense, if you wanted to call
it an offense, or inability to execute on this, a non-impeachable item,
and then it would resolve the matter without all the issues that
we&#39;re trying to do, and still protect the First Amendment rights,
protect religious freedoms, and yet give the flexibility to the
magistrate&#39;s office. So, with that, I think it&#39;s a balance
between accommodation and trying to do the right thing, which I
absolutely believe the bill&#39;s trying to do that, and all my
colleagues are trying to do. Balancing it with the rule of law, and
following the law, and not setting bad precedents. I love each of you.
We&#39;re all God&#39;s children. I don&#39;t know what the right answer
is. This keeps me up at night like you cannot believe. I wish in some
ways we could all just hug each other and love each other and recognize
that, as God instructs us. I don&#39;t live in the Old Testament, I live
in the New, and Christ is about love, and this is about trying to do the
right thing. I thank you for tolerating me sharing my thoughts on this.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Smith, for what purpose do you rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Smith, you have the floor to speak to the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As a freshman in this august body, I was looking
forward to coming here to work on issues that are important to the
citizens of North Carolina, like jobs and education. Instead, the first
bill introduced into this chamber is a socially divisive bill, blatantly
discriminatory, and will surely be challenged in court, costing the
taxpayers of North Carolina money to defend it. It seems to me that if
you were a magistrate, you took an oath to uphold the duties of that
office, and if you now feel that you cannot do that, you should resign
your office and look for other employment. I would urge you to vote
against this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Randleman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Randleman has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and Gentlemen, for
two days I have sat and listened to members talk about magistrates. As a
former clerk of superior court, I feel I am most qualified to speak on
the issue of magistrates. As a clerk I interviewed applicants, I
submitted nominations for prospective magistrates, I on occasion had to
write disciplinary letters involving magistrates, and since magistrates
must be reappointed every four years, I ultimately made the decision
regarding their nomination for reappointment. You&#39;ve heard about six
magistrates who chose to leave their position

  For one reason or another since October. Collectively these magistrates
represent 103 years of experience as a magistrate or in some related
field, experience that cannot be replaced, experience that is also
costly to taxpayers. Magistrates are dedicated public servants. Many
work 24 hour shifts and what, when we are all asleep in our nice, cozy
beds, they are working to keep our community safe. Magistrates are truly
on the front line in providing public safety all across the state of
North Carolina. In honor of these dedicated public servants, past,
present and future, I will be supporting this legislation. Thank you,
Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you
rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you all for your great remarks and to Senator Tarte for his
courage. I also wanted to be clear here that the legislation, at least
it seems to me, is driven by an underlying belief or philosophy that the
people who have religious convictions against gay marriage are better
than, superior to or more valuable than the gay people who are seeking
to be married or others who may be seeking to get married that,
who&#39;s, to whom there might be religious objections. We&#39;re using
an ostensibly non-discriminatory purpose for doing this while to
continue to demean and disparage and stigmatize, particularly the people
seeking gay marriage, by emphasizing the need to protect those who would
be sworn to solemnize those marriages or provide in the case of
registers the licenses, to protect those who would have religious
objections to doing that and we are extending it really to any kind of
marriages beyond gay marriages. Any kind of marriages that might spawn
religious objections, and we&#39;re passing an even more dangerously,
this legislation, not on some neutral palate, but on the cultural
backdrop of extreme polarization in our society around gay marriage,
certain religious groups such as Muslims and perhaps interracial
marriage, there may be lingering prejudice regarding that. All of these
are constitutionally protected groups and activities, so what do we do
here? We are setting up our employees to engage in unconstitutional
activities as this legislation may be applied. I would challenge the
notion that this legislation prohibits different treatment. In fact, it
sets up the potential for different treatment precisely because an
employee can pick and choose the time at which they want to recuse
themselves. Senator Bingham, Magistrate Bingham could marry Jared
Tillman and Trudy Wade and then have a religious conviction when I show
up with Valerie Fushe to have the same ceremony performed, and
there&#39;s nothing in this legislation that would prohibit that and I
have a strong concern about that because of the cultural backdrop and
the polarization we know that is out there. We set up our employees to
engage in this unconstitutional behavior and we open the door to
citizens presenting themselves for a public service they have a right to
have and being demeaned or disparaged or stigmatized as someone might
decide to recuse themselves, or in a small community they might know
that they married somebody 3 hours before, the day before, but somehow
refuse to then marry them. To me this is a huge loophole and it is red
meat that preys upon the prejudice that we know is out there, and
finally we are structurally reducing the access to marriage for everyone
based on our prejudice against those to whom we have the religious
objection by creating this minimum of 10 hours a day so many days a week
that one can access marriage in a jurisdiction. For that reason, those
reasons and others that you have already heard in the chamber, I think
this is a dangerous framework for addressing this issue and as Senator

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Bryant will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, do you yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, I read the statute and I can&#39;t see anywhere in here
where it says somebody could marry someone today and fifteen minutes
later not marry someone, and thirty minutes later marry someone else. Is
it not in this statute that they must recuse themselves from performing
marriages for six months before they can change?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President? Yes. Senator Apodaca, you have to restrain, refrain
from marrying six months after you recuse yourself, but there is no time
frame or time limit for you notifying your superior, the district court
judge or the register of deeds, of your recusal. That can be done at any
time, and then the time runs from when you notify them and that is all
verbal, first of all. It&#39;s not in writing. There&#39;s no official
record of it. It, from what I have seen in the statute, the recusal,
rescinding the recusal is in writing, but recusing yourself is, is
strictly an interpersonal activity between you and your superior.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me, may I ask this. Keep the mic up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, would you, is this a follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, do you yield for a follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know it&#39;s difficult to ask lawyers questions and get straight
answers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes or no? I recuse myself from performing a marriage, today. I must not
marry anyone for six months. Is that true?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are correct on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
However, you can marry somebody today before you recuse yourself or the
hour before you recuse yourself, and then recuse yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, mister President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield, mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, that wasn&#39;t the question. The question was, I decide
not to marry you and Senator Stein for many, many reasons. It
wouldn&#39;t be a good mix for you, at all, but then from that point on,
I can&#39;t marry anyone for six months. Is that not correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, Senator Apodaca. That just wasn&#39;t my point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, Senator Barefoot, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Stein would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A lot of, I&#39;ve heard a few comments made about jobs and the economy,
and Senator Stein, you made one about Apple. And so I&#39;ve got a
question for you. Where is the iPhone made? You can look at yours if.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a shield on mine. Why don&#39;t you answer the question if you
know it, because I don&#39;t.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, mine&#39;s made in China, where most iPhones are made. Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is China&#39;s policy on same sex marriage?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I expect that that is not a country whose policies we want to be
embracing to improve our competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So then why did the Apple CEO send all the manufacturing there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, I am not a member of Apple in terms of its, I&#39;m not a member, I
don&#39;t even own stock in Apple. So I don&#39;t know why Apple sent it
there. I expect because it&#39;s cheaper to make things there, but if
you think that the creative class, these companies whether it&#39;s Red
Hat or Citrix or whatever, are gonna come here because the, we have the
lowest cost employees the way that Apple sends their manufacturing to
China, you&#39;re deluding yourself. They&#39;re coming here because we
have innovative, talented, creative workers, and when you ask those
folks what kind of community they want to live in, they don&#39;t wanna
live in a community that legally tolerates and encourages, in fact,
encourages discrimination of any kind. And that&#39;s what I’m trying to
compete for. Now, as for what does Apple CEO think of this? Apple, I
don&#39;t think, is looking to come and manufacture in North Carolina,
but there are other corporations with gay CEOs that are considering
North Carolina as opposed to Virginia or Massachusetts or Texas or any
other state, and I don&#39;t wanna be out there on a sore thumb or on an
island like Alabama is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I speak to the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just with regards to jobs and the economy, this, this chamber passed the
marriage amendment a few years ago, and we&#39;ve been one of the
leading producers of new jobs in the United States of America.
Apple&#39;s largest manufacturing presence in the world is in a country
that is completely hostile to same sec marriage. And so I submit to you
that some of the comments

I certainly don&#39;t agree. Our First Amendment rights are fundamental

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Stein. I&#39;ve been married for 42
years, which is a real testimony to Judy Salliers, and her patience, but
if I was to decide to marry another woman, or a guy, or two guys, would
that be, would I be considered, would you agree to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would not. And by the way, it&#39;s not lawful, and
the Constitution doesn&#39;t require that the state recognize that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So do you think that&#39;s discrimination against me,
a law-abiding, honorable person?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not believe it&#39;s discrimination because the
Constitution has not been determined to recognize that form of marriage.
If the Supreme Court. No, no, I don&#39;t. I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the answer then is that you would be discriminating
against me for wanting to have one of each or be married to another
person?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In our daily lives we are ?? to make personal choices.
You, everyone of you, us, has the right to join a country club that
doesn&#39;t allow Black people, that doesn&#39;t allow Jewish people,
that doesn&#39;t allow women. We&#39;re allowed to go worship in a
church that doesn&#39;t have any gay people. There is nothing in the
Constitution that requires any pastor, minister, rabbi, imam, anyone to
perform a same-sex marriage. What the Constitution has been ruled,
determined to require is that the state not discriminate between two
consulting adults who want to get married. Who love each other and want
to get married. That&#39;s the law of the land. It&#39;s the state, the
Constitution makes a requirement of the state and what is the state if
not state employees and the civil servants who do that work? That&#39;s
what the Constitution requires. That&#39;s the type of discrimination we
must not tolerate. In terms of your personal beliefs, my personal
beliefs, we&#39;re allowed to believe whatever we want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to thank you, Senator Stein. I&#39;d like
to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, you have the floor to speak to the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, and I

handicapped when it comes to the science. This bill appears to me to be
a way for people who are licensed or authorized to perform marriages in
this state to be able to refuse to endorse a same-sex marriage so long
as they have legitimate religious beliefs, and it appears to me, as
Senator Cooke has said, that that is a basic right that we have as
American citizens to exercise our faith and to have our religious
freedom, so I will be gladly supporting this bill and I thank Senator
Berger for bringing it forward. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask
Senator Newton a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, is the
state obligated, does the state have to provide the service of providing
marriages. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s obligated to
do that, it&#39;s currently the law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator do you yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We can debate, Senator
Newton, I guess whether the state has to perform this service for our
citizens or not, but since we do currently and under this bill is there
any person or any couple that would be denied the service of having
their marriage performed if they were to come to the courthouse for that
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me answer your question two ways. I want
to try not to violate Senator Apodaca&#39;s rule of not giving a
straight answer. Yes, there are people, for example, that would not be
able to be married even if they&#39;re heterosexual. A father and a
daughter couldn&#39;t get married. A man could not marry a woman who was
married to another man. A man couldn&#39;t marry his aunt. Aunt
couldn&#39;t marry her nephew. We&#39;re not even talking about the
homosexual marriages, so clearly at least for now we have some standards
about who could be married and who can&#39;t. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Senator Newton. I&#39;d like to ask Senator Barefoot a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barefoot, do you yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Barefoot, you
mentioned I guess one reason why a corporation with a social conscience
might not want to locate its manufacturing facilities in China
considering China&#39;s environmental policies, their life policies and
any other social policies they might have. Can you think of one reason
why a socially conscious corporation would want to locate in China?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I don&#39;t know the answer to that,
but what I do know is that Senator Stine said that we&#39;re getting
close to looking like Alabama and Alabama has three auto manufacturers,
Mercedes, Honda and Hyundai. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator
Barefoot. I&#39;d like to speak to the bill, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Daniel you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to take us back to 2011 for a moment when
we began considering whether to put the marriage amendment on the ballot
or not and the argument we heard against it was well, we&#39;ve got a
defense of marriage law, we don&#39;t need a marriage amendment. Well,
at the time our argument against that, or at least my argument against
it was we had seen what happened in other states, how readily Federal
judges would strike down state defense of marriage laws and I guess our
thinking at the time, my thinking at the time was surely if the people
of North Carolina vote on a constitutional amendment, an amendment of
our constitution to define marriage as being between one man and one
woman that those esteemed individuals that have been appointed to the
Federal bench would respect, if they didn&#39;t respect the will of the
voters through their elected officials, through constitutionally
established laws, then surely they would respect the constitutions of 31
states whose voters have gone to the polls and chosen to have
traditional marriage amendments added to their constitutions. How wrong
I was, how wrong we were.

  <p id="080:00">
  To believe that that was true, and I think this whole debate today shows
the chaos that the federal bench is creating across this country for the
simple reason that they refuse to respect the will of 50 million voters
across this country. And this is just the beginning of the debates that
we&#39;re gonna have on these type issues when what I call lawyers in a
black robe decide that they want to be super legislators and as Senator
Newton said yesterday in the committee, they think they know better than
God, and they certainly think they know better than, than the American
people and the North Carolina people. So we&#39;re here today because
two lawyers in a black robe sitting in a court in Richmond decided in a
two to one vote that North Carolina shouldn&#39;t have a marriage
amendment. And I, I&#39;m afraid where this is gonna go in the future.
We see it all across the country where if, if you refuse to comply in
your business with the mandates of the court, and the other side just
says well, we&#39;ll show you. We&#39;ll take your house. We&#39;ll take
your property. We&#39;ll take everything you&#39;ve worked a lifetime to
earn away from you. Now I guess I&#39;m getting a little bit, somebody
could probably object. I&#39;m getting far afield from this bill, but to
bring it back to where Senator Newton started, this is one bill to solve
one simple issue. Whether the right of conscience of our, of a couple of
classes of state employees should be honored, no one will be denied the
right to be married in a, in a North Carolina courthouse unless one of
the examples that Senator Newton mentioned arises. So I urge you to
support the bill. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Senator Jackson, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it&#39;s a tremendous credit to this body that our debate today
has remained as substantive and civil as it has. We are struggling with
the moral issue while the ground of social change is shifting beneath
our feet. I think we all accept that there are a multitude of deeply
held, conflicting views on this topic, and yet the tone of mutual
respect despite those differences has permeated this discussion.
Y&#39;all have even been nice enough to toss some softballs to Senator
Stein, give him some batting practice. He appreciates that. From a
purely constitutional point of view, however, this bill is caught
between a rock and a hard place. Specifically, it&#39;s caught between
the fourteenth and the fifth amendments. The potential effect of this
bill is very broad. It includes protection for magistrates who exempt
themselves from any marriage in which they sincerely object on religious
grounds. Any marriages. Not just same sex marriages. If this bill
becomes law, it will be legal for magistrates to refuse to perform
interracial marriages. If this bill becomes law, it will be legal for
magistrates to refuse to perform interfaith marriages. If this bill
becomes law, a magistrate can perform a marriage for a white couple,
then ten minutes later an interracial couple can walk in the door and
the magistrate can refuse, and the six month waiting period would begin
as Senator Bryant pointed out. That can happen under this law. And
here&#39;s where the fourteenth amendment comes in. Race and religion
are protected classes, and that level of discrimination will be
subjected to strict scrutiny. You won&#39;t find a legal scholar in the
country who thinks this bill can survive strict scrutiny. If strict
scrutiny is applied to this bill, it fails. That&#39;s the fourteenth
amendment. Now the defense, as some will say, is that this isn&#39;t
about interracial marriage, and it isn&#39;t about interfaith marriage.
This is about same sex marriage. The problem is that in singling out the
true purpose of this bill, as applying specifically to same sex
marriage, you violate the fifth amendment. Here&#39;s a quote. The legal
differentiation
  </p>

  <p id="085:00">
  ...demeans the couple whose moral and sexual choices the constitution
protects, and whose relationship the state has sought to dignify.  And
it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same sex
couples.  The law in question makes it even more difficult for the
children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family
and it’s concord with other families in their community and in their
daily lives.  No legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to
disparage and to injure those whom the state by its marriage laws sought
to protect in personhood and dignity.  That’s a tough quote for this
bill.
And the quote would be easier to dismiss if it weren’t for the fact that
it comes from Justice Kennedy writing for the majority and the Supreme
Court’s decision to overturn the federal government’s prohibition on
same sex marriage.
And what he’s saying, the cliff notes are the Fifth Amendment rejects
any law whose principle effect is singling out same sex couples for
different treatment...even if there’s another legitimate purpose.  And
that’s the crux of it.  Kennedy recognizes this religious objection may
be a legitimate purpose, but it doesn’t outweigh singling out same sex
couples for different treatment under the law.
That balance that we’re all talking about has already taken place at the
level of the Supreme Court.  And according to the Supreme Court, it is
too high a price to pay for laws that have the effect of singling out
same sex couples and ultimately treating them in a way that is
humiliating.
Either this law violates the Fourteenth Amendment or it violates the
Fifth Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Woodward, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Woodward has the floor.  Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
In the shortened time that we’ve been here because of weather, we
haven’t spent time on the things I was hoping we’d spend more time on
during this session -- strengthening our economy, better educating our
children, providing healthcare to our elderly, veterans, the poor, the
infirmed.  And if we’re gonna shorten our crossover date by a week,
which I think is a good idea actually, then we’re gonna have even less
time to discuss those important issues I think our constituents sent us
here to discuss and to work on.
But instead, we’re taking up one of our top priorities, Senate Bill 2,
a divisive social issue, which is only gonna lead to contentious and
costly court battles.  We can see it coming.  Sen. Jackson just pointed
out a few of those points that we’re gonna see, particularly the issues
of message.  We often blur the lines between a definition of religious
marriage and the definition of civil marriage.
Yesterday in committee, Sen. Newton shared with us his deep felt belief,
and we’ve heard other senators, Sen. Clark, Sen. Davis and others today,
their deeply held beliefs that marriage is ordained by God to be between
one man and one woman.  Many of you in this chamber share that belief
and millions of North Carolinians share that belief.  There are also
millions of other North Carolinians, people of faith, including me, who
have different but equally held deep religious convictions about what
marriage should be.
When a couple stands before their pastor, their minister, their priest,
their rabbi at the altar, under a chuppah or on a sandy beach, they are
exercising their religious belief in marriage.  And it’s being performed
by an efficient who shares their belief, their values.
When a couple stands at the counter at the County Register of Deeds or
before a magistrate and presents no legal objection to the marriage, no
legal obstacle, they have an expectation to receive a legal civil
marriage, performed by an efficient, sworn to protect the constitution,
all of the constitution without regard to his or her personal beliefs.

We have had some conversation about that and we appropriate to place
legal obstacles to civil marriage now age, blood relations but gender is
not one of those obstacles now, it’s been debated in this chamber, it’s
been voted on by the citizens of North Carolina, and it’s been litigated
in our highest courts, and it continues to be litigated in our highest
courts. The gender is not a legal obstacle to marriage in this state
now. Senate Bill 2 continues to blow the lines between the religious
definition of marriage and the legal-civil definition of marriage. Now,
it is I have to confess articulately written bill that makes an
inarticulate policy of that masks and the inarticulate policy of
separate but equal. To avoid the discrimination, degradation, and
stigmatization same sex couples will encounter when a public official
refuses to issue a license or solemnize their legal marriage. This bill,
to do that this bill minimizes all legal civil ceremonies. Reducing them
to inconvenient times forcing them on to elected officials causing
disruption and busy offices and court schedules, it is an inadequate
public accommodation. Senate Jackson went through some of the legal
arguments with this and I believe they will be litigated at length and a
great cause the tax payers of North Carolina if we pass it but it does
speak and there are serious issues about separate but equal under this
bill. On public buses everybody could always ride the bus, it’s just
that some folks had deeply held beliefs but there are some people who
needed to sit in the back of the bus for many years, when it comes to
legal-civil marriage this bill puts everyone in the back of the bus.

certainly religious principles, I sued and I think I would win, you

  What are they? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m missing this question. If we can
move ?? to the bill… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want
to remind the members of the rules, and let’s get on task here and move
forward please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s keep our questions directly
related to the bill at hand please, Senator Smith-Ingram. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you have a follow-up - [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Point well-taken, and it is related, if you’ll allow me to
continue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, if your next question’s directly
related to the bill, then we can continue with that question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’ll conclude that. May I speak to the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to speak to the bill, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
answer to the last question is that you must have an upper limit and a
lower limit. There must be a boundary. Now I am not an attorney. I am a
mathematician, I am a math teacher and I am a science teacher. I am a
physics teacher who teaches both intelligent design, creationism, as
well as the big bang theory. I’m a mathematician who understands that
when you evaluate any object, you must do it within boundaries. Because
I am not a lawyer, I want to speak to the floodgates that this bill
appears to open up from the perspective of a layperson. The Fourth
Circuit Court and we have already maintained here that knowledge is a
fundamental right. All fundamental rights, as my legal counterparts have
shared, are subject to strict scrutiny. As we are debating this bill, we
must look at how we cannot overcome that hurdle of sharing a compelling
government interest. I will tell you what I’m interested in. In my
district, we just had a merger of District 6a and 6b into one district,
and that’s District 6. In that merger, two judges were terminated, so
now there are four judges who have to do the job of six judges. I have
spoken to several judges; I have spoken to several magistrates. I love
the accommodation of the bill, Senator Berger, and that it will allow…
if all the magistrates should recuse themselves, it would allow
marriages, civil ceremonies to still be performed by the district court
judge or the chief judge, but the accommodation is problematic in that
it creates a scheduling nightmare. The judges are already overburdened
with responsibilities, and you’re asking four judges now who are doing
the jobs of six judges, and should all the magistrates recuse
themselves, now they have to add this responsibility of performing
same-sex and opposite-sex marriages. The efficiency and the amount of
cost has not been evaluated within the limits. The last thing that
strikes me about this bill is that as a licensed or ordained
clergywoman, Senator Tarte, who is firm in my faith beliefs and my
tenants, Senator Cook, I believe that my religious freedom, my religious
beliefs should be respected, but the person that I served always
extended himself to those who were in the marginalized communities. He
went out to those who society and the law said were wrong. He spoke to a
woman one day who the law said broke a law and deserved to be stoned,
but yet he extended himself to her. I believe that in religious freedom,
we have that right, but there are also others who have rights that we
need to accommodate, and for many reasons, this bill does not do that. I
will not be supporting this bill, not because I don’t believe a
magistrate has the right to recuse themselves, not because I don’t
believe in same-sex marriages. I oppose this bill because I believe that
we do not try to

Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise has the floor. Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I&#39;d appreciate to give something more than
mathematical interpretation on this bill that&#39;s coming forward. One
of those things that I do bring with me is my faith. I want to speak on
issues here and I want to get to the heart of what I think this bill is
about. I think to say it&#39;s about gay marriage is a cover. This is
about people of faith being driven out of public service. This is about
saying &quot;Because of the faith I have, I can&#39;t serve&quot;.
I&#39;ll be honest with you, I had a lot of conversations, represent six
counties with clerk reports, registry deeds. While they were celebrating
in Buncombe County when this came down, I didn&#39;t know that the
courthouse would open the next day in several counties. This has broad
support across North Carolina. I had counties where all the Magistrates
said they were leaving office because they refused to do it and because
they&#39;ve been targeted. They&#39;ve been told by couples that they
were going to be the one who was forced to marry them. We have reached a
dangerous place in this decision. There&#39;s examples all through the
scripture where the government is asking people to bend their knee to
service to ??, to service to idols...to something inconsistent with
their faith. We have singled out here Magistrates and Assistant Register
of Deeds and said &#39;we have given you some protection from
that.&quot; There may come a day where, because of my faith, I&#39;m not
allowed to serve in the general assembly or in my other capacities.
That&#39;s the direction I see society moving in as a whole but I will
take every step and make every fight along that way to make sure that
that is not the direction we continue to go in as a government. This is
one step in that direction - to offer those protections but I believe
firmly that any individual of faith should have the right to express
their religions feelings and beliefs and not be imposed upon by
government, even when that government  is their employer, to give up on
what they believe and bow their knee to something they do not believe.
Thank you.

Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?

See if Senator Hise will yield for a request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, I believe based upon the information I heard ?? yesterday
that there are 675 Magistrates in the state but there&#39;s only been
about 7 or 8 that have basically said they would not participate in
these gay marriage ceremonies. Now you mention there had been a mass
exodus or a mass exodus is on the wing of occurring. Could you tell me
more about that? Because I&#39;ve not heard about a mass exodus.
I&#39;ve only heard about 7 or 8 individuals which is a very very minute
number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please Respond
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. They have not left their jobs. They have
continued and I have said to their supervisors...they have supervisors
who have said they will not yet accept resignations on that behalf but I
also say that they&#39;ve been told that protections are coming. We made
very sure to say this was an early bill. Why? Because those protections
are coming for individuals that they cannot be discriminated against or
terminated or charged legally, as the AOC has indicated, for making
those positions and because we are offering those protections, there are
many who have not left the position and have not been faced with that
situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, could I ask Senator Hise an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, you mention religious conviction as being the basis for
not performing gay marriages in particular but suppose a person&#39;s
religious conviction said they were opposed to interracial marriages and
I know of a church that...

  <p id="105:00">
  Fact believes in that. I mean, would that be a basis for someone not to
marry an interracial couple? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I&#39;m
unaware of the tenet of faith. That&#39;s not a tenet of my faith that
racial couples should not be allowed to marry, interracial couples
should not be allowed to marry, but I would say that the state may have
an obligation to perform any marriage that comes through depending on
how that&#39;s defined by law, but to force someone to do something on
that basis is something I would object to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I ask
Senator Hise just one further question for clarification. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield, I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So, Senator Hise,
you&#39;re saying that in terms of if someone&#39;s religion said
interracial couples could not marry, you would object to that, but do
you believe that this bill would basically allow someone to opt out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I believe this bill allows for magistrates to say that they
will perform no marriages for a time period of at least six months under
any circumstances, under any conditions, and they begin that at whatever
time they choose, but they may perform no marriages and I believe the
determination for that is not given. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President,
just to speak briefly on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick,
you have the floor to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think what
we have here is a situation where there are 675 magistrates in this
state, at best there are only 7 or 8 who are basically indicate an
objection. We should not be pandering to 7 or 8 individuals. I hear
about polls. If you take in polls 40, 50 years ago about school
desegregation or what took place in terms of the integration of public
facilities, the vast majority of people would&#39;ve been opposed to it,
but the law basically stated that we had to honor those laws if they
were passed either by Congress or by the Supreme Court through the
judicial decisions. What we have here is really the 4th circuit has
spoken, soon the Supreme Court will speak. Underneath equal protection
clause, gay couples will be sanctioned the right to marriage regardless
of how we may feel about this individually or as a matter of religious
convictions. We should not be here today at this hour trying to
circumvent the law. We should be about upholding the law. More
importantly, we should be about enforcing the US Constitution because
the US Constitution is the guiding light, it&#39;s the beacon. It is
indeed that force which gives each of us the rights that we exercise in
this chamber today but throughout our lives. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do we have any further discussion or debate? Senator Van Dyne,
for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Van Dyne, you have the floor to speak to the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. What I know about the people in my
district is that faith is at the core of their being, and I will defend
with every follicle of my being their right to practice their religion
as they choose, but this bill is not about religion, it is about
fairness. It is about equal protection under the law, and is about
working for a North Carolina that looks forward towards a future where
everyone in North Carolina has the opportunity to live their fullest
lives. Courts throughout this country have ruled that it is wrong to
legitimize discrimination, and yet that is what we are about to do
today. I represent a district that is home to thousands of same sex
couples. Families that I know personally and are on my mind today as I
speak. These are people who live every day as second class citizens and
all they want is something that you and I utterly take for granted, the
freedom to love who you love and be who you are. Denying them the right
to live their lives as their true selves is not only wrong, but it
stifles our ability to realize our potential and it is time for us to
turn this page and say once and for all that North Carolina is moving
forward, that we are open for business and we welcome unreservedly
everyone who wants to help us build a better future for ourselves and
for our children. Come visit our beaches and mountains and bring your
family and friends. Looking to expand a business? We wanna help you be
successful. We cannot be that North Carolina if at the same time we
allow anyone to feel like they&#39;re second class.

  ...and that is what this bill does: it says loud and clear that
discrimination is alive and well in NC and it has the stamp of approval
of the legislature.
That is a statement that has consequences for everyone in NC.  I
remember in 2008, I was at a conference.  There was a board member of my
local community foundation, and there was a presentation by Hugh McColl,
a former CEO of the Bank of America.  And someone asked him, I’m sure
you all remember 2008, our economies were tanking, but there was one
relatively bright spot and that was the city of Charlotte.
And the first question Mr. McColl was asked was what is different about
Charlotte?  And without hesitation, without any hesitation at all, he
said that in the 1960s, when the rest of the south was in turmoil of
segregation, that Charlotte
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Sen. Rucho, the purpose of your ayes?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Inquiry to the chair, is this relevant to this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator, if you will, I think it is relevant, Senator, but Senator, if
you will keep it focused on the bill, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, sir.  What he said without hesitation was that in 1960, when the
rest of the south was in turmoil over integration, the city of Charlotte
made the decision to embrace it.  They embraced diversity and that made
it possible for the banking industry to come to Charlotte.  What we do
today, might point is that what we do today has consequences.
We cannot be the NC of opportunity, but at the same time we allow anyone
to feel second class, so it is my hope that reason and justice will
prevail and that we will move forward together to address the issues we
were sent here to address -- jobs, education, providing opportunity for
North Carolina.  And that’s why I urge you to vote no on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Newton, for what purpose your ayes?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak to the bill for the first time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Newton, you have floor, speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Well, in the words of one of my favorite and
one of the greatest presidents, there you go again.  Sen. Van Duyn, I
want to compliment you, in a very short period of time you have become a
very accomplished debater.  You’ve stepped right into the shoes of Sen.
Nesbitt and before you Sen. Stein, and you’re very disciplined about
your talking points, and very disciplined about what they always did,
which was to take whatever legislation we were debating and read into it
all kinds of things that aren’t there...and follow your talking points
so that the newsroom observer and other media will keep printing what
you want, which is to make the bill something that it’s not.
You were in committee yesterday and you heard my explanation, and you
questioned me quite a bit.  And I appreciate those comments because I
think a debate is very helpful.  I think it’s important that we have an
opportunity to educate the public about what this bill is actually about
and not what you say it’s about, but what it’s actually about.
You talk about upholding the constitution, the constitution of NC I
presume you also mean; you talk about the US Constitution, oh yeah, I
forgot, that includes the First Amendment, the free exercise of
religion.
That’s what this bill is about.  I’ve heard all kinds of nonsense about
can you decide not to do interracial marriages.  That’s a great talking
point.  Sen. McKissick, you probably weren’t aware, but I’ve actually
litigated a number of Title VII cases dealing with race discrimination,
representing African Americans.  I won them all too.
I know a little something about Title VII.  You and I had a discussion
yesterday about the constitutionality of this bill, Senate Bill 2.  You
agreed with me it was constitutional, didn’t you?  I mean you can speak
to...

  <p id="115:00">
  and later if you disagree, but that&#39;s what I recall of the
conversation, and I think that&#39;s good legal authority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, when we get done with this, for
fairness to Senator McKissick, who&#39;s already spoken twice on the
bill, if you&#39;ll ask him that question, so he can
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I certainly will, so that he can
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You answer incorrectly
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I can maintain my speaking the bill if, to clear it
up, I&#39;ll ask him that question now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, do you yield, if you don&#39;t
mind?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you recall that that was the conversation we had
yesterday, and you agreed that this was a constitutional bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think what I indicated in my remarks to you, and
perhaps even to others: that was a very cleverly designed bill that
would essentially lawfully allow discrimination. But it potentially was
??saying?? judicial scrutiny. I do believe there is some over-breadth
issues. When I say over-breadth, it would cover not only those
situations involving those who might have religious convictions relating
to gay marriage, but also those who might be opposed to interracial
marriages and things of that sort. So the potential for over-breadth was
there, but I do believe that it was very cleverly designed and I did
acknowledge that. Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. May I presume
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can continue, Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator McKissick for that. That was, with
all due respect, that was a little different than I recalled it, but I
didn&#39;t remember hearing words about discrimination in there when we
were talking about it, but I certainly heard it today. And so I&#39;d
like to address that a little bit further. The bill, if you read it, is
just as plain as day that these magistrates don&#39;t get to treat
anybody differently. It actually makes sure that the wink-and-nod game
that might otherwise go on in a magistrate&#39;s office, can&#39;t
occur. Ultimately, if a homosexual couple wants to be married in a civil
ceremony, they&#39;re gonna get a marriage. They&#39;re not gonna get
denied under this bill. There probably are some people who would like to
say this is an aberrant activity. There are some that would like to say
that this is a violation of good moral perspective, and they would like
to deny it. But this bill actually prevents that from happening.
There&#39;s a real big difference between homosexuals seeking to get
married in a civil ceremony and interracial couples. Number one, we have
a Supreme Court case, Loving, that I believe was decided in 1976, and it
was decided on, if I remember correctly, the Civil Rights Act. And,
Senator Smith-Ingram, I know you&#39;re familiar with the Civil Rights
Act in 1964, and, but what I would like to remind you is, is that there
is nothing in that Civil Rights Act that says sexual orientation is a
protected class. Race is. Religion is. But not sexual orientation. Until
the good judges tell us that we have to read something into the law
that&#39;s not there, or until Congress passes an amendment to the Civil
Rights Act instructing us that sexual orientation is a protected class,
there&#39;s a big difference there. And I actually am quite disgusted
based upon the clients that I&#39;ve had in the past that do suffer real
discrimination based upon their race, that you would want to lump the
two together. You&#39;re born in your race. I don&#39;t know about
sexual orientation. What I heard yesterday in committee and on this
point is that folks would like to inquire into the sincerity of someone
who wants to recuse them self. Surely, surely, surely the back row is
not suggesting that these magistrates should be put on the witness stand
and cross-examined as to what their sincere religious beliefs are.
Surely that is not what the left would stand for.

Mr. President I prefer to finish my remarks and then I will be happy to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I maybe finish. Surely, that is not what the left intends to do is
to cross examine and put I think jokingly but quite seriously suggested
you don’t mean to water boat these people and get what they really think
and what they really believe. Folks we are gonna have a very serious
task before that begins here, I didn’t choose and I don’t think most of
the members of this body or most of the members of society choose to
have this debate because the vast majority of us thought that the
definition of marriage was pretty clear we thought that it was pretty
clear and above, we thought that 3,000 years of society made it pretty
clear, we thought that 300 years of these colonies in this country made
it clear, most of us thought that our founding fathers could have never
conceived something like this but yet as I said before we got some wise
old judges that no better than us, they are no better than our founding
fathers, they are no more than God, Senator Smith-Ingram my word did say
that you are referring to also told that women who go forth and send no
more. It’s not my place to judge whether or not these folks are right
with their maker that’s not up to me that’s up to him, I don’t judge
that, my job here and our job here is to decide how we are going to
handle these issues? How are we going to balance? What we know to be our
first amendment rights? What we know is right either in our personal
loves or citizens of this great republic? The rights that were endowed
by our creator which include our religious freedom, how are we going to
balance that? Those that oppose this bill and their answer is they saw
the Magistrate and the registered deeds that don’t want to participate
___??[03:19] comply, comply or prosecute you because that’s what IOC
said comply or we will prosecute you, is that right, is that what this
body would stand for? I challenge everybody on the back row and those
who want to vote against this bill to think about that, where is it go
next, where is it go next, who is next to be told and stand forward and
kiss the rain? Who is next? The Backer, the florist, we have already
seen that, we have to find a path forward; we must find a way forward. I
will not stand oddly by and watch the demands of a few, insist that a
particular Magistrate must perform a weeding that he or she strongly
believes that, I will not standby enforce that to happen. You on the
back row…

  apparently seem to think that that is what&#39;s supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, did you want to ask a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Netwon, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton I wanna make sure I understand this, correctly in terms
of how the bill works. My understanding is, that, Senator Foushee and I
could show up, to get married, and that a magistrate could refuse to
serve us giving first notice of his requests or need for a recusal at
that time to whoever the higher up would be. And that that could happen
- and receive the protection of this bill, am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, as we&#39;ve discussed before, the magistrate who is
faced with this for the first time may or may not have realized before
that moment, that that is something that they&#39;re not gonna be able
to do. They may have gone to church on Sunday, and heard Senator Tarte
over there, explain how marriage is between one man and one woman. And,
may have decided, upon laying sleeplessly at night in their bed, Sunday
night, that that wasn&#39;t something that they could deal with. And
then, then they were shocked! When, low and behold, they&#39;d never
come in the door before, and now they&#39;re faced with it. And they
feel that hand, on their shoulder, saying no, that&#39;s not right, and
you shouldn&#39;t do it. So, yes, they certainly at that moment, under
this bill, are allowed to say - You know what? I&#39;m just gonna get
out of doing marriages all together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, I thank you for saying that. So it is, true, that it is possible,
that citizens, presenting for marriage can be refused service at the
time they present, based on the provisions of this bill and that worker
would be protected. That is possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister president. Actually no, I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know
that that is the case at all. I&#39;m not aware of any counties, that
just have walk-up service like a McDonald&#39;s counter to, just perform
marriages. I have a friend, who I talked to after the committee
yesterday, who had a civil ceremony. And I asked him, I said, when you
went to the magistrate to get married, did you just show up, or did you
call, and ask, when do they do marriages? And he said, oh, I called to
find out, and most of the counties around the state don&#39;t do that,
now some I guess do, but it&#39;s.. I&#39;m sure it varies, it varies in
every county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President, one more follow-up..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thought we were on the same page.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apparently not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When you answered my first question, now you&#39;re duckin and dodgin
me. My point was, and I wanted your agreement that, under this bill, a
magistrate could decide to recuse him or herself, at the same time as a
member of the public was presenting for service, so it is possible that
that discrimination could happen at that time if the magistrate
doesn&#39;t decide to recuse until the person presents. I&#39;m not
talking about whether they call or not, or, or how often you can get
married, but it is likely, or it is possible, that that could happen
under this bill. The bill does not prohibit that. So, I&#39;m
challenging your statement that this does not discriminate against
anybody or limit their service. It could limit their service in that
particular situation, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister President. Senator Bryant, I&#39;m not a witness under
oath that you can cross-examine, and, in order to make your point,
I&#39;m very familiar with that tactic, employing it regularly in the
courtroom. The answer to your question is is that no, a couple that
presents themselves can&#39;t be discriminated against. As you read the
bill, in the plain language, ultimately, the chief district court judge,
if nobody else can perform the marriage, has to perform the marriage.
There is no discrimination involved in this process at all. What
you&#39;re trying to suggest is, that somehow our magistrates offices
are required to provide 24-7, walk-up service, you get married like
I&#39;m ordering a big mac. And that&#39;s not how it works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President, can I speak a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, you have the floor to speak a second time to the bill.

  <p id="130:00">
  You’re being disingenuous because in your first answer you acknowledge
that a citizen can be refused service under this bill at the time they
present themselves.  And that leaves us open to accusations of it being
discriminatory as it is applied.  And that is the big loophole in this
scheme that you’ve come up with, that you refuse to acknowledge, even
though you acknowledged it fully in your first answer.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Smith, the purpose of your aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. President, to speak to the bill for a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator, you have the floor to speak to the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
As I’m analyzing the comments that were shared, and I’ll have to say
last week someone was offended, I won’t call any names, but today, I am
offended.  I think that it was distasteful, some of the comments that
were made by you, Senator Newton.  Let us be reminded of what this bill
is really about; it’s not an argument about a protected class.  This is
not a protected class argument.  I’m not an attorney, but even I know
that.  And the savior that I serve, before he told the young woman to go
and sin no more, he said he who is without sin cast the first stone.
We must stop playing like we are God and we have all of the right
answers.  Looking at the totality of the scripture, look at the totality
of this bill.  No one has done the--maybe you added, maybe you
subtracted, maybe you multiplied and divided.  You can’t do the
calculus, but no one has done the accounting.  How much is this gonna
cost taxpayers?  How much scheduling conflict is this going to create
for the judges who must now perform marriages for everyone for a six
month period of a time following the recusal of all of the magistrates?
And what I’m simply sharing is that don’t stop at the preamble of the
constitution of NC.
Go even further to Article 1, Section 5, which states that we will not
pass a law that subverts the federal government.  This is a you threw
the ball at me, you panel of judges on the Fourth Circuit Court, so let
me throw the ball back at you.  This is not a game.  This is people’s
lives and this involves the fundamental rights that people have that we
are depriving them of.  And we’re not doing it in a way that is even
accommodating or efficient.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Speak on the bill.  I don’t think anything anybody says from--actually,
I don’t think anything anybody said from 10 o’clock until now has
changed anybody’s mind.  And I don’t think anything that I’m going to
say is going to change anybody’s mind.  And so I don’t, I don’t know
that I can offer anything new, but just a couple of observations: First,
anyone in NC who is entitled to be married, pursuant to NC law, to NC
court decision or decision will be able to get married in NC if this
bill passes.
So all of the discussion about discrimination and not allowing people to
get married, that’s not this bill.  One of the interesting things that
I’ve learned, when I first came here, I practiced law for a number of
years and I was, I was accustomed to if I asked the question and the
question really didn’t have anything to do with what the case was about,
the judge would call me down on that.  That isn’t happening here.
It’s a little more free wheeling and it needs to be a little more free
wheeling, but the reality is that this bill does not prevent anybody
from getting married, and saying that it does doesn’t change that fact.
The other thing is there’s been a lot of discussion about how this is
not the main thing we ought to be working on.  And I know there’s a lot
of talk about that, but if we’re not about holding up the rights
guaranteed by our constitution in this body, then all the other stuff

  Eventually it&#39;s not worth very much. We are all a nation of laws. I
think that&#39;s one of the things that distinguishes us from those
other nations in the world for the most part and those other nations and
societies that came before us. So yes, we have to respect the law, and
this bill does that. We are also a nation of people that started in many
respects with folks that came here in order to be able to freely
exercise their religious beliefs. Those principles are shrived in our
founding documents, and i wasn&#39;t there and none of us were, but I
heard the argument of the first amendment is first amendment. I
don&#39;t know if one outweighs the other, but that is the point of this
bill. we are not saying that the first amendment outweighs any other
right that might exist. What we are saying is that there should be an
accommodation when there is a conflict between rights. And when there is
that conflict. One of the reasons why we have legislative bodies and one
of the reasons that we exist is that our job is to tell people where the
lines are. We are about drawing the lines, and sometime drawing the line
is a very difficult thing to do, because there are arguments on both
sides, and the law is pretty clear that we have an obligation as if we
are going to be a nation of laws to provide a reasonable accommodation
when there is the kind of conflict that we see here. That&#39;s all this
bill is trying to do. It&#39;s all for that reasonable accommodation.
Could the line be drawn differently?  Yes. Could be put somewhere else?
Obviously. The concern that many have about whether or not someone could
get married or not get married, again that is not this bill. The concern
that many have that religious belief should be protected should honored,
should recognized, isn&#39;t this bill, and isn&#39;t an important part
of this bill. So this is something that I think recognizes the current
reality of the current legal situation recognizes the existence of
rights that people have understood that exists in this country for a
very long period of time and tries to draw a balance, tries to draw the
balance that will enable people to live their lives as they would like
to but would not have the government forcing them to do something
that&#39;s against their core beliefs. I urge you to vote for the
bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion Aye. Hearing none.

Announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One second, Senator. Let me make sure we
got everything else done on here and we’ll get on there. We are under
notices and announcements. Go ahead, Senator Rucho. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Just to remind everybody
that the Senate Finance Committee meeting will be held at 1 o’clock
today. There will be a lot of discussion during this session dealing
with economic development tools. This will be very important for
everyone to attend and we will extend it open to members that aren’t in
the Finance Committee to join us to try and get some good background on
this before we make some decisions about it. So that’s in 544 today at 1
o’clock. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Brock, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, you have the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Agriculture will meet. We may be in 643 since Senator
Rucho has precedent over 544. We’ll hear from the new Secretary of DENR
and some issues relating to regulatory environment and the changes we
made over the last couple of sessions. Hope you can join. It will be 10
minutes after session. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark, you have the
floor for a point of personal privilege, explanation of vote. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] With regard to Senate Bill 2, I voted in support of Senate Bill
2 because I believe that it protects the religious liberties of our
citizens without discriminating against the rights of any of our
citizens to engage in the civil marriage ceremonies. I understand that
there are strong feelings on both sides of this issue, and I’ve listened
very carefully to the passionate arguments put forth by colleagues on
both sides of the aisle and the many constituents who have called,
emailed or spoken to me in person to register their respective
positions. As I believe that all in these chambers are, I am deeply
committed to equal rights and fair treatment for all North Carolinians.
After thoughtful consideration, I am persuaded that Senate Bill 2
accomplished two important tasks with regards to the poor performance of
some

  Ceremonies in the state of North Carolina. Senate Bill 2 ensures the
rights of all couples to be married while protecting the religious
freedoms of individuals with sincerely held beliefs. Absolutely no one
will be prevented from being married in a civil ceremony by the passage
of Senate Bill 2 nor will their efforts to be married in such a ceremony
be abridged by Senate Bill 2. Most citizens if not all in the state as a
result of Senate Bill 2 will find that their ability to seek civil
ceremonies has actually increased by the bill&#39;s mandate that all
counties set aside at least 10 hours a week for any couple to be duly
married by a magistrate judge. Some counties don&#39;t provide that
protection as we speak today. Senate Bill 2 ensures that the religious
liberties of those with deeply held convictions on the issue of marriage
would be protected, that the path is reasonable and non-discriminatory
measures, and that no one seeking civil ceremonies will be treated any
different from anyone else seeking such a ceremony. We, the highest
legislative body in the state have not only the authority to modify the
job responsibilities of the given position when prudent, we have an
obligation to protect our religious liberties in ways that do not
prevent our citizens from receiving the services to which they are
entitled. Senate Bill 2 does an artful job of this by placing the
responsibility of this particular service with the office not a specific
individual and then ensuring that any citizen will be provided that
service during more hours than provided under current law. I&#39;m
satisfied that Senate Bill 2 is a fair and reasonable compromise to an
important issue facing our state and therefore I have registered a yes
vote without reservation. My parents experienced much discrimination
over the course of their life, even during my lifetime. I as well have
experienced much discrimination over the course of my life. I know
discrimination when I see it. This is not discrimination. If I thought
it was, I most certainly would not have voted in support of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Any further notices or
announcements. Senator Rydell for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I rise for the purpose of a personal privilege. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Ladies and
gentlemen of the Senate, I rise today to honor a North Carolina native
son and Charlottier, Charlie Siefert, who passed away on February the
3rd as the first black person to play on the Professional Golf
Association. Mr. Siefert was a trailblazer. He is credited with
inspiring generations of black golfers, specifically Tiger Woods who
often referred to him as the grandfather he never had. Charlie Siefert
was a man of humble beginnings who began caddying on golf courses in
Charlotte at the age of 13. He began playing professionally at age 27 in
1949 and after decades of playing segregated tournaments around the
country, became a member of the PGA in 1961. While Mr. Siefert&#39;s
dedication, courage and position as a first earned him many accolades,
he maintained that all he ever wanted to do was to play golf. Despite
harassments and abuse, Mr. Siefert remained steadfast and enjoyed a long
career in the sport. His career and legacy served to prove that if you
work hard and persevere, your gifts will make room for you. He is a
credit to North Carolina and Charlotte and it is a great pleasure to
honor him today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Any other notices
or announcements? Senator Curtis, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] An announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Curtis you have the
floor for an announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The workforce committee
scheduled for 12 o&#39;clock today is canceled and rescheduled for next
Wednesday at 12 o&#39;clock. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further business to
come before the Senate? If not, the chair recognizes Senator Berger for
a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, if I could make an
announcement before the motion. Members of the Senate, I don&#39;t know
that we can place a whole lot of confidence in the weatherpersons that
are telling us what&#39;s going to happen, but it appears that they seem
to be of like mind across the spectrum

  That we&#39;re going to get some bad weather in. So I know there are a
number of folks who no disrespect to the city of Raleigh would prefer
not to spend the weekend in Raleigh. And so what we&#39;re going to do
is the motion I&#39;m going to make is that we adjourn to Friday at two
p.m. that will be a skeletal session. And then we will at that skeletal
session have an adjournment to Monday at seven. We will have at least
one bill on the calendar at that time the bill will be on for third
reading that we pass second reading today. So, this will allow everyone
hopefully to get home safely and hope you enjoy your weekend. Mr.
President I move that the Senate do now adjourn subject to standard
stipulation set forth in Senate rule 24.1 and receipt of committee
reports to reconvene on Friday February 27 2015 at two pm.
[Speaker Changes]
The motion is the Senate do now adjourn subject to the standard
stipulations to reconvene Friday February 27 at two pm seconded by
Senator Newton. All in favor say aye. Oppose no. The aye&#39;s have it,
Senate stands adjourned.
