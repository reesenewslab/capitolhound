  The Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery,
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in
the gallery, please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let&#39;s pray. Thank you,
Heavenly Father, for this day. We acknowledge that you do govern these
affairs. That even if a sparrow can&#39;t fall to the ground without you
noticing, how can we think that you&#39;re indifferent to what we do
here. Make plain to us your plans, for you know how bad we can be and
how stubborn in our own intentions we are. We pray for your help today
and we pray that you put your love in our hearts. Through Jesus Christ,
our Lord we pray. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin is recognized
for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, the journal of Thursday,
February 19, 2015 has been examined and is found to be correct. I move
that the Senate dispense with the reading of the journal and that it
stand approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection the
journal for February 19th stands approved as written. Senators, we do
have a nurse of the day with us today, Atina Showen from Waxon, North
Carolina. Nurse Showen, thank you for being with us today. We appreciate
your support. [Applause] Are there any notices or announcements? Is
there any further business to come before the Senate. If not, the chair
recognizes Senator Apodaca for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. President. I&#39;d like the record to show that Senator
Jackson&#39;s here again on Monday but not by himself. Mr. President, I
move that the Senate do now adjourn subject to the standard stipulation
set forth in Senate rule 24.1 to reconvene on Tuesday, February 24th at
2:00 PM. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is the Senate do now adjourn
subject to the standard stipulations to reconvene Tuesday, February 24th
at 2:00PM, seconded by Senator Harrington. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The ayes have it.
The Senate stands adjourned.
