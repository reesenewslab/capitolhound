  The House Committee on Elections will come to order. Members, please
take your seats. Visitors, please take your seats in the rear of the
chamber.
Members, the purpose of today&#39;s meeting is to hear and take action
on Senate Bill 181. The schedule will be as following. The Chair intends
to recognize the senator from Wake County for about a two minute
presentation. The chair will then recognize Representative  Stam from
Wake County for up to five minutes presentation. We will then cause the
committee discussion as we have numerous citizens who have requested to
speak on this bill and we will take public comment at that time. When
those who have signed up to speak have been given the opportunity to do
so, we will at that point resume the committee discussion.
With that, the matter before the Elections Committee is Senate Bill 181.
Sen.  Barefoot, you are recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part of me, Senator.  Do members have copies of the bill? You have the
floor Sen. Barefoot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you members of the House.
The purpose of this bill is to increase representation and geographic
diversity on the  Wake County Board of Commissioners and to ensure that
every Wake County voter has a voice. Wake County is one of the
state&#39;s most populous counties and is part of one of the fastest
growing metropolis areas in the country. Currently the commission is
made up of seven members, five of which live within the city of Raleigh.
 Seventy-five percent of the towns in Wake County don&#39;t have a
single representative on the county commission. So what is this bill do?
This bill increases representation on the Wake County Board of
Commissioners from seven members to nine. One of the new member
districts will represent the city at large. One of the new member
districts will represent the small towns at large. This bill changes the
current at-large election process to a single-member district election
process to ensure geographical diversity within Wake County.
The bill also aligns the Wake County Commission districts to the Wake
County School Board districts&#39;s,  which has been upheld by the
courts and already been upheld by the Courts and already approved by
this body.
This will provide for increased accountability and transparency between
our elected officials. The current archaic system was developed before I
was even born, when Wake County&#39;s population was only roughly
300,000 people. It requires candidates to run costly, county-wide
campaigns limiting the pool of those who are financially able to run. It
forces our County commissioners to serve almost 1,000,000 constituents
each, more constituents then members of Congress.
The most recent election proves that current system ignores our small
towns and most importantly, the will of the people. It does this by
denying communities the power to choose their local elected officials.
For example, the commissioner who represents Fuquay-Varina represents a
district that voted to elect his opponent in the 2014 election. Boosted
by heavy voter turnout inside the Raleigh city limits, Mr. Calabria won
his countywide election by a wide margin, but he lost his own district
by nearly five points, or 2,400 votes.
So lost the people at Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina and Garner.
This bill ensures that this will no longer occur.
Under my bill, if a County Commissioner candidate receives the most
votes in their district in which they run then they will represent that
district, just like you and I. In fact opponents of this plan have
argued essentially by implication that we should elect the Legislature
statewide. We tried that with Superior Court judges and it was struck
down.
I also represent another county, Franklin County with Miss Richardson.
Franklin County&#39;s population is roughly 60,000 people. They have
seven County commissioners, five in residential districts and two
at-large, much like we are proposing here. Wake County has 1 million
people and only seven members. Our county commissioners prone to
represent more people than the governor of Delaware. Meanwhile, the
citizens get lost in the numbers.
The current election process needs to be improved and we can fix it.
Representation is strongest when it is closest to the people. We feel
the most disconnect between president

As U.S. senators and governors want to relate to them or the county
commissioners local office but there&#39;s nothing local about running
to represent one million people
and Mr. Vs.Tammy recognizes when the bill make of it, it was explained
very well the server barefoot out just the right public comments tonight
is a big one for a
few questions later at large districts against it for 35 years finally
we realize what has been in litigation all over the country at large

complained of a rebel is that maxim sales but we&#39;re not using maps,
blue we&#39;re using the
exact same doubts that if approved by the Federal District court a year
ago for our school board as one appeal the fourth circuit I don&#39;t
believe the opponents will
we and if they do it would have the same effect on this but the closing
or even approve a Federal District court there&#39;s no need to calm
innovate and try to improve
on massive bill as you listen to a video of people, some of the people
of why county does relies that simple it also no one is terms will be
shortened the people who
will come up for reelection in 2016 can run in their same district say
been writing and all from the previous four years if they want to know
terms are short and
they can run at large from the residence district bill will only be
completely phased in and 2018 to be effective beginning and 401912 units

presses the committee on elections were going to extend to all who

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The very recent county commissioner race makes
partisan reasons a much more likely motivator for this bill, as we all
know, and as your constituents will clearly understand. In two recent
polls, Wake County voters have said they do not support this bill as is,
and without a bipartisan commission having time to assess its need
and/or a voter referendum, this bill clearly does not meet the test of
being fair or deliberate if passed. The will of the voter will once
again, if this is passed, have been denied. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma&#39;am. Speaker number two if you would
state your name please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello my name is Irv Portman, I&#39;m a 24 year
resident of Wake County. I&#39;m the owner of a manufacturing business
and employer here in Wake County, and I also have served in elected
office on the Cary Town Council and as a member of the Wake County Board
of Commissioners. Each of you made an important decision to stand for
office, to serve the public, and you did it for an important reason. You
did it, you said you would run to make things better. You said you would
run to stop fixing and rigging of elections. You said you would stand up
to doing things wrong and stand up to big government telling local
government what to do. Some of you have done more.  Representative Stam,
I don&#39;t agree with some of what you do, but there&#39;s
some-something you&#39;ve done I applaud. For 20 years you&#39;ve been a
clarion voice against a rigging of elections. You&#39;ve called for
election reform. A majority of the House members, 62, have co-signed a
bill which would call for an impartial redistricting commission to end
the rigging of elections. This bill today makes about as much sense as
an alcoholic saying I&#39;m going to stop drinking after the next beer.
Let me rig the county commission and then I&#39;ll stand up to
gerrymandering forever. This bill is an abuse of power, rigging of
elections is wrong, and big government telling local government what to
do is wrong as well and you know it. We can see the effect of rigged
elections in Washington. Please, don&#39;t bring that dysfunctional
state to our local offices. Some say to the victor go the spoils, get
over it. It&#39;s a great sports analogy. But this isn&#39;t sports,
this is our democracy, and just because you can do something does not
mean you should. With this vote you will have a chance to leave a
legacy. Make sure the legacy you leave is something you will be proud to
tell your grandkids about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker number three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, my name is John
??. I live in the county between Fuquay -Varina and Holly Springs. I
urge you, and will make an argument why you should support and vote for
Senate Bill 181. A lot of people have made this into a political debate.
I&#39;d like to argue that it&#39;s not a political debate, it&#39;s a
foundational debate. 239 years ago this country, through the Declaration
of Independence, stood up for voting with representation. Our colonies,
our people, the people that we are today, didn&#39;t have a voice in
parliament in England that represented them. They didn&#39;t get to
choose it. So England came up with a very convenient way to justify
that. They called that virtual representation, which the colonies
denied. So let&#39;s take that into modern times. Do we have virtual
representation? When an elected official cannot, does not win the vote
in the area that they actually represent, but is voted into office by
people outside of that district, outside of that area that they
represent, we&#39;ve got a modern day form of virtual represntation.
It&#39;s not the will of the people that they represent. In my case, in
my district, my representative did not win my district, yet another
authority, maybe similar to a foreign body that could mandate who
represents or how, how voting is taking place or anything else that you
want to make that into like

chance of making more of our legislative districts competitive again I

politically motivated and its passage is going to embitter more citizens

so please
I encourage you like to urge you please vote against senate bill 181

its worst Westmont five appear before you, forcing some as this bill was
run through the
house and less than a week (SPEAKER CHANGES) I thank you Mr. Chairman
for taking more time on the side of the buildings greatly appreciated
why did not agree with the process by
which this bill was addresses seven nevertheless way county heard the
criticism of our system and we take very seriously as why we&#39;ve
started the citizens commission
countywide representation are easily economically racially and
politically diverse group that will thoroughly examine whether changes
needed, so why change makes
sense for recount the change if it comes will come from the bottom of
the way things are supposed to be the reverse this body to give that
process find work tree
senator barefoot spill as a needed domino that got the processing or the
process started but do not adopt the district&#39;s if you see the 41
because frankly every
justification offered by supporters of these districts is false is said
that the current system is too expensive and serves as a barrier for
elections and I spent
$235,000 one 10th as much as the senator and receive five times as many
votes as he did it all in all three of my colleagues for first time
elected officials none
of us has ever served in elected office to four is not a barrier to
entry is a very doable collection is said that municipalities will be
better represented with
local representation it with a map of the districts under this bill
conveniently the one before you does not have the city boundaries drawn
with the one that has
the city boundaries and you&#39;ll see that area sliced into four
districts wander into five wake forest and roll celery sliced into two

asking forced to delay this
bill use it as a chance for a community to come together and propose
something that the entire community to support to get behind and yes

…Elected me and my colleagues were running under the system and under
the lines that republicans drew. We won that race just like many of you
won races in districts that democrats drew that’s the way democracy
works, if we need to redraw this system let the people of Wake County do
it, we will be happy to do it and we will do it in a fair and equitable
manner muck like Mr. Stam has repeatedly requested that the whole people
of North Carolina do for all the districts in North Carolina. I promise
you, you will be proud of the effort that Wake County puts forward in
this regard and I thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Commissioner, speaker #8 was Commissioner Steve Rawat, the
Chair was advised the commissioner…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He asked me to inform you that he had to go for a family engagement for
he was going to speak against the bill, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Commissioner, I just wanted to make sure we didn’t skip and
speaker #9.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is ?? Lambert and I’m a 17 years resident of Wake County, a
small business owner and a recent citizen as you can probably tell from
my accent. Thank you for taking my comments, I would like to put one
side the rights and wrongs of the districts how that drawn and whether
this is a good or bad partisan move. My comments relate to process or
perhaps process with no pressing elections to necessitate this bill
being rushed through at no senses to indicate a need for redistricting,
why not go through a consultative process, the citizens and voters of
Wake County deserve to participate in a discussion of the rights and
wrongs of this bill. Let us hear the data to support arguments and favor
of the bill, let us understand the reasons for drawing lines as you
have, give us credit for being interested and motivated by the privilege
of voting for our elected officials, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, speaker #10.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Harvey Schmitt and I live at 9005, Armitage Court in Wake
County, I have come  to you as both as citizen of 22 years of Wake
County and as President and CEO of the Greater Raleigh Chamber of
Commerce. I want to begin my remarks but recognizing the merits of the
bill as they have been presented in a county with over a million people,
there should be more representation on our board of commission.
Additionally, there are benefits of having a combination of district and
at large representation and we appreciate those suggested changes.
However, reviewing the bill we have considered many factors including
the local quality of life, growth, and prosperity, and economic
development, and keeping those factors in mind we have a couple of
concerns about this legislation. My first is the elimination of truly at
large districts; truly at large districts allow Representatives to look
at our county as a whole. The majority of North Carolina counties and
municipalities have at least some at large representation because it’s a
system that works and without a county wide prospective we will have a
system of district versus district in the our location of scare
resources. All commissioners will be focused on bringing home ?? to
their own district and that creates an environment of competition
instead of collaboration at some point the interest of the whole county
need to be represented at the table. Additionally, we are concerned that
there has been very little community dialogue on the issue, the citizens
of Wake County should have the ability to way in and how they are
represented. And I urge you to consider allowing this issue to go to
either a referendum or taking the time to receive recommendations from
the counties, newly created citizen’s committee on county redistricting.
So I come to you today as a Chamber Executive, Business Representative,
and as a citizen and I ask you to consider, reconsider moving this
forward, this legislation forward, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, members for the record just to be clear that was actually
speaker #11, Mr. Schmitt, is this speaker #10 or is this speaker #12?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
#10 left, so we now move to speaker #12. You have the floor madam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m Lynn Admen’s, is that speaker #12? My name is Lynn Admen’s and I’m
the parent of two students in Wake County public schools, I strongly
oppose Senate Bill 181. Sponsors and supporters of this bill are not
listening to the citizens of Wake County as evidence to what the results
of a pole released last week. This bill inserts partisanship into our
school…

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] All in Jackson. In closing, I would like to say that
the plan does not solve the problem it is supposed to solve. It is
people from northern Wake County, it&#39;s people from northern Wake
County are not most likely going to be represented by someone in Raleigh
or southern Wake County because of how the districts are drawn. The map
is clearly designed to give Republicans an advantage and not, and that
is not fair. Wake County has thrown strong, a strong history of
supporting, has shown a strong history of supporting candidates across
racial lines, similarly African Americans who have been elected
countywide. I&#39;ll stop, okay. Most recently Commissioner West and
Holmes, I want to throw that in. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Dr. Johnson. Speaker number 18. Welcome sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m Dustin Ingalls, speaker number 18. I grew up
in northeastern Wake County and I now live in Knightdale, just one
precinct over from the bill sponsor&#39;s district. One of the points
raised in support of SB 181 is that four of the seven Wake County
Commissioners live in Raleigh, suggesting they are unable to represent
the interests of other parts of the county. But does Senator Barefoot
not provide the representation the law requires for Franklin County,
despite the fact he lives in Wake County, some 38 miles southwest of the
northeasternmost corner of the Franklin County parts of his district? I
think he does. Senator Barefoot and others have said this bill provides
more local control, when in fact it does the opposite. it would not
allow Wake County voters or their commissioners, to have any say on
these district lines until four more county commission elections have
passed in the year 2022. And even then there is no specific guarantee in
the law of a referendum. In the meantime, 154 legislators who represent
no parts of Wake County, including all but two members of this
committee, will have had a say on how Wake County voters elect our own
county commissioners. But we won&#39;t, for at least another seven
years. That makes no sense and that is the opposite of local governance.
According to a poll released last week that some others have referred
to, the people agreed. Only 26% of Wake County voters support this bill.
Representative Stam, only 30% of your voters support it. The Senate is
messing with local affairs at every turn, but you&#39;ve already shown
the capacity to disagree with them. And here&#39;s another chance to
listen to the people and let them continue to govern themselves. I urge
you to take it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Member, speaker number 19 is former Representative
Russell Capps. We&#39;re glad to have you back sir, welcome to the
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity
to speak before you. I served 12 years in this body and one of the
committees that I served on each of the 12 years was the local
government committee. I especially requested that because I think that
local bills are closer to the people than anything else you consider.
And I come to you today asking you to approve this bill. It&#39;s a
simple bill, it&#39;s been explained well. It&#39;s a fairness bill. I
was impressed, as we all were, with the Sergeant-At-Arms talking about
fairness. He was very fair in everything he explained. He laid the rules
down and said it&#39;s all about fairness. I can tell you this bill is
about fairness. It gives the opportunity for voters througout the county
to be represented as they should, instead of the vast majority of voters
within the city government controlling everything. I urge you, ladies
and gentlemen, I know the feeling of the people because I&#39;ve served
for 21 years as head of the Wake County Taxpayers&#39; Association and
we we have connection with many, many voters in Wake County. And I have
not heard a single poll of the kind these people are talking about. I
urge you to approve this bill. It&#39;s a good bill, a fair bill for
Wake County. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker number 20. Welcome sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Ed
Jones, and I am Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Wake County
Taxpayers&#39; Association. We support this bill, and I support this
bill, but I&#39;d like to make it clear to you that I haven&#39;t come
lately to this idea of supporting the vote of the people by district. I
have felt for 35, 40 years that it was a dumb way to collect-to elect
people from Wake County to represent us on the Commission by having it
countywide. I&#39;ve always felt that we needed districts. A lady
mentioned to me earlier this afternoon as we came in that she thought
she remembered that we used to vote by district in Wake County. Perhaps
that was back in the 60s or 70s or early 80s, and I seem to recall that
we did have district voting also as well. As of today, you&#39;ve heard
before, several people have mentioned this

remember 22 is Commissioner Pauline green way county circuit, and some 5
minutes as well for me to serving Mr. Perot me and my name is Mike Lowry
and we county
commissioner from the point arena my guess is by now you&#39;re well
acquainted with the organs for instance, be it a proponents of this bill
will continue to say that
it promotes diversity and 80 cultural areas the opponents of this bill
will say creates instability and destroys moderation or, but you also
know it was really
driving this bill is none of those things its power is the power to
control electoral outcomes regardless of what people have sent out we
just, (SPEAKER CHANGES) like a couple months
there was no gerrymandering involved because our elections were county
one and no thinking person&#39;s room can imagine this bill coming
forward last year when the
composition of the county commission was different from what it is now
we also know it&#39;s about power because it&#39;s not just happy we
county is happening and county
governments and municipal governments and school board governments
throughout the state right now this is part of larger trend of
fabricating division among more
people rich against four republican against democrat are older girl vs.
Irvine bowl for all the talk about North Carolina been divided into two
north carolina&#39;s
near board is one North Carolina people may have different backgrounds
people may be struggling with different things but ultimately we need to
face this as the
United Group anytime people are divided into two sore people restart
record we treating people is it there and cans it&#39;s usually because
of the politics of winners
and losers and we need to reject back, mentality and that sort of
situation no one has been made my district in particular, it stems from
a fundamental gist of
misunderstanding which I want to address the current system drawn.
Runway county district, the one running county one creek, is intended to
guarantee the course
one commissioner comes from every one of those districts is intended to
guarantee geographical diversity now whether that&#39;s a cheap we can
talk about in recent
months to disagree with 5:00 AM certainly we can talk about redrawing
the actual districts themselves but this notion that we only represent
our art district is
incorrect I have to live in a district.....

  I represent every citizen of Wake County. My phone rings whether that
call is coming from Roseville or Wake Forest of ?? Marina or Garner or
any other place in the county. So the notion that these districts are in
some way unrepresented is simply not correct. And just by the way, there
are four county commissioners of the seven, not five, who live in
Raleigh. With respect to a comment that was made earlier, if we could
follow a process that was non-partisan or bi-partisan that got broad
input from a large swath of people from throughout the county, a diverse
group of people, and we could pass that by referendum, if that meant
losing my seat you bet I would still vote for it because the underlying
premise in all of this is that government matters more than the people
who happen to be in the seats. This bill is about disliking the people
who happen to be in the seats, compared to what it was just a year ago.
We have to oppose this bill and choose, to allow our better angels to
prosper in this situation. Gerrymandering is wrong, no matter who does
it. That’s something that I think y’all know too, and that’s why I hope
you’ll vote against this bill or at least amend it to ameliorate many of
the harms that come with it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Speaker number
23, is this Commissioner West? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. West, as the Chair of the Wake County Board of Commission, we’re
pleased to welcome you to. The Sergeant at Arms will extend the
gentleman five minutes for his remarks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so
much and good evening to each of you. I am James West, chair of the Wake
County Board of Commissioners. I oppose this bill as it is. I’m very
concerned about the process that has been used. I don’t think it’s an
engaging process. I served on the Raleigh City Council as an elected six
consecutive terms and I represented a district, served on the Wake
County Board of Commissioners, and I live in a residential district and
I run at large, as we all do. So I have a perspective. I know the pros
and cons and the pluses and minuses of serving the district as well as
running at large. I think we need some combination thereof, the whole
issue related to looking at how we can better serve our constituents.
It’s very, very important but the thing that I’m very concerned about is
that we’ve kind of rushed to judgement on this. We have not really
looked at all the objective data. I think this has been a very
subjective process. Also, I’ve heard reference made several times to a
board being seven democrats versus seven republicans. This is rather
unique but I think we should look at the reasons that this happened. I
think it’s representation, listening to the people, also if you look at
over years, we have had extremely good balance on our Wake County Board
of Commissioners in terms of Republican majorities as well as Democratic
majorities, and trying to work together to achieve a common end. Local
control is one of my biggest concerns. I think the key to government is
good local control at the local level. And I feel that there’s a trend
here that is not really good, where that Wake County, it appears to me,
has been singled out in terms of the structure of how we are elected.
I’m not talking about districts. If you look across the state, I think
that’s the strength of this state and the strength of our democracy. As
has been mentioned in 1981, we established this at-large residential
district process. It was tweaked in 2012. I was a part of that, and it’s
kind of interesting that the General Assembly did not weigh in at that
particular time. So that is a little bit suspect, from my point of view.
This form of government is truly working. We have not ?? as I said, to
what we have completely but I think the right process and tweaking this
process and looking at gaps and how we can work together as a team is
very, very important. And it also has been mentioned that a referendum
to give the people the input and at least allow this citizen committee
on representation to work together, this bill from my perspective and
I’m not an extreme person but this is an extreme bill. We will swing
from 100% at-large to 100% districts, and we

  Have much broader responsibility than the school board and this analogy
to the school board to me is not a very good analogy. The at-large
positions, whether it’s as it is or whether we’re talking about some
balance between that, it gives a big-picture perspective and ?? the need
for us to look at those things that bring us together to look at the big
picture in relationship to the parts to the whole. And so I feel that we
have a strong economy. And Wake County contributes tremendously to the
gross state ?? So I think the key here is let us try to work together.
That is the bottom line, and talk to each other to see if we can work
this thing out, which would be good for the people of Wake County. And
let’s not establish a trend that would be bad long-term for us. So I
appeal to you, please don’t rush to judgement. Give this some time and
remember that strong leadership, which I expect in this particular body,
is when the leader’s willing to sacrifice his or her personal interest
for the greater good. Thank you so much. God bless you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve received an
inquiry from the committee, so the Chair would like to inform he
members, the Chair is aware of nine additional speakers on this matter.
It is the Chair’s intent to debate this bill tonight. The Chair’s aware
of six amendments that have been submitted so far, and it is the Chair’s
intent to review those and to debate this bill tonight, and to
ultimately accept and vote on the committee’s recommendation for this
bill. With that, speaker number 24 is no longer here. Speaker number 25,
welcome ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Good evening. My name is
Letice Rhodes, and I’m here to speak to the democratic process, and the
violation of its principles. This morning when I checked my email I
learned that bill 181 was scheduled for public comment with less than 20
hours notice. Additionally, Bill 181 itself is a travesty for democracy.
Redistricting in order to determine the outcome of a race, also known as
gerrymandering. Wake County voters fairly elected our sitting county
commissioners and will contest your attempts to gerrymander our
candidates and officials out of office. Facing your plan ?? does not
make it more ethical. I’m here tonight as a matter of democratic
principle, to request a minimum of 24 hours notice for hearings, to
request that the state legislature stay out of the workings of local
municipalities, and to support non-partisan redistricting. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Speaker number 26 is Mr. Bill Gilkerson, someone who
is known to many of us here as a long-time staffer. It’s good to see you
back, sir. You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I did not
realize that this was going to be a public hearing so I didn’t prepare
anything. So I decided that what I would do is act, oh, Bill GIlkerson,
I’ve been a resident of Wake County for more than 30 years and I used to
work here. I didn’t realize this was going to be a public hearing so I
didn’t prepare anything but I thought I’d ask some questions that
generally go to the question of where did the bill come from. I know
that when legislators introduce bills, they usually do it because
somebody urged them to do so. The first question is, is there a national
strategy to redistrict local boards in cities and counties that are
leaning democratic, so that republicans can control those boards. Does
it come from Alec or some national organization of that sort, similar to
the red state project that we know about, and is this bill a part of
that? Was the Greensboro bill a part of that? Next question is did
interest groups, whose economic interest groups whose activities are
regulated by the Wake County Commissioners, ask for this bill and what
did they play in it? What role did they play in it? And the third
question is, were most of the people who requested this bill

Inside Wake County or outside Wake County, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sir, Speaker #27.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the chance to speak. I’m??, I lived in Wake County most of
my life. I’m leaving a map here today, it would have been nice if there
have been more notice and last night they will be a lot more people out
here to speak. The proposed commissioner districts are traced on this
map which I will leave, and it has some municipal limits in Wake County.
This map counters Senator Barefoot’s claim that is proposed to give
better representation to the outline municipalities in Wake County. As
it’s evident only Wendell Ambulant and Morris Field are spare the
carving knife, all others are split into at least two districts of parts
of Raleigh in District 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, parts of Gardner are 1, 4, 6,
and 7, and parts of Carrie in 5, 6, and7. Representative Stam has
suggested that ordinarily he would support districts been drawn by an
independent re-districting commission but since we already have these
maps approved for the School Board districts, he supports this plan.
Stam is taking advantage of the Wake County Board of hard work to
de-patronize the work of local governance to get falls for reassurance
of this sensibility of this plan. Unfortunately, most voters do not yet
realized to have it but these jury mandate districts are going to read
in the school board raise in 2016. As they should be these maps are
still in court. The increase stability of Wake County’s local governance
comes from a more logical geographically condense map which was drawn by
the Republicans in 2010 and 2011. These districts aren’t healthy for the
school system or our county. The voter of Wake County and all of North
Carolina deserve better, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and Mr. ?? if you would like to submit something and please
feel free to give it to the Sergeant-At-Arms and make sure guest and the
clerk, and the guest including in the record. Speaker #28, welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Hi, my name is Taylor Dolthy, I’m currently a resident in ??
arena, I have a degree in business with a concentration in accounting
and a CPA designation. I have over 25 years of experience ranging from
large enterprises to venture back start ups and my husband and I
currently own and run a small business. I’m in favor of bill 181, Wake
County is one of the largest counties in North Carolina in terms of
population and it is both geographically and economically diverse. Well,
it is the home to many high-tech companies; there are still many rural
areas where residents are living in agricultural businesses, each region
of the county has its unique attribute which I believe will be more
fairly represented by the passing of this bill. This legislation
increases representation for the citizens of Wake County, how can that
be seeing as a negative. It ensures that small towns and counties have a
voice which leads to accountability between elected officials and their
constituents. Senate Bill 181 is a common sense measure to expand
representation in the local government and I sincerely appreciate your
support and moving it forward, thank you.

Speaker #29.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name Dwayne ?? thank you ladies and gentlemen for allowing me to
speak today. As I have heard some of the previous comments and some of
the threats to you all availed and un-availed as far as your electoral
chances, if you support this bill I’m reminded of why 239 years ago we
were broke out to rest control from those in power back to the people.
So I’m here to appeal for peace today and you can have peace if you will
pass this bill, I have lived in Wake County for nearly quarter of a
century, in the county I have never lived in municipality and frankly
I’m embarrassed to hear my County Commissioners speak and say they
represent me yet if they have their way they will permanently exclude me
from having to say and who my county commissioners are. As long as
Raleigh carry, hold the majority and things stay the same, I will never
have to say and who my representative is. They have said we should put
it out to…

for just a moment. [PAUSE] ?? Essentially what Mecklenberg County has
done for years. Third, Mr. ?? asked two questions. Did this come from
Alec. No, haven’t heard from Alec on this or anything similar. I don’t
know of any nationwide thing, and who thought of this bill? Who brought
it to us? There she is. She doesn’t even talk. Fran George. Her father
was a famous Wake County commissioner, JT Knot. She lives out in the
county, and she doesn’t like the fact that she doesn’t have any
representation out there. Finally, I was tricked into running for
political office for the first time in 1984. I was told that if I would
put my name on the ballot, that I could withdraw it within 30 days, they
could put a real candidate on the ballot. It was a three county
district. Wakely and Harnett, three senators representing. So I got into
it. Unfortunately the law didn’t let me withdraw and I didn’t want to
lose so I tried, and I won the primary and I had three on three and I
lost badly because Wake County totally submerged Lee Harnett. They
picked ??. But when I looked at the map, I realized after I had lost
this election, that if I had run for the House in the district where I
lived, I would have gotten like 49.5% of the vote. At large, districts
over large areas which probably at that time wasn’t even as large as
Wake is now, are bad policy. We’re asking you to do it, get it right,
for Wake County, under the constitution, this may be a shock to some of
the people who spoke. Section 3 of our Declaration of Rights gives the
people of this state, that’s you, inherent sole and exclusive right of
regulating the internal government of North Carolina. Article 2, Section
24, Declaration of Rights, says no local bills on certain subjects, this
ain’t one of them. And then Section 7 specifically gives the authority
to the General Assembly to regulate elections for counties. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barefoot to address the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the reason why I’m
running this bill is because I represent all the towns that don’t have
any representation on the Wake County Commission. Wake Forest,
Roseville, ?? Zebulon, Windell, Garner, Willow Spring, ?? Marina. And so
that’s why I’m here before you, and Mr. Gilkerson and I have worked at
polls together and we’ve known each other for years and enjoyed that
relationship. But the reality is that the people in my district are very
afraid that if we don’t change how we do elections in Wake County, they
will not be represented

out this week and we&#39;ve had 100,000 people move in to this county
between 2010 and 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson, would you approach the dais please? Members, the
discussion at the dais, Representative, oh, the Chair would like, on
behalf of Chairman Jones, the Chair would like to extend a welcome to
Representative Jackson who Speaker Moore pointed to the Committee on the
elections today. The discussion at the dais was that Representative
Jackson and Representative Gill had entered an identical amendment and
after conferring with the amendment sponsors, Representative
Jackson&#39;s amendment that was identical to Representative Gill&#39;s
is going to be returned and not be considered. But at this time we will
move in to conversation and consideration on the amendments that are
sent forward. The Chair is going to begin with Representative
Jackson&#39;s amendment numbered S181-AST-24 Version Two. It begins
Representative Jackson moves to amend the bill on page one, lines 2-3.
Representative Jackson, first of all do all members have copies of
Representative Jackson&#39;s amendment S181-AST-24 Version Two,
including the bill sponsors? Representative Jackson, you have the floor
to explain your amendment, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, this first amendment
simply, if you&#39;re looking at your colored map that&#39;s entitled
Wake County School Board Districts SL 2013 110, if you&#39;re looking at
your map and you&#39;re trying to figure out what the big, thick, black
lines squiggled around precincts in the middle of the county is it&#39;s
setting up two, it&#39;s termed at-large districts. Now, we can debate
whether it&#39;s truly at-large if it doesn&#39;t include the whole
county, but it&#39;s two districts. One is which is clearly designed to
be a republican district and one is clearly designed to be a democratic
district. I see all kinds of problems with these districts. The outside
district B, you would represent, no matter what corner of the county you
lived in, you&#39;d have to drive the entire county but half of your
trip through would not be in your district and that just, it just makes
no sense to me. So this first amendment will not mess with the numbered
districts, one through seven, but it would get rid of district A and B
so they would truly be only district representation. Representative Stam
or Senator Barefoot to address...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We would oppose the amendment. You heard the debate today about the
various, Trinity and the other places, I&#39;ve heard no objection from
the people to increasing the size of our commission from seven to nine
with a million people here. These districts, the overlay was done for
the school board because a lot of people wanted to vote on at least two
members of the school board because maybe they don&#39;t get along with
one. So here, they have two. Every person votes for two people, an
individual district and then an overlay district so they feel better
about it. We would ask you to defeat the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion or debate on amendment AST-24? If not, the
question before the committee is the adoption of the amendment sent
forward by Representative Jackson numbered AST-24 Version Two. Those
favoring the amendment will say aye, those opposing will say no. In the
opinion of the Chair, the no&#39;s have it and the amendment fails.
Members, next up will be an amendment from Representative Jackson
numbered S-181-AST-25 Version One. It reads, to begin, Representative
Jackson moves to amend the bill on page one, lines 14-16. Do all members
have

Copies, so Representative Jackson you have the floor to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen this amendment would just
make the two at large seats truly at large and so you would have the
nine districts that Representative Stam mentioned that was a good reason
to have the overlay in fact instead of be and blessed with the ability
to vote for two of your members, you would did now on amendment, you
would be blessed with voting for three County Commissioners. I think the
diving precincts and everything of this map for the two at larges just
is very un-workable, you basically have two people running at large the
whole county and lot of confusion about who is aware and so my amendment
would just make the true the A and B, truly at large county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman we would ask the members to defeat the amendment for
couple of reasons. First of all, it introduces confusion because the
School Board elections happening at the same time will no longer be in
sank with these and people do get confused about who is running for
what. Secondly, we do have these larger districts to have a broader few
of things but it still have the population of the entire thing, you
cannot raise enough money for a County Commissioner raise to really
affect, to really affect the vote when you have a million people that
you are running for that you are appealing to. Instead as it happened
before, it’s a lot of outside money, a lot of over influence by the
paper, it’s twice as expensive to run amongst the million people as
amongst a half of million people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson is on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. If I could just respond to Representative Stam,
Wake County is a very large county and unfortunately, our media market
is not designed as the proposed map. So running a district of 500,000 in
the inter part of Raleigh is not gonna be cheaper than running that
larger county because the television is gonna cost you the same amount
of money. The radio bias gonna cost you the same amount of money, the
way this map is drawn you are gonna have to run cable television and
basically every municipality, if you live on the outside other than
Raleigh is not gonna save you that much money. So I think the true at
large is the way to go and I would ask for the member support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale is on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What are the numbers in these two districts, A and B and how they
compare?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale are you directing to Representative Stam, can
you, first staff address that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m directing to ?? the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are all within like 4.8% of the ideal district I mean they are
approximately equal. One is 4.9% below the medium; one is 4.9% below
correctly with the additional 100,000 people that we have gotten in the
last year or two. They are probably now equal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But just because where the growth is…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam to be clear because I think the Chair just to be
clear the amendment Representative Jackson send forward, I believe
Representative Speciale was asking about the numbered districts this
amendment is for actually the Jackson at large, so it creates two at
large, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, what is the question Representative Speciale?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These A and B, are those not the at large districts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Half of the county at large, half of the county at large, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I then I wanted to know how they compared number wise with people?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Approximately, the more equal now than they were so they are
approximately 50-50, 500,000 probably by next, 2016 there will be
probably another 100,000 people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson is on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I can answer Representative Speciale&#39;s question Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s on the page 2 of nine of your data pack, District 1 has 472,000
residents, District 2 only has 428,000 residents. So you have got a
difference about 45, 000 residents, about 10%...

the amendment, the amendment submitted by Representative Jackson AST-25
version one. So many as favor the amendment will signifiy by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Those oppose will signify by saying no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No!
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Nos have it and the amendment is not adopted.
Representative Jackson will let you rest for a minute. Representative
Gil is recognized to submit S181-AST-19 version 3. It begins
Representive Gil moves to moves to amend the bill on page one lines ten
through thirteen. Lady is recognized to explain her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. This amendment is asking that we
make this a referendum and allow the citizens of Wake County on whether
they want this change or not. It’s just the simple referendum bill. And
the reason for this is because you heard from quite a few citizens of
Wake County and they are asking that we allow them to vote. And it’s the
fairness. We’ve heard it talked about on the floor. And in here this
afternoon, that we should give the citizens of Wake County the
opportunity to make a decision on whether they want to change the way
they vote for county commissioners or not. So it’s the simple, give the
people the choice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I would ask you to not agree to the amendment.
Some time we do referendum sometimes we don’t. The effect of the
referendum however, is that the referendum would be in November of
sixteen. Which would mean you would begin the process in eighteen. It
would be fully implemented in twenty. And the people would start serving
the term really for in twenty-twenty-one. I’m too old for that. So I
would ask you to defeat that. We also have a problem of course, that we
had the phenomena of about five or six million dollars of out-of-state
money pouring in here last time. Which the folks that want to do this
can of course do that again, unanswered. And it’s just not appropriate
for ??. The people opposing it, most of them don’t really disagree with
the districts. They don’t really disagree with the increase of number.
It’s just that they don’t like the districts. But the districts are what
they are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gil on the amendment, and then
Representative Torbett and Representative Harrison. Representative Gil
on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to respond to something Representative
Stam said. Of many being poured into Wake County, was not necessarily
for the county commissioners. But we know what the money was for. So we
don’t need to talk about money being poured in, because I think your
going to get contributions from a lot of different sources. And that
does either make or break a campaign. But I think if the citizens of the
county voted for the elected officials then they truly believe that
these are the best candidates and that they will serve the county well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett on the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry on chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we discussing the ability to raise funds or are we
discussing the equalization and the fairness making ever attempt to have
the constituents and the electorate out there represented as fair as
possible or this has no basis on fundraising. Am I missing something Mr.
Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the chair will take that as a point of order and
the chair will simply redirect the conversation and the committee. The
committee is considering an amendment submitted by the lady for Wake
which essentially calls for a referendum AST-19 version three. The chair
won’t comment. The chair will do a better job of controlling the make
sure the debate stays on the subject. Representative Harrison on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to speak in
favor of the amendment. We heard a lot of comments from the public about
how they feel about this. There seems to be pretty strong feeling on
both sides and if

does is it says were only gonna have county commissioner elections for

will we have the most voter turnout filming no stack it will mess with
the AMD 01277 to court approval with backs on the wind will blow still
would have the same
effect, but it will allow the most people have their voice heard on the
elections can and so, does the public health and fitness person scramble
the amendment thank
you and I do not appreciate where to get some more in the comedian Paul
is a worthy adversary (SPEAKER CHANGES) I mean everything and we&#39;ll
work together 15 of what this does is very
different than our school board built two years ago where we went from
the five year while low turnout to even years and it was a presidential
it was general election
for some on one of general it, but forties of almost 161820 but this
does it and it&#39;ll cause we want to do that, two years ago we
extended the terms by one year before
he had to do that again on the right side but this what this does is
take the board is elected for four year term begins six year term as not
right pocket support
this and many courses it gives the people who would be that the bill
allows to run at large again and 16 for those treated for use in warrior
terms at large which is
just what we&#39;re trying to not been refining a district elections so
are all the amendments this is one I understand believes on Chairman
Jones only member IQ of
question for represented Jackson if he will you, Jamie and welcome a
buffer into the elections committee out understated to say that this
would allow for more people
to be borrowed 54 the commissioners if they were all running in a
presidential election year, I know fund is something we&#39;re not been
a may not have we, as a bell all
pastors something mixes that did some voters out there cannot Bennett
said during presidential election year server does not everyone still
have that opportunity in
all key relations is there are we missing something understand more
people cheese to do that for whatever reason but mom, is there reason
that some people are unable
to come out and bang for their commissioners are with staggered terms
are based Warner vision research and supports parental battering, there
is nothing that
pervades the same number of people from voting and 28 teams voted 26.
However at the we can all agree that turnout is better in presidential
elections early voting
is something I use more days are we a more sites in Wayne County and
uses more convenient to speak to be a better turnout by the window, but
neither company would
forbid they think people are voting one thing at which they all wore
user further discussion and debate over to the food from questionable
resistance. Resisting the
German version one of the bitter cold fusion you can help mission if
they choose to turn one year and the Lakers cycle regional war two years
ago is our soul but the
same mistake and cannot be great ( SPEAKER CHANGES) if it is time that
didn&#39;t come to some point cycle is with generous to do with being .
And would not be in order to get into some
kind of like a war story, here&#39;s the reason for SMS places lawmakers
and expansion but secondly more importantly the reason we expanded of
school board was to get it
all for V5 year which is extremely low turnout into even years but even
with him on presidential are fairly good turnout and 20 working follows
a big difference
follow the chairman&#39;s recognized the questions is yes and no used a
minute for one year and so the question you you&#39;ll want to spend for
two years is that the CIA

  and I always say it&#39;s not up to the lawyer to say the answer.
There&#39;s a big difference between extending one year to get it into a
high turnout cycle and extending it two years to not get it into a much
higher cycle. So I would ask the committee not to agree to this
amendment.

there was an additional amendment from Representative Jackson that was

amendment from Representative Gill. We now move to an amendment from
Representative Gill numbered S181-AST-21 version 3. Representative Gill,
you are recognized to explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. You know, this is the third
time in five years that a redistricting map has been before this
assembly. It should be obvious by now that the citizens of Wake County
are willing to elect the best candidates for the job regardless of their
affiliation. If they don&#39;t like the way you govern, they&#39;ll vote
you out. And this can be seen over the past four County Commissioner
elections. But what I&#39;m presenting to you today is a fair way of
doing if we are going to go to the seven districts and two at large. And
if you look at the map that you have before you, you can see it, it has
all of the colors and then it has A B. If you look at this amendment, it
addresses three major problems with Senate Bill 181. One, it drastically
reduces the population deviation among the districts. In the seven
districts that are in Senate Bill 781, there is a deviation of about
7.8%, and in the two lettered districts, there is a population variation
of about 9.8. If you look at the maps that I have given you, you will
notice that the deviation is less than--that makes it 10%. No district
in this drawing is more than 1% larger than the other district. This
means that the voters in each district would have votes of equal weight
regardless of where they live in the county. And if you notice, we tried
to put the eastern counties together, and it does not look like the map
that the original bill sponsors proposed. Even though it is a proposed
Wake County School Board District map that has not been approved, I
think the map that I&#39;m presenting to you today, drawn up by a group
of nonpartisan individuals who are saying that this may be a better map
to look at, you will notice that all of the municipalities are in areas
and all of the districts are compact in such a way that you have
similarities of districts and you do not have them all centered around
Raleigh. Senate Bill 81 proposes districts that would deviate the value,
devalue the vote of the urban residents while inflating the value of the
suburban and rural residents. And Senate Bill 181 would pack minority
voters into a single minority majority district, majority minority
district in which the value of these votes would be diminished. Two, the
amendment keeps communities together. And if you notice that Senate Bill
181 splits 21 precincts across Wake County, and the proposed map that I
have given you

seemed like me this is a win women students seriously consider from

with some precincts if you now been superimposed dismount one what will
already be in the election of 20001611 infinite variety of ballots files
you will have to
hold voter confusion PO Board election confusion and it will be a
warrior problem this is a wall food bank will make them a standard fare
for if you would serve,
version 12 to 01 to present more secure niche for the death of their
final weeks of how the maximum able to be convincing about competing wax
is the amended proposal
which one do you recommend for a king, to share will speak to their of

different one of the things up from two to office process expression
from my constituents to go from

you&#39;ve got to use me and Sheldon into madness than 1% deviation you
get no script precincts, which is one for the known issues with the

this has miss chains,

…On the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and Representative Stam and Senator Barefoot if
you would correct me if I’m wrong, I have spent a good part of the
interim, I’m trying to divide up growing county for equal representation
throughout the county for a County Commissioner and in the end I found
after doing an overlay of 13, 14 years of County Commissioner’s
representation we didn’t need that but what I did find out in the
process and I think what you alluded to or actually said, when you look
at Representative Gills map and having done this on the county, I will
recommend you on getting the quality statistically that to
Representative Stam’s point and talking with my local board of election
to do a ballot where you are going to do the board of elections on the
same ballot that you are gonna do the County Commissioner or whatever,
even looking at this map, look at area 2 in the green, you would be
voting, you have to have the ballot configuration where you have that
large person from A on the ballot with part of what’s on the ballot for
two and also six. And again, you get another precincts for the different
configuration at two year point, am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is my point, is it would be in any given precinct you would have to
have maybe a dozen different ballots styles by that I mean different
people for different people in the precinct because they will be voting
for different districts so that’s why we tried so hard and I’m gonna
make the confession, not a legal confession, no it’s nothing illegal.
Senator Barefoot, what districts to propose, we would straight to the
ones that were already approved by the court, we never look that who the
incumbent was and I never looked at the stats. I never to this day had
looked at the stats to find out because I knew it already been approved
by the Federal District Court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In putting together this map we didn’t look at the incumbents, we never
look at incumbents, we decided that we look at the population and see if
we could equally divide the county into seven districts. And then we
looked at the map and decided on how we could best divide the map so
that individuals would be able to look at a glance and see who they
would be voting for, I think that the alternative map that has been
presented today will give voters a great idea of what district they live
in and who they would be voting for. If you look at the Wake County
School Board district maps you will notice that this is not only divide
precincts but it divide the municipality and if you are talking about
the number of ballots that the Board of Election is going to have to
have the map that we have for the Wake County School Board is certainly
gonna give them a challenge. I think that if we are going to do it we
knew to look at it and do it fairly. This map is a proposed map for the
Wake County School Board and it has not been approved, it’s still on
appeal. I believe that if we look at the alternative map you will see
that it clearly gives and tries to stay within the guidelines of the
election or the guidelines for voting. The equal protection clause of
the 14th amendment that guarantees every person vote would be treated
equally. I think if you look at the alternative map you will notice that
it will work to make sure that each person’s vote will be treated
equally. And that each of the districts are equally represented and even
though you know the old argument that we have heard all along is that
Raleigh is so big that you can’t get elected without having Raleigh. So
we divided Raleigh in such a way that it has a nucleus but the outside
precincts are contiguous…

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Carlton Adams, and of course I think we&#39;ve got the
Chief Sergeant-At-Arms here somewhere, Garland, he&#39;s-well at least
we had him for a long time and he did a great, he did a great job
tonight. Members, it&#39;s the Chair&#39;s intent at this time to
recognize Representative Stam for a motion on the adoption of the Senate
Bill and we will then see if there&#39;s further discussion or debate.
Representative Stam is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes thank you. Paraphrasing Thomas More right before
he was executed, Representative Floyd has commanded me to be brief, and
brief I shall be. I move for a favorable report for Senate Bill 181.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam has moved that Senate Bill 181 be
given a  favorable report. Is there further discussion or debate on the
motion?  The ayes and nos having been called, the Chair will assume that
call is sustained, and, hold one moment. Is there further discussion or
debate on the motion from the gentleman from Wake to give Senate Bill
181 a favorable report? Seeing none, members the question before the-the
Chair apologizes. The Chair recognizes the lady from Wake,
Representative Gill to speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want you all to know before you vote that
Representative Stam thinks my maps are well-designed, and I think that
he would vote for them. That means they&#39;re well-designed when
they&#39;re prettier. And that he would have considered them if I had
given them earlier. You let me go last, I should have gone first. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there further discussion or debate on the motion
from the gentleman from Wake to give Senate Bill 181 a favorable report?
Seeing none, the question before the Committee is the motion from
Representative Stam to give Senate Bill 181 a favorable report. Those
who favor the motion to give Senate Bill 181 a favorable report will say
aye when their name is called. If the Chair could continue, those that
favor will say aye when their name is called. Those opposing will say no
when their name is called. The clerk will call the roll.

people are eating is unusual, so we will pause for just a moment.
