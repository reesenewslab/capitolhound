House committee will please come to order members take your seat as
always we would like to welcome and thank our ??? Chad Turlington
Cameron Flora ??? Williams and Corey Loris i can't say that word thank
you so much for being with us  our house sergeant of arms staff Marvin
lee Carlton Adams Jesse Hayes and Martha perish. Thank you for your
service of course to the committee  staff and to our social staff as
well, we have a very full agenda today and chairs and tenants to  try to
move through it so with that representative Ross is the lady ready to
present the proposed committee substitute for house bill 918 if not we
can come back the chair apologizes if that caught you off guard there is
proposed committee substitute for House bill 918 representative Michelle
has moved that the proposed committee substitute be before the committee
for discussion is their objections seem none so ordered representative
Ross you are recognized to explain proposed committee substitute for
bill 918 [Speaker Change] thank you very much Mr. Chairman I'm going to
give kind  of a broader overview of this spell and where it came from
but I would like that on staff to go through kind the line by line
changes even thought representative Stan doesn't like that I will let
the staff elaborate how is that as necessary this bill alters the
current reporting schedule for independent expenditures and
electioneering communications and the only difference in the PCS is that
it corrects some internal cross citations and clarifies that referendum
election should not be included in the special or should be included in
the special reports whenever necessary and that it makes some conforming
in clarifying organizational changes this was really a lot of this came
from recommendations from the state Board of elections and from the good
government community to make sure that we have reporting at times when
it can actually help the public so some of our reporting happens after
the events have happened and the public hasn't had that kind of
information our new head of the state Board of elections can strap was
very involved in doing the drafting on this and I'm pleased that we have
bipartisan cosponsors and I'll leave it to the staff for any particulars
I appreciate your support [Speaker change] Representative ??? will you
please state your purpose [Speaker Change] I'm looking for my PC it's
right behind the bill summary [Speaker Change] The chair would like to
ask the sergeant of arms to take representative Mobley of proposed
committee substitute of house bill 918 representative Ross before we ask
staff do members desire further explanation of this bill [Speaker
Change] ????????????????? representative Ross you  mention about
reporting prior to offer the elaborate [Speaker Change] Here is a
perfect example Rep. Floyd on page 2 of the bill when you're talking
about independent expenditures and again this is not this is not members
reporting this is independent expenditures and electioneering
communications so these are basically all those outside groups on both
sides and how they you know people don't necessarily know what they're
doing and when they're doing it so it's going to require the reporting
to be at slightly different times so for example the initial report for
independent expenditures so these are people that are not coordinated
with candidates they are just people who work under these issue oriented
people who go out there and say and they can say vote for and vote
against because their independent expenditures but they are not
coordinated that they're going to have to rather than within 30 days of
incurring an expense they're going to have to start doing reports within
10 days of incurring an expense so you know they start to go on</p>

I'm going to recognize Representative Jones to offer a motion.
Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I move for a favorable report for the proposed
committee substitute for House Bill 918, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and Gentleman, Representative Jones has moved the proposed
committee substitute for House Bill 918 be given a favorable report,
unfavorable to the original bill.  Is there any further discussion or
debate? Seeing none, those in favor of the motion please signify by
saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye

Those  who oppose the motion, signify by saying no.  In the opinion of
the Chair the ayes have it and the motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, if you don't object, we are going to display 919
for just a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At this time we are going to move into House Bill 311.  There is a
Proposed Committee Substitute for House Bill 311.  The Chair would like
to recognize Representative Alexander, Warren, Jeter and Michaux if they
would like to speak on this but before that Representative Michaux does
move that the Proposed Committee Substitute for House Bill 311 be before
the committee for consideration.  Is there objection?  Seeing none, it
is so ordered. Representative Alexander, you have the floor to explain
House Bill 311.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is truly a bipartisan measure designed to
take out of our constitution a measure that was put in the late 1800's,
around 1898 or 1899, thereabouts, it's been in our constitution ever
since.  It only had one reason it was put in there and that was
initially to suppress the black vote.  We have had a tremendous amount
of progress over the ensuing century and it is about time, we believe,
to reflect that progress by changing the constitution
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pardon me, Representative.  Representative Floyd, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.  As soon as the gentleman completes his remarks.  You have the
floor, Representative Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My only, the last thing I was going to say was, the bill would have this
put before the voters in 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the interest of time, the Chair is going to move to the Committee at
this time.  Representative Floyd, I believe you wish to offer a motion.
Are there any inquiries or comments on the bill.  If not, Representative
Floyd you are recognized for the purpose of offering a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move for favorable report for House Bill 311.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd has moved that the Proposed Committee Substitute
for House Bill 311 be given a favorable report, unfavorable to the
original bill.  Was there further discussion or debate?  Seeing none,
those who favor the motion will signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those who oppose will signify by saying no.  In the opinion of the
Chair, the ayes have it and the motion carries. Congratulations,
Representative.  At this time we are going to again move on the agenda
to House Bill 794, if Representative Saine is here?  Representative
Saine, Representative Luebke.  There is a proposed committee substitute,
we will hold that for a moment to allow the bill sponsor to speak on
House Bill 794.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You do have House Bill 794 in front of you
which is the Voter Freedom Act of 2013.  If you are not familiar with
it, this is very similar to other legislation that has passed the House
prior. Basically, it is about ballot access.  We believe that ballot
access is a fundamental right, that all parties should have a right to
be heard, be at the table, during our elections.  North Carolina's
current ballot access laws, the second most restrictive in the nation,
impose an excessive and unreasonable requirement on new political
parties and unaffiliated candidates sits far and above the standard
prevalent in most other states.  These laws also deny citizens their
right to vote for the candidates of their choice, their right to run for
office and their right to freedom of association to form alternative
political parties to place candidates on the ballot and freedom of
conscious</p>

Thank you mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Riddell. At this time, we're going to move to House bill
951, House bill 951, and Representative, chair will recognize
Representative Riddell to present House bill 951. You have the floor
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Friends on the committee, this is a very
simple bill you have before you. The bill actually is smaller than the
PCS that goes with it. You may remember from April fifteenth on your tax
form there is this check off for you to designate three dollars of your
taxes to go to one of three political parties, the Democrat, the state
Democrat political party, the state Republican political party or the
state Libertarian political party. You can also designate other, and
those funds will be bundled together and then distributed by a prorated
ratio. What this bill would do is eliminate that three dollar check off
box for the North Carolina Republican Party, North Carolina Democratic
Party, North Carolina Libertarian Party and just eliminate the program
completely. It's my opinion and I hope it will be yours, the majority
opinion, that the state of North Carolina has no business soliciting
money on behalf of political entities. That is not a proper scope for
state government. There are many things a state government needs to do,
and should do well, but being the solicitor for political parties is not
one of them. So that's the very brief explanation of this very simple
bill and I'll be happy to try to entertain any questions the committee
might have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill and ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may debate the bill and then ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My debate is great bill, thank you. My question is this, how much will
this save for the general fund per year, if anybody knows.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair is gonna direct that to staff and they may need just a moment to
pull up the ??. We're gonna get that for you, Representative Stam, if we
can get back to that. Is there further, are there further members
seeking recognition? Yes sir, please state your purpose. All right,
let's hold that just for a moment, we could get the answer to
Representative Stam's inquiry. Representative Stam, with your indulgence
could the chair direct staff to send that out to all of the members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be fine. My vote is not dependent on it, I just wanted to try
to spend that money elsewhere.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I wanna clarify, the three dollars you are talking about
comes from the taxes that are due to the state. It's deducted from the
individual's taxes that they would pay, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I really like this bill, and I like it even more because of a group that
visited my office recently who were lobbying to get a check off for
contributions to their organization, but they made very clear that they
did not want it to come from the taxes. They want it to come from the
refund. And it sheds a  whole new light on check off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think you need a correction on that. The money is not taken from the
taxpayer in this situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we'll do is direct that to staff, and staff can, staff can correct
the chair. It's chair's understanding that the money is appropriated, it
doesn't affect what the taxpayer pays in, just what goes out. Is that
correct? Is that addressed? All right, further discussion or debate.
Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair, I just wanted a little bit of background from the staff if
possible about when we put this in place and maybe what other states do.
Are we unique in this or</p>

also previously reviewed by on this track and what this does is it from
requires electronic filing of certain campaign finance reports on a
candidate campaign committees on the other political committees and
basically ERS you have more than $5000 are your campaign when you have
to file electronically and for other political committees it's something
more than $10,000 they need to file electronically I would just tell you
personally this issue has come up over and over and over again since
I've been hearing the general assembly in the past IE on a polished it
because the board of elections was equipped to take all the electronic
filing suit was very frustrating and Mike Frazier and columns I change
my first pressure was an ITI NE had problems filing it but now I think

Where it's not supported for Mac users. We have contracted with a vendor
however and that is part of what they are supposed to provide us is the
ability for all users, especially Mac users...
[Speaker Changes] ??
[Speaker Changes]
Including Mac users, to be able to use the software. It's not available
currently. It's supposed to be available this year. I will tell you that
is part of the proposal and it's one of the big reasons why we wanted to
change the software.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Harrison, just to make you aware if you look at the line
23 of the PCS, it doesn't become effective until January 1st, 2014. So,
it gives the whole year to kind of get things worked out.
[Speaker Changes]
Ms. Drakus, Chair, [inaudible] Do you anticipate that the update to
accept Mac or Ios software will be in place by January 1st 2014.
[Speaker Changes]
I certainly hope so. I certainly hope so. We're working with the vendor.
And that is what they have told us that it will be ready by that time
and that is what we are expecting.
[Speaker Changes]
If I could follow up on that. That sanguin attitude that what if its not
ready and those of us who have Macs. Is there some way to put some
language in here that just qualifies that software is available for all
computer types? Would that be inappropriate.
[Speaker Changes]
I think the bill sponsor agrees with that approach. I think they're
trying to decide how to address your concern. Let me recognize Rep. Ross
to respond to that.
[Speaker Changes]
We don't want anyone to get in trouble simply because of technology. So
what we can do is we can work on an admendment for the floor with the
board of elections and Rep. Harrison if you want to work on that, that's
completely fine. It won't be on the floor probably until next week and
so, that'd be great.
[Speaker Changes]
The chair has Rep. Speciale, Rep. Jones, and Rep. Floyd. So Rep.
Speciale?
[Speaker Changes]
I'm just curious why $10,000 for other political commitees, instead of
$5,000. The suggestion is to delay it until 2015. That should give them
time to fix that Mac problem.
[Speaker Changes]
Just the second point, I think our feeling is that it needs to be in
place 2014. It's unfortunate that it's not Mac compatible, but that's a
minority of users and so we'll carve out that exception for them. ???
[Speaker Changes]
We could lower it if you wanted too. The other political commitees
aren't necesarily subjected to as much kind of public scrutiny as we
are, but if you wanted to lower it I wouldn't have an objection unless
the Board of Elections has an objection. The idea was just that if they
were at less than $10,000 they weren't actually probably doing as much,
and so that was why we had it at $10,000.
[Speaker Changes]
Rep. Floyd?
[Speaker Changes]
I just had some concerns about electronic reporting. I also have some
concerns, but you addressed that partly about January 2014. Given IT
experience that I've seen here around Raleigh, we just don't meet them
dates. We just don't meet them. So I think that pushing it out further
with a confirm date, then just, perhaps as Rep. Harrison mentioned about
whenever, but we need to push it back. So that we know firmly. Six
months out, July, whatever, but IT here just don't work as well as it
should.
[Speaker Changes]
Well, we're going to work with Rep. Harrison on an amendment that deals
with people who have some kind of technological impediment to complying,
but given that 2014 is a big election all the way around and people are
going to be very interested in it to the extent that people can comply.
I think that the public has a right to be able to have access to this
information. Again, I think that it will help the candidates. Because,

[Speaker changes.]...for format and things like that but when you have
to do it electronically, it really does help you and your treasurer
comply and then you won't have to come back...and you...I mean it's
really an advantage to do it this way in terms of compliance.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Mister Chair.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[Speaker changes.] My concern...the definite time...about January 1,
2014. The window's too short. IT it and ????????? just don't function.
Any IT program we try to put together just don't meet the target date.
[Speaker changes.] Well, Representative Floyd, we already have it in
place for everybody except for the MAC folks so that's...
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Mister Chair.
[Speaker changes.] This 2014 just let's not be the date that I would
like to see given the IT concern that we have had round here in Raleigh.
 Whether it's MAC, ac, tac or whatever. It just doesn't ????? it.
[Speaker changes.] Alright, Representative Floyd, the Chair ????? ?????
Blust.
[Speaker changes.] Question for Representative Luebke, won't making this
a requirement suppress the number of people who can run for office and
create barriers?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Blust, the Chair is going to assume
you ask that...?????
[Speaker changes.] Representative Faircloth.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman.  I'm not trying to
belittle an issue at all but electronically could mean if I go on the
state site, pull down the form, type in the information and then email
it back. That's electronically as well.  Do we need to define that it's
a particular system used...or whatever.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Faircloth, the Chair apologizes.  Did
you wanna direct that to staff or the bill sponsors or...
[Speaker changes.] Representative Ross or Representative Luebke, do you
have a response or would you like to think about it and come back to it?
[Speaker changes.] Well, what I say is...and maybe this isn't clear
enough...I'll defer to staff but if you look at Line 21, it says
&quot;the State Board of Elections shall provide the software to file an
electronic report to the Treasurer required to file the report at no
cost to the Treasurer&quot; and so that does give the implication that
there's a particular kind of software. But, if you wanna clarify that,
that's just fine with me.
[Speaker changes.] Representative McNeill? Representative Starnes.
[Speaker changes.] Well, I may be the only person in here that doesn't
like this so good. (Laughter.) But it might be me and it might be
you...I don't know but somebody's gonna be in there in your home tryin'
to fill out your report the night before it's due and somethin's not
workin' right and you can't figure it out and there's no provision...you
know how to fill it out on a piece of paper, mail it in, get it
postmarked but you don't know how to get it to work on the computer and
somebody's goin to get fined because they just didn't have the knowledge
or maybe their computer crashed or for whatever reason... so I'm just
warnin' ya. Somebody's gonna get fined for havin' late reports just
because they aren't comfortable using computers and I might be the one.
[Speaker changes.] May I address that, Mister Chair.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Ross.
[Speaker changes.] Just to be clear...also...it has to be filed
according to the rules adopted by the State Board of Elections on Line 9
and I don't know whether the State Board of Elections has a rule for
slightly late filings or things like that. I would defer to Ms. ???????
We could certainly ask them to have a rule about ...and maybe put it
even and put in Representative Harrison's amendment that, if there's a
computer. You know, if they don't have the software for MAC or if
there's some kind of computer error that you have a certain number of
days to file it.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Bryan.
[Speaker changes.] Representatives Ross and Luebke, I wanna thank you.
My Treasurer asked me to do about three things and this is one of the
three things he asked me to get done.  I have a feeling you guys won't
be able to help me with the other two but I appreciate your help on this
one.  Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Well, you could help us with a motion. (Soft
laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Further discussion on the bill. If not,
Representative Bryan moves that the proposed Committee Substitute for
House Bill 919 be given a favorable report; unfavorable to the original
bill. Is there further discussion or debate on the motion? Seeing none,
those who favor the motion to get....</p>

With House Bill 99, excuse me, the proposed Committee Substitute for
House Bill 919 to favorable, the court will signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those who oppose will signify by saying no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.  The motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair has been made aware there is a large
amendment on House Bill 65 and the Chair does not deem that there is
enough time to thoroughly vet this bill.  Therefore, there being no
further business this Committee stands adjourned.</p>
