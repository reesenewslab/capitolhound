[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate.  We went through
this in some detail in Rules this morning.  I will try to limit the
comments, which is kind of unusual in the context of a technical bill,
but we&#39;ll try to do that quickly.  The first seventeen sections...
or the first sixteen sections you&#39;ve already seen.  They came from
the General Statutes Commission.  They were passed by this body, oh,
probably two months ago.  The next several pages, sections
seventeen...okay... Section...I just got word from my good friend
Senator Blue that I can speed it up.  I will try to do that.  I happen
to have a cheat sheet.  Makes it a little....  [AUDIO ENDS]

  <p>Speaker 1: …to do that too. The next section are technical and I
consider it to be just that, and meant to be just that, and hopefully
are. The third section, beginning with section 27.8 are other changes,
some of which are technical, most of which are clarifying, but probably
some substantive provisions, which, I would suggest you take a look at.
I can go through those in some detail if someone asks. There are some of
these sections that since this particular matter was adopted by the
rules committee that upon further review there are some amendments and
some deletions because of some issues, but I do not have that particular
amendment as of yet Mr. President. I would suggest that if it would be
possible if we could just displace this that would give the opportunity
for the members to review the bill as it is and we will have the
amendment shortly.
Mr. President: Senator?
Speaker 2: Mr. Chair, two motions please.
Mr. President: Make your motions.
Speaker 2: I move that we displace house bill 92 while folks have an
opportunity to review this, perhaps put it at the end of the subpenal
calendar?
Mr. President: Without objection, so ordered.
Speaker 2: Second motion. I would like to move that Senate Bill 353 be
brought before us for immediate consideration.
Mr. President: Without objection, so ordered: Senate Bill 353 – motion
to concur.
Clerk: Senate Bill 353, Health and Safety law changes.
Mr. President: Senator Daniels is recognized to explain the motion.
Speaker 2: Thank you Mr. President, Member of the Senate. In early July
we passed most of the provisions of this bill and house bill, page 695.
We had two days of vigorous debate then. Rather then concur with the
bill, they referred it to the health care committee. Based on some
suggestions by the health and human services, a few minor changes were
made to the bill in section 4. So, I will just go over those briefly. In
section 4A, under the women’s right to know act changes, the prior
version of the bill required the physician to be present during all
phases of a chemically induced abortion. The change that was made
reduces that requirement to only the first dosage of the chemically
inducing drug and subsequent doses of the drug would not have to be done
in the presence of a physician. The other changes that were made were in
section 4C which was basically at the request of the department: they
wanted some additional some guidance on the rule making process, so that
was the reason for the change in the language. The significance of that
is now any rules that are promulgated by the department will be done so
as not to unduly restrict access to the abortion procedures. One of the
comments Secretary Vas had made in the committee meeting in the house
was that they felt like they perhaps did not have the necessary
resources to inspect abortion clinics on a regular basis; so section 4D
is a new section which is basically a study provision in which the
department is going to study the resources they need in order to, I
guess, carry out their supervisory or enforcement duties under the new
promulgated rules. Those are the substantive portions that were changed
in the bill. I would recommend that we concur with the motion and would
be glad to answer any questions with regard to the changes.
Mr. President: Discussion or debate? Senator, for what purpose do you
rise?
Speaker 3: To speak on the bill.
Mr. President: Senator has the floor.
Speaker 3: We have to talk about facts sometimes even though we do not
like to. So I am going to talk about a few facts. More than 20 years
have passed since the last reported abortion related death in NC. Here
is a person speaking on behalf of this, who says…

  <p>Having an abortion is safer than getting an injection of penicillin.
This is Doctor David Grimes. He&#39;s an OB/GYN who speaks on behalf of
the American Congress of OB/GYNs on this issue. ?? for the Abortion
Surveillance of the Center for Diseased Control. Let&#39;s hear some
facts. Who is against this? The American Academy of Pediatrics, the
American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Surgeons
and the American College of Physicians have all spoken out against rules
like these. Several have spoken about interfering with a patient&#39;s
and a doctor&#39;s relationship. The biggest problem in North Carolina
is that there are not enough staff to adequately inspect these
facilities. Our own secretary of HHS has asked us that if we want to
adequately inspect them, we give her more staff. Why are we studying?
The facts are that those who are most involved are against this bill, as
are many, many citizens. I urge you to vote not to concur.
Speaker Changes: Mr. President?
Speaker Changes: Senator Stein for what purpose do you rise?
Speaker Changes: To debate the motion to concur.
Speaker Changes: The Senator has the floor.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. President. I&#39;d like to follow-up on
Senator Kinnaird&#39;s comments. The fundamental debate is restricting a
woman&#39;s ability to exercise her constitutional right vs what you all
have said is protecting women&#39;s health. Senator Kinnaird identified
a number of medical groups and doctors who&#39;ve spoken on that. What
I&#39;d like to do is just read, briefly, from a letter that we all got
on July 16th from the American Congress of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, North Carolina section, as well as the North Carolina
Obstetrical and Gynecological Society from North Carolina Medical
Society. These folks actually are trained, highly, in promoting
women&#39;s health during reproductive uh, their reproduction. North
Carolina, NCOGS and NCACOG, the two leading statewide professions
associations of OB/GYN physicians believe that this legislation, Senate
Bill 353, interferes with the patient/physician relationship, restricts
the reproductive rights of women, and substitutes ideology for sound
science and medical judgement. Passage of this bill, which is not based
on science, will have a detrimental affect on the women in North
Carolina. It will not benefit women&#39;s health. It will be detrimental
to women&#39;s health. Medical decisions must be between a woman and her
doctor without legislative interference. I suggest we take the
invitation of these physicians and not interfere. Let&#39;s reject this
motion to concur.
Speaker Changes: Mr. President?
Speaker Changes: Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise?
Speaker Changes: To speak on the concurrence.
Speaker Changes: The Senator has the floor.
Speaker Changes: Unfortunately, this bill is coming back to us in a form
that&#39;s not fundamentally changed from the original bill that we saw,
which we considered. In my opinion, it&#39;s a further deprivation of
rights of women. We still have the language here that basically says no
state or local government can offer medical insurance that would offer
abortion coverage regardless what they might decide to do locally.
There&#39;s still language here that basically says when there&#39;s a
private insurance plan offered over health benefit changes that it
cannot offer abortion coverage even though a person might as a matter of
personal consciousness to choose to select a health insurance plan that
might provide that coverage. They aren&#39;t given that option. Yes, Row
vs Wade that Supreme Court decision, the only thing it still does is to
try in every legal way that is conceivable possible to deprive a woman
of that right to choose, that right to make a very personal decision
that was predicated upon the right of privacy, which is Constitutionally
protected. It&#39;s...

  <p>[0:00:00.0]
…Use to undermine where we wait and everyway that they can including and
waiting upon that gender privacy to have a doctor interrogate a woman as
the reason for her abortion to determine if it’s based upon the gender
of her child. We to go through any of this and I personally think about
whether that might be a legitimate reason for someone to accused to go
forward that’s a decision that’s based upon that woman’s personal right
to make a decision and it’s her own privacy we should not ___[00:31]
upon and in terms of regulations is that govern abortion clinics today
within the State if anything based upon information that’s come before
us we can see that those regulations are effective and that they are
working to get there are problem clinics out and those problems are
being addressed in a reasonable rational and in effective way. When we
look today and what this bill does we only think it comes back this
change, it may respects affected if the woman is taking the pill to
terminate that pregnancy issue no longer she can take the first pill in
the presence of the doctor, the subsequent pill she does not that’s
reasonable, that’s rational and should have been the way it would always
occurred. And likewise it gives health and human services, the
Department of Health and Human Services, the right to come up with these
new regulations that will govern abortion clinics but they are still
talking about using the same basic standards for ambulatory surgical
clinics which would effectively close all the abortion clinics in the
State except for one. So, therefore, those limits, those options will be
reduced to one clinic as opposed to that 16 or 17 that exists today. We
are trussing upon the rights and the options of woman in the state that
in my mind is unconstitutional and the goal is simply to under
role___[01:53]  if we can do so within an environment that they believe
it was ___[01:56] scrutiny and with that reason I ask you not to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Members and colleagues, we know that for many
of you here you are philosophically perhaps with the spiritually and
religiously and politically are opposed to a woman’s right to choose and
to choice about her own reproductive rights and freedom even though it
is her constitutional right and I believe her human right. We know that
and it is disingenuous of you and off course all about playing politics
with woman’s lives and with her bodies for you to discuss this
political, philosophical maybe spiritual agenda in the guys of
protecting woman’s health. Are you restricting woman’s access to
reproductive health care in a way that is unacceptable and unsafe and
un-healthy and unconstitutional? You have the majority both to do what
it is you wanna do. So, why these sneak attacks and sneak approaches to
this legislation, why we hear now after this bill is comeback to the
house since July 11th, again we are here at 6 o ‘clock the last day of
the session hearing this bill on a supplemental calendar when you know
that your agenda, your political agenda for woman’s reproductive rights
is out of scale with North Carolinians. But it is important to us that
you and Governor McCrory know and understand that we do not believe or
by this effort discussed that you are working to make woman safer or to
protect their rights. Our rights are not protected by you allowing
healthcare workers who personally oppose abortion to opt-out a
participating in this care even if they are the receptionists, or the
___[04:16] with no exception for whether there is a medical emergency or
not, facing the woman who they, in their moment of conscious denying
abortion coverage to woman and their families to buy health insurance
with their own money is not protecting the health and caring for the
health of woman and the safety of woman. Prohibiting cities and towns
from offering coverage and their abortion plans to their employees as a
part of the compensation for the work of those own employees is not
caring for the health of woman and it is discriminating against woman in
public employment…

  <p>…as against women in private employment. And restricting the access of
women to reproductive health services in our state by allowing your
political appointees to write the restrictions that will apply to their
access to this healthcare is not caring for the rights of women in the
state and is indeed restricting our rights.
So it is important to us that you know that we are not buying this
disguise. Your agenda is clear. And it is clear in the provisions in
this bill. And there is nothing in this bill that helps to protect or
support the rights of women’s healthcare.
This bill completely infringes upon both our human rights and our
reproductive rights and we reject that and ask that you vote not to
concur with this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think our agenda…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby what…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think our agenda is very clear. What have we done this session? I’ve
worked very hard over the last few months and I would have liked frankly
a great deal more assistance and help in fighting for two important
bills.
The first was turning pimps into registered sex offenders. The second
one was the safe harbor legislation that we just passed. The next was
the eugenics…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me Senator Goolsby. Senator Stein, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I earlier tried to get a little bit off topic and was quickly corralled
back in. Is this relevant to this legislation or rather is it on point
to this legislation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He just started. Let’s see where he goes. We’ll keep him tight. I gave
you all quite a bit of leeway also. Carry on Senator Goolsby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. The next was the eugenics legislation that the minority
party had, as I counted, 81 years to fix, to compensate the individuals
who the minority party, which was in power back in 1929 when they
authorized the first forced sterilizations and in 1933 when they created
the Eugenics Board…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, come on, we need to get on a point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll get back to the point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The fact of the matter is I’d like to read you exactly the portion
because there’s a lot of rhetoric that goes on here and I’m trying to
figure out why this is not something that actually goes in line with the
other things that we’ve done protecting women.
The Chiarello law that of course were made fun of for trying to push
through to protect women and their children, but let me just look at
section 4 (c). It says, “The Department of Health and Human Services
shall amend its rules…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…pertaining…” I will not yield for a question until I get finished.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
“The Department of Health and Human Services shall amend its rules
pertaining to clinics certified by the Department to be suitable
facilities for the performance of abortions in accordance with our law
14-45. 1.
“The Department is authorized to provide any requirement for the
licensure of ambulatory surgical units to the standard applicable to
clinics certified by the Department to be suitable facilities for the
performance of abortions.
“The rule shall ensure that standards for clinics certified by the
Department address the on-site recovery phase of the patient care at the
clinic, protect patient privacy, provide quality assurance, and ensure
that patients with complications receive the necessary medical attention
while not unduly restricting access.
“The Department may issue temporary rules in addition to any permanent
rulemaking authority to enforce the subsection.”
Then it goes into the one line about the oversight committee to study
this issue. That’s what we’re talking about.
While a protest was going on in Wilmington a couple of three weeks ago
on this verbiage, another abortion clinic in North Carolina was closed
down, this time I believe it was in Fayetteville where Senator Meredith
resides. That’s in addition to an abortion clinic being closed twice in
Charlotte, another one in Durham.
This is in addition to what we’ve all seen in the news about Dr. Kermit
Gosnell operating in a low-income area, an African-American area in
Philadelphia where he ran a total shop of horrors that shocked the
consciousness.
This bill in the long line of things that we have done over this long
session, simply attempts to make sure that we protect women. The things
I read to you, right there is the sum and substance of what apparently
is the complaint that we want to make sure…

  <p>I like what occurred in Charlotte where a woman went in for a chemical
abortion methotrexate was not put into her body via injection it was
drawn out given to her in a cup and she was told to home.  She went home
came back a month later and she was still pregnant off course
methotrexate has to be injected and then she had to undergo a surgical
abortion.  That clinic suffered the consequences of that through the
Department of Health and Human Services.  And I just ask the party in
the minority what is wrong with reasonable standards that again
specifically state protect the privacy, assure quality, provide quality
assurance, assure patience with complications receive necessary medical
attention.  Not unduly restricted medical access.  In light of the
multiple abortion clinics that have been closed in our state and in
light of what we saw going in Philadelphia?  What&#39;s the matter with
a little bit of reason?  What&#39;s the matter with protecting woman,
just like we&#39;ve tried to do in all the other bills we&#39;ve put
forward that you never bothered to deal with in the past?  What&#39;s
the matter with taking of our women and girls?  Thank you, Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson to what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Golsby a question.[SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator do you yield?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator do you have any health background, any training in that
area? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m a trial litigator I&#39;ve
tried a number of medical cases over the years, but I don&#39;t have a
medical degree, my degrees are in business and law. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Senator?  One other question, Senator Golsby.  Do you yield?
Have you ever witnessed a woman who did not go to an abortion clinic,
but whose body was mutilated by coat hangers that some unscrupulous
person practiced on her in the streets.  Have you ever witnessed that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, Ma&#39;am, I have not.  I did follow the trial of
Dr. Gossmell and all of the horrors that he committed on minority women
because he had a clinic that wasn&#39;t observed and where they
weren&#39;t protected.  I care about women and I think my records very
much shows that with my hard fight against sex trafficking in this state
and to try to protect them and to that constitutional rights of women
and their children are, but if you can show something in here that&#39;s
not reasonable that is wrong, that is going to hurt women I will not
vote for this, I will not vote for this, I&#39;m looking at this
section, I care, I want to do what&#39;s right, I want see that women
are protected, and I&#39;m reading the exact language in here to you,
and I&#39;m not finding it offensive.  I&#39;m just not finding
offensive, Senator.  I don&#39;t see it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak on the
field, Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. I address those questions to Senator Golsby, because
I think about Senator Pircell who was here years ago.  An he was a
provider, he was an OB/GYN, he had taken care of many women in the
state, and he had delivered many babies.  He worked in the rural part of
the state and depressed area.  I have health background. I work with
woman who seek health services and at his point in time a lot of them
don&#39;t get them. If it wasn&#39;t for some other clinics in the area
they would have to rely on unscrupulous people like Senator Golsby
talked talked about.  But because North Carolina has seen fit to put in
place health clinic for women that do have regulations and I would say
that those clinics were closed because we already have regulations and
we don&#39;t need additional legislation.  But because North Carolina
does have regulations and it has clinics where people can go for health
care and for abortions if they deem necessary, that&#39;s a woman&#39;s
choice it&#39;s not your choice, that&#39;s important part, and let me
say a couple of other things about that too.  I talk to  some of the
citizens in my area and one of the men who said, you know, whether
I&#39;m for or against abortions, the very nerve of the General Assembly
to put it on the motorcycle safety ad, he was appalled.  What kind of
shenanigans are we playing here?  You say you care about women and their
health and yet your throw

  <p>A bill that is so critical to a woman&#39;s health under a nebulous
title that has nothing to do with it. It&#39;s a charade. If you really
cared about women&#39;s health, you would ask the women. Now just like
what I said before, in 1848 when women didn&#39;t have any rights, they
also didn&#39;t have any rights about their bodies about abuse and there
were cases of women that were abused by their husbands, these were white
women, cases of women who were abused by their husbands who went to the
judge and he would not stop the man from abusing her. All of that came
about before women had rights. Rights about their bodies, about voting,
about anything, and here we are again. You say you&#39;re concerned
about women&#39;s rights and their health and secure and safe places.
Well, if you were so concerned about them you would expand Medicaid, I
can give you a few more suggestions in terms of how we can make sure
that their place is to take care of health in this state. The bill is
not that. The bill in terms of abortion clinics is not dangerous, the
bill is dangerous. The bill is dangerous because what it does, it
restricts access to the point that the women that I know, some of the
women that you&#39;re talking about ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] From the streets will have to go outside of the
traditional health clinic. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me. [SPEAKER

Point of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER

photography during speeches, is that in the decorum of the Senate.

sorry. If you&#39;ll please continue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. But
it will prohibit women from having access to certified clinics where
there are people who know what they&#39;re doing who are trained and
they will have to go into the streets. Senator Purcell said that to you
several years ago. What we will see in this state because you are
denying access to women to go to safe facilities and make the choice
about their bodies, and you don&#39;t know what happens. You don&#39;t
know what happens, you can&#39;t bear any children. I&#39;m talking to
the men. You can&#39;t bear any children. You know, maybe we ought to
have some things to have some prostate all kinds of other things I can
talk a little more about that next time. I&#39;ll do a bill. But anyway,
you will restrict access for us as women. We don&#39;t need you to make
choices. There is an article from the Dutton Marker Report that talks
about, and this is an author who has done much research on health
issues, on issues about sexual reproductivity, sexually transmitted
diseases, everything. Well known. And it says that the rationale behind
the campaign to single out abortion clinics for special treatment is
that abortion is inherently dangerous, however the facts say otherwise.
Abortion is an extremely safe medical practice. Less than 0.3% of
abortion patients in the United States experience a complication that
requires hospitalization, and the article goes on to cite other relevant
data, however the risk is going to be when access to abortion clinics is
cut off by this General Assembly. That&#39;s where the risk will be. We
will pick up women off the streets. You won&#39;t, because you don&#39;t
live in the neighborhoods and you don&#39;t take care of them and you
don&#39;t care about them, but that&#39;s when the folk that I work with
will pick them up off the streets and either take them to a morgue or
try to get them to an emergency room because you&#39;re denying safe
access to health. And in addition to that does come counseling.
Sometimes a woman doesn&#39;t want it. She thinks maybe she does, but
there are people there to counsel and to talk about what has happened.
Lots of times there are incestuous issues going on, rape, everything,
but they have an opportunity to get the kind of counseling they need and
to make good decisions, but you&#39;re cutting off access is what
you&#39;re doing and determining what regulations clinics should have
and you don&#39;t have the expertise to make that determination. You
don&#39;t have the expertise in terms of what

  <p>Speaker: Is good health care for women because there are lot of other
things we should be doing about woman&#39;s health care and access in
the state and we are doing a very poor job on that finally i have to
support senator stern said about the ?? and there some who are survive
on the board would come on and who talk about this issue on everyday in
terms of what there expertise says they experience how and how this bill
really going to be detrimental for the woman&#39;s in our state and in
all consciousness if you really scared about women and if you really
cared about patient safety you wont have this bill the first thing but
you certainly vote against it,
Speaker Changes: Further discussion further debate senator ?? for what
purpose you ask
Speaker Changes: To speak on the bill Mr.President,
Speaker Changes: The senator has the floor,
Speaker Changes: ?? a question please,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? do you yell,
Speaker Changes: I yell,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? on page 2 last line on 24 of the bill i see
some language does says ?? in providing city insurance employees that
council do not provide an abortion coverage  greater than that provided
by the state health plan for teachers and state employees did you ??
what do you provide abortion coverage under under teacher state
employees,
Speaker Changes: ?? state health plan currently allows abortion coverage
in the case of life insurance and this would merely make the municipal
and county heath coverage consistent with that level of follow up
Speaker Changes: So admit man dating to local government  what kind of
heath care they can provide to their employees is that what this does
Speaker Changes: This bill would make county and municipal health plans
consistent with state health plans yes ,
Speaker Changes: Thank you,
Speaker Changes: To speak on the bill Mr.President,
Speaker Changes: The senator has the floor,
Speaker Changes: Here we ?? we are debating another very critical issue
and looking into the galleries and some of these may city employees or
state employees of women they abandoned a night health care or access
they provide their own health care for reason in terms of our personal
health care and i just think that&#39;s dangerous area to get into and
we continue our members for hearing years and years local government be
shouldn&#39;t get involved in all of a sudden session we want to tell
local government what to do in terms of everything ?? that will be used
on women in the clinic because they cannot get a legal abortion and i
know that in previous debate we heard that there will be just one clinic
in the state of north Carolina that will meet the requirement  and
regulations of that has been proposed and that says we are setting up a
monopoly ?? we against are limiting access to women why to chose and
senator Clark made a very valid point many of us don&#39;t support but
what we don&#39;t support is us what political public servants ?? and
their medical providers i know we got them this bill will pass just all
the other critical negative ?? but again i just want to remind you that
man that ruled over others should rule,

  <p>Trying to get up. You have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. The three clinics in
Charlotte, Durham and Fayetteville were closed under the current
regulations, and I was pleased to be a co-sponsor of Senator Goolsby’s
trafficking bills. I hope the Governor has a Webster’s Dictionary over
in the Capital and that he’ll use it because we’ve already gotten a new
definition of revenue neutral this session. I hope the Governor will
carefully study the word restrictive because he said last Fall he would
veto any abortion regulations that were more restrictive than the
currents, and Bill 353 qualifies. And while the Governor’s reading his
dictionary, I hope he’ll also study the word commitment because that’s
what he made to the women of North Carolina last Fall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask Senator Goolsby a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You mentioned about not seeing what was unfair to
women in this field so this is a question I want to ask you. Do you
think it’s fair to deny a woman in access to insurance coverage, who
lives in a county where that county government is willing to provide
full reproductive healthcare coverage for her, but yet she cannot
purchase that because you oppose her right to choose and within that
limit their ability to provide her that insurance? Do you think it’s
fair to that woman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma’am, I understand fully that the Constitution
according to our Supreme Court under the privacy right allows women to
seek abortions in our country. It does not require anyone, as I
understand it, to pay for those other than the person seeking that
service, and I would also tell you as far as restricting accesses, which
is what you claimed, if everyone would look on the last page of the
bill, page 4 line 35, it specifically says that the department is to
provide a plan and ensure standards that do not unduly restrict access
to abortion. This is a bill about safety. Section 4C is about safety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would ask everyone to please, if I can finish
answering, to please read that and tell me where there’s anything wrong
with protecting women, protecting their patient-privacy, ensuring
quality assurance, ensuring patients with complications to receive
necessary medical attention. All while not unduly restricting access.
There is no requirement here that these be licensed as ambulatory
surgical units. It recognizes surgeries goes on here and allows the
department to apply requirements as it sees fit for surgical centers.
Ma’am, these are surgeries, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong
with protecting women as long as this bill is followed. And it does not
unduly restrict access. That is what it says in the law. Somehow you
can’t read the law. It says there on line 36, and I stand by it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, do you yield to a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If she wants to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll stay here as long as you’ll stay here, and fifty
percent of the abortions are medical abortions and not surgeries, but my
follow-up question is this: Is there any area that you’re aware of where
in state law we restrict the kind of healthcare men can get in terms of
insurance coverage? Any vision that you’re aware of can cite me to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma’am, I’m-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m just not sure what you’re asking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield to another question, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you think it’s fair that a person working in a
healthcare environment, I presume, who because of their conscientious
objection to abortion, it is fair for them not to provide a service to a
woman when that’s not provided in any other law or healthcare that I’m
aware of, and there’s no provision in this bill that the provider, where
that person works, has to ensure that there’s somebody there that will
provide this service, or that service will not be provided and an
alternative be provided in case of emergency? It is definitely, to me, a
clear there that the conscientious objection to abortion is considered
superior to the right of the woman coming for healthcare in that
situation.

  <p>That difference and do you think that&#39;s fair to woman seeking
healthcare?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma’am, our people believe that the fetus is a person
and to force another human being to take what they believe the life I
think would be a travesty to our entire idea of constitutional
government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow-up, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, do you yield follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any other area of the law that you’ll aware
of where we allow a person who because of their conscientious objection
not to provide service, a healthcare service to someone for a procedure
and health care that they have a constitutional right for that we&#39;ll
allow them not to provide that service or provide some alternative for
that care in case of that objection, that conscientious objection. Are
you aware of that in any other arena?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m not aware of anything in the law that requires
one person to take what they believe the life of another. No, ma&#39;am.
There are people that believe that would be wrong and be taking the life
of another person, and I do believe that is a cutout of this type of
situation that is understandable of people of faith that believe that
way and is something that we should work very hard to make sure we
don&#39;t force people to take those types of action when they
consciouslly object.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, For what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Goolsby, a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, we&#39;ve heard a lot about choice in
this debate today. Do you have any other, are you aware of any other
requirements in insurance policy where taxpayer funds would be required
for any other elective procedure, such as plastic surgery or elective
procedures people choose in their healthcare and are not mandated?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am not aware of any of those  types of elective
procedures mandated whether it&#39;s plastic surgery or something else
that you might want to choose on your own that not everyone chooses. No,
I&#39;m not aware of that, Senator Hise. That&#39;s a good point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant what approach do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a final follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, do you believe that a person&#39;s
conscientious objection or conscious objection or religious objection or
whatever it is to abortion supercedes a woman&#39;s constitutional right
to make that choice about her healthcare? Do you believe the objection
is superior to the constitutional right? Well, we hold these truths to
be self-evident that are men are required equal and die by their creator
with certain unalienable rights. Those being life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. And for a person who believes that life is supreme
and that a fetus is a person to ask them to act in a way that would take
that person&#39;s life, I would think to be wrong and would stand
against many hundreds of years of western jurisprudence and legal
theories and thoughts. I don&#39;t think that we should ever enforce a
uh by state law to have to perform an abortion procedure. There are
plenty of people that are willing to do that. Folks of consciousness
just like we have people that don&#39;t want to go to war and kill a
fellow man, because their belief is that&#39;s murder. There are people
likewise are the same way about abortion. And I don&#39;t think they
should be forced to commit that. And I just think that is a wrongful
thing to ask someone to do of conscience who believes another way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank you Mr. President. I&#39;d like to speak to
Second Town.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It is very clear to me that there are
people who are pursuing this schema here in this bill who believe their
objection of abortion is superior to a woman&#39;s constitutional right
to have that choice and that is unconstitutional which is the point
we&#39;re making. And these same people will be on this commission who
will be making these rules ?? that risk access. And yes this is about
fairness. It&#39;s about fairly addressing the balance between the
objection which I support as I strongly support a woman&#39;s right to
that choice. Both are equally valid and equally superior in the law and
in constitutional terms. And there are provisions of this bill that
violate that and that don&#39;t care for women who are seeking

  <p>To exercise that constitutional right, such as letting a janitor or a
receptionist because they object to abortion not do their job and sign
the person in or provide whatever service would need to be provided at
the health center where the woman shows up. That is not caring for women
and that is not being fair on this issue, and that is the point I&#39;m
making and to me that level of unfairness, even if you disagree with it
it ought to be clearly heard. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Graham, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion to concur. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman
of the Senate, here we are again discussing access. Last couple minutes
it was to the voting booth and now for women who have a constitutional
right to receive a medical procedure. That procedure is a private zone
to me. It should be for that woman and her family, her pastor, maybe a
close friend, but there&#39;s certainly no room for the GOP in that
circle. It&#39;s a private decision guaranteed by the constitution. ??
early in this chamber, and I don&#39;t mean to be negative every time I
stand up to speak, but it&#39;s been a cruel and unusual session for me
based on the many laws that were originated in this chamber that impact
the citizens of North Carolina and those I represent. And certainly this
bill is not different. It restricts access. It puts again artificial
barriers in place that really outlaws abortion in this state. The
standards that are in place in this bill reduces access. I think it
makes only one clinic in the state based on the new rules and
regulations and I think the new rules are, the rules that are currently
in place are working well as evident of closings in Charlotte and Durham
and Fayetteville. Existing rules. Why we are adding more is just yet
another example of national politics, national schemes, coming to North
Carolina. Voting, healthcare and a number of others I can quote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That starts across
the country. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will the Senator yield for a question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No, thank you, ma&#39;am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That starts across
the country and finds its way in Raliegh. So I am again just concerned
about my state and concerned about those individuals who find themselves
in a situation where they&#39;re contemplating this, and it&#39;s a
right that&#39;s protected by the constitution but their state
government once again is putting hurdles and barriers along the way. It
is not right. It is not fair, and it&#39;s disguised again in this
bills, I think it was freedom and what was the original bill name? It
was the 4th of July, Freedom, Faith and something on the 4th of July
week. Freedom? Faith? No. That&#39;s not what it is. It&#39;s just a
disguise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Hearing none,
the question before the, Senator Newton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll be brief and I will try to keep my remarks under control.

  <p>Senator Parmon and I had a few words of disagreement, I was certainly
embarrassed.   I don’t want to re-litigate that this is a passionate
subject that a lot of people feel very strongly about and we’ve heard a
lot of passionate words from the other side of the aisle, a lot of
questions, some of those questions started to get my dander up.
Senator Robinson I was tempted to pop up and ask you a question, you if
you have ever been present for a late term abortion.  I didn’t think
that was appropriate, that was inflammatory obviously you have never
been there for that great grotesque procedure, that wasn’t a good idea.
My discretion got a hold of me and I calmed down.
What is this bill really about?   What is this motion to concur about?
This bill we’ve debated for a couple of days earlier in this session; we
heard in committee, now it’s back before us, after all the hearings and
debates that have occurred in the  House.
This bill is about restricting abortion for sex selection, this bill
says you no longer can have an abortion if you want to choice the sex of
your child.  That is what this bill says, that’s how it’s restricting
your abortion, your right to choose.   You don’t get to choose what
gender you want your child to be and that child has to lose their life
because it’s the wrong one.  It says you don’t get to abort babies
because they are females but somehow the back row thinks that’s
attacking women.
Now we’ve heard a lot of lectures about Senator Nesbit, most especially
this session, about how us and the majority are not listening, that
we’re not listening to the people; that the people come down here and
protest and we’re not listening.
We’ll folks, except for a few extreme people who really think you should
do anything you want on abortion, because they don’t believe it’s a
life.  I don’t know many people that think that you should abort a child
because it’s the wrong sex, even pro-choice people that I know don’t
agree with that.
Because we are restricting we are restricting abortion in this way we
are going to send people off to coat hangers.  This bill says that
because so many people  in the state of North Carolina oppose tax payer
funding of abortions, that we are not going to allow tax payer dollars
to be used to subsidize insurance policies to pay for abortions except
for when the life of the mother, rape and incest.   Most people I know
think that’s appropriate, tax payers shouldn’t pay for abortions except
possibly in those situations, that’s what this bill does.
Senator Bryant my good friend, I’ve enjoyed debates with you and this
has been a healthy one, but I most point out, in my view, the absurdity
of the argument that you were making in regards to forcing healthcare
workers to perform abortions or participate in the performing of
abortions that they don’t agree with.
What you essentially said was that this right to an abortion that was
created by Rowe Vs Wade allows a woman to force someone who doesn’t
believe in abortion to participate in it.   I don’t know anybody that
thinks that’s a good idea, I am sure there’s some people that do and as
I pointed out in the last speech on this subject when we look at the
board we will see some folks that think that healthcare workers should
be made to participate in the performing of an abortion despite that
they believe that’s the killing of a child.  That’s wrong! I don’t know
how that restricts a woman’s right to have an abortion.  To tell my
child or my sister or somebody that I know in healthcare that doesn’t
believe in abortion that they have to participate in that is wrong,
that’s wrong!

  <p>I thought Senator Goolsby did an excellent job of reading the bill and
pointing out the lines to us that showed that the regulations that we’re
asking, the rules that we’re asking to be created, not unduly restrict
access to abortion. I thought that made an excellent point of saying, we
just want these clinics to be clean. We want them to be safe. We want
the health care workers who are willing to perform abortions to
understand what they’re doing so they don’t give a woman chemotherapy
drugs orally instead of injecting them because they don’t know what
they’re doing. That’s all we’re asking for in this bill. There’s no
clinic that’s going to be closed down over this. The back row has done
an excellent job of the talking points for the impending litigation that
they intend to file. All because we want these clinics to be safe and
don’t want North Carolina to be in the national media like  Philadelphia
was because that clinic was never inspected. I believe I’m correct in
saying these rules are going to be require these clinics to be inspected
at least once a year, if I remember correctly. This is a good bill. This
is common sense. Senator Nesbitt, these are the kinds of rules that the
vast majority of North Carolinians want us to have. If we’re going to
have abortion, we want it to be under the right circumstances. If we
have to have it. Last time I checked, very recently, the majority of
folks in this country, and I daresay in this state, are pro-Life anyway.
They don’t agree with abortion. And while they may not want to say that
nobody can ever have one under any circumstances, especially in the case
of rape and incest, they do want it to be rare. They don’t want to have
to pay for it. They don’t want to make people who don’t believe in it
participate in it. And God forbid, they don’t want people to have
abortions because of the gender of the child. I commend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion and debate. Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I am beginning to understand why you don’t like lawyers.
I apologize to you for derogatory statements I made to you when you
cussed them. This beats anything that I&#39;ve ever seen. All of a
sudden, anybody that opposes the point of view up there is somebody that
wants late term abortions and they want surreal ? That’s what we heard
the last time, and they want motorcycle helmets in this bill. You just
blame them for everything you stuck in this bill. You put it in there to
hide the real purpose of this bill. I don’t know how to tell you this,
but choice and a woman’s right to control her health belongs to the
women who want to exercise that right. You don’t go over and ask the
opinion of lawyers who are on the other side of the issue what they’re
entitled to. When I tell you you aren&#39;t listening, it’s not your
business to tell them what’s good for them and what’s bad for them. They
don’t want your opinion. They didn&#39;t ask for your opinion. They
don’t need your opinion. They know what you’re doing. They&#39;ve got it
figured out. It’s not hard to figure it out. Just track it through the
other states. This same things been done all over this country and
everywhere they’re shutting down clinics all over the United States. For
those of you who are so passionate about having these really high
quality places, put some money in the budget and build some. We’d love
that. In the meantime, how about letting women who have a place to
access

I am looking forward to that creative effort. Ok.
[Speaker Change]
He says voter fraud has been discovered and it has Pat McCrory standing
up with his hand up making a promise with his fingers crossed.  When he
was asked when he was campaigning, what would you sign? Will you sign
any further restrictions?  None. Now it doesn’t take a lawyer to
interpret that word.  That means none.  So when the bill comes out of
here, he says I am a man of my word.  I am not signing that. He meets
with crowd over across the hall for about ten minutes, makes a deal.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President?
[Speaker Change]
The next morning they roll out a bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Soucek , what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Point of order.
[Speaker Change]
State your point of order.
[Speaker Change]
I was speaking about another branch of government related to this bill.
[Speaker Change]
I am talking about this bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator
[Speaker Change]
Let’s go on. Keep going.
[Speaker Change]
Just tolerate me a moment and I will be done.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Nesbitt has been doing it 10 years.  I love you. Go ahead.
[Speaker Change]
Well they meet about ten minutes and they roll the bill out.  He says
now I fixed it and now I can sign it.  They didn’t change but a couple
of words in the thing.  Now he might think that all those women are
fooled.  They are not fooled.  They know what he did.  I am not here to
tell you, y’all can’t do this. You’ve got absolute power. You control it
all.  You can do anything you want to.  This goes both ways.  There is a
little old saying.  It says, I can tell you, but I can’t make you
understand.  We are trying to tell you and I can’t make you understand,
but I am going to promise you, what you are telling these women, whose
rights you are impinging on, they aren’t going to understand.  This is
just one more thing that you have done that’s going to drive people to
the polls to make a change in this state.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Berger for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. To speak on the motion.
[Speaker Change]
The Senator has the floor.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President.  Members of the Senate, we have had probably
more debate on this particular issue than I think anything else since I
have been in the General Assembly. We have had two full days before and
we have had if not a full day, certainly what for some folks seem like
an eternity for the last hour and 15 minutes…

  <p>So, I don’t know that anything I say will change anyone’s mind. I don’t
know that it’s appropriate for me to prolong this any longer and so I
ask you to vote in favor of the motion. I think the reasons for that
have been stated by a number of people, and ask that we move forward
with that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hearing no further discussion or debate,
the question before the Senate is concurrence with the House Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 353. All in favor will vote Aye. Any opposed
vote No. You will have five seconds to be allowed for the voting. The

of messages from the House and Governor, the ratification of bills, the
appointment of conferees and the receipt of conference reports. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I thought I heard Senator Bruntstetter say that but I must have
missed it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Mr. President just one more thing. I
just found out that House 938 which we just moved to rules will be the
third bill that you’ve been looking for, that we’re going to hear down
to rules. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Nesbitt, I see you stand.

all to give a big round of thanks to. If you notice, there’s a young
lady over here, a page, who has volunteered to stay here and work, and
she has worked here all day, all week, and her name is Jordan Keys, from
Raleigh. Senator Hunt’s page. Jordan. [APPLAUSE] Jordan, thank you so
much. And Senator Hunt’s getting very old, so one day he’ll need someone
to take his seat. So hurry up and get to 25, we’d love to have you back.
Thank you again. And come back and see us. Senator McKissick, you’re
walking kind of slow. Come on now. There you go. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer, for what purpose do you

Okay, alright we have two, we have lost two Senators, Senator Bingham
has an excuse to absence and Senator Brett’s wife gonna into labor and
he has at home so let’s think about that.
[Applause]
I just feel somebody, someone has to marry Senator Brett well that’s
another story. Alright, let’s get started, the conference report for
adoption Senate Bill 287.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 287: Notice Publication - Guilford Co. Local Govs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade explains the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, this is similar to basically what was passes
before but it only include two counties now Guilford and Mecklenburg and
it’s definitely a local bill. I ask you to vote for adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion and debate on the conference report. Hearing none the
question before the body is the adoption of the conference report for
the House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 287, all those in favor
will vote aye, all oppose vote no, five seconds be allow for the voting,
the clerk will record the vote. Clerk no, ___[01:40]aye,  ___[01:48]

Dominic went no, okay we are good, alright, 25 having voted in the favor
and 16 in the negative the conference report for Senate Bill 287 passes
and the house will be notified, the conference report, Senate Bill 317.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 317: Guilford and Stanley Election Systems.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade again to explain the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, what this basically does is lineup the school
board district with the county commission district that was put in place
in the last election cycle in the way it was before the redistrict in
last which would line the school board member with the County
Commissioner which would aid in making decisions based on schools and
what the Commissioner could do to help and they can work much better
together and I would ask for your support in adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would ask you to oppose it the Guilford County School Board vote by
resolution unanimously to oppose the change and we even heard the other
night from citizens, in Pleasant Garden citizens all across Guilford
County are asking us why do we want to make the school board partisan
when they feel that it works well as it is? So, I would ask for you to
oppose it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion and debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin what purpose you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate I agree with Senator
Robinson, I represent Stanley County in the General Assembly and their
County Commissioner’s I know Representative Berg has worked hard to come
up with a plan to change the number of County Commissioners and school
board members but the County Commissioners on a three to two vote asked
that we oppose and to leave the current size of their board of five
members and this would change their Board Of Commissioners to seven. So,
I would ask you to vote no on this, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Senator Wade what purpose you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, I will ask for your support on this for his adoption, this is
what the citizens certainly want and it’s not based on what the

  <p>Speaker1: …and I am sure I can speak for Representative Burr, I just
talked with him, and he would ask for your support also.
Mr. President: Further discussion or debate? Senator Ford, for what
purpose do you rise?
Speaker 2: Mr. President to see if the lady will yield for a question.
Mr. President: Senator will you yield?
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 2: Ma’am, can you share with us how you know what the citizens
want?
Speaker 1: Yes sir I can. I have been contacted by a lot of citizens.
When we passed this bill before, on redistricting, I went over that, but
I can go over it again. Basically, what happened was that I have
citizens call and talk to me about the school board, and that they can
never get another person elected. At first, I didn’t really… I thought,
well, you know, maybe they… the reason we don’t have any contested
elections, and in the general election there is not more than one that
there is a contest in – everybody else does not have any opposition. So
I took a look and in our rural counties, whoever runs for the large
position and wins, never really picks up any of the rural counties –
they always vote for an opponent, if there is one. So basically their
views, in the rural area, don’t ever seem to be represented because they
can’t beat out the urban areas because there are more people voting
their. They are absolutely right: there isn’t any chance of them getting
someone that represents their views.
Mr. President: Any follow up Senator Wade? Follow up? She yields.
Speaker 2: Madam do you have any formal or any organization help in
determining the number of citizens, or is this your own anecdotal
evidence you are using to justify this bill?
Speaker 1: Senator, all I can tell you is that since this bill has been
out there I have had the most opposition from our newspaper, and the
next is from the school board, and after that, I have had maybe ten
emails where three were for it and seven were against it out of our
whole county - out of 500,000 people.
Mr. President: For what purpose do you rise?
Speaker 3: To ask Senator Ford a question.
Mr. President: Senator Ford, you have a question.
Speaker 4: For the gentleman, any time.
Speaker 3: This is a local bill, what district do you represent?
Speaker 4: Sir, I represent District 38.
Speaker 3: That’s nowhere near Gilford County, is it?
Speaker 4: Actually it’s in McClemburgh.
Speaker 3: That’s what I thought. Okay.
Mr. President: Any further discussion or debate? Senator Raven , for
what purpose do you rise?
Speaker 5: To ask the sponsor a question.
Mr. President: Senator Wade, do you yield?
Sponsor: Sir, I do.
Speaker 5: When we listened all day today to all the other
conversations, did you think of challenging where people’s data came
from?
Sponsor: No sir I didn’t.
Speaker 5: That’s what I thought. I agree with you and what you are
saying, and support the bill, and ask everyone else to. Thank you.
Mr. President: Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
Speaker 6: To ask Senator Wade a question or two.
Mr. President: Senator Wade, do you yield?
Senator Wade: I do.
Speaker 6:  Senator Wade, you mentioned rural counties: is Pleasant
Garden a rural town?
Senator Wade: The precincts in that area, yes ma’am they are.
Speaker 6: Follow up Mr. Chair?
Mr. President: Follow up Senator Wade?
Speaker 6: Senator Wade, you and I went to, in fact, we were the only
two out of our delegation, at a townhall meeting in Pleasant Garden, a
couple of weeks or so ago, Would you share what the citizens… was that a
question from them, or was there some opposition that night?
Senator Wade: Yes I believe there was some and after discussion that
night, and when I was leaving that night, several came up to me saying
they understood. We talked to maybe fifteen or twenty citizens out of
the whole county at that meeting.
Speaker 6: Okay. No other questions Senator Wade – but a second time to
talk on that bill?
Mr. President: Senator has the floor. Go ahead.
Speaker 6: [laughing] I am kind of weary too. I do want to say Pleasant
Garden, where I live, is very rural. It does have some rural
representation and at our townhall meeting the other night, without
invitation, the citizens did ask the question and did complain. That
complaint came from those citizens in that room, and I think there were
about fifty in that room. They did say – we are working together in
Gilford county; we are rural; we do not understand why this is
necessary. So the citizens are not supporting this. We knew the citizens
of Greensborough were not in favor, but we did hear from those in the
county as well.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have three calendar motions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, state your motions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, Senate Bill 127 is on the supplemental calendar, Economic
Development Modifications. I move it be removed from the supplemental
calendar and re-referred to the Committee on Rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 652, Modified Judicial Disciplines, in the Committee on
Rules. I move that it be removed from the Committee on Rules and brought
to the floor and placed on the calendar after Senate Bill 571.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Joint Resolution 1023, Adjournment Resolution, is on the calendar.
I ask that it be placed at the end of this calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I may have to object to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection so ordered. Senator Hartsell has an excused absence.
House Bill 938.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 938. Clarify Wetlands Permitting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, we&#39;ve seen this
bill before, but it was in the Farm Act, and we got it passed out of the
Senate 48 to nothing, and then it was passed out of the House Ag
Committee unanimous, and then when I got it to the House Judiciary B,
they took out the language that is here, and this is concerning the
wetlands and the isolated wetlands. Now, this does not alter the purpose
or the requirements of the federal wetland program, and while this
language will not repeal the Isolated Wetland Rule, it will clarify that
DENR may not require permits for activities in wetlands that are not
waters of the U.S. and therefore not covered by the Clean Water Act.
This language will not affect the current requirements for Section 404
permit issued by Corps of Engineers, or Section 401 certification issued
by DENR. This language simply fits the clarification found in the
EMC&#39;s rules, in the statute, wetlands classified as waters are
restricted to waters of the United States. And this language also states
that no permit shall be required for activities in wetlands that are not
waters of the United States. And I would appreciate your support and be
happy to answer any questions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion and debate? Senator Hunt, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What&#39;s the distinction of waters of the United States? The water of
the United States is the water of the United States, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Waters of the United States is actually contiguous waters, from what I
understand, like rivers and streams. But it is not isolated, which means
that they&#39;re not connected. Like you might have a half acre here
that is not connected to a half acre, you know, 150 yards away.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So a pond here and a pond there, not connected, they are not waters of
the United States?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Jackson will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Did you say that this is the current regulation of the
Environmental Management Commission or of DENR? I couldn&#39;t remember
what you said. Does this definition exist somewhere else in state law
and you&#39;re moving it into statute?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This exists in the federal state laws. It doesn&#39;t exist in our
current state laws, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do is make a
mirror there. Basically, yes that&#39;s the answer to your question. I
was going to try and get back to Senator Hunt&#39;s question. I found
the definition of waters of the U.S., but go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Senator Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we didn&#39;t put this in there, into the statutes, and you were

  <p>Senator: … a wetland that was not waters of the United States, what
would you be required to do now that we are…., since we are taking the
definition out, we know that you won’t be required to do that.
Senator: To respond Mr. President, we are not actually taking the
definition out. What we are saying is that donor does not have to issue
a permit for these isolated wetlands, i.e. if you have say a half acre,
or 1/3 acre or a tenth of an acre, or even a milhold per se, and it is
not connected to another half acre, or 1/3 acre or a tenth of an acre,
or milhold per se, they are not actually wetlands of the U.S. and the
federal government does not actually regulate them so we are asking that
the donor does not require a permit for them as well.
Senator: I think it is becoming clear now – no further questions.
Speaker: Senator, for follow up?
Senator: Yes sir, what you are saying is that today, under current law,
donor does issue permits and that does make it…
Senator: That is correct.
Senator: I lied – one more follow up.
Senator: One more time Senator Jackson.
Senator: Has Deener made this request?
Senator: No they have not.
Speaker: Senator Mayer for what purpose do you rise?
Senator: To debate the bill.
Speaker: Senator has the floor to debate the bill.
Senator: I have heard from people who are knowledgeable that this is not
something we want to be changing in our policy. Many wetlands that
appear to be isolate from surface waters are actually vital components
of regional water systems since they reach local and [xx]. In addition,
many of the functions are performed by so called isolate wetlands
because they have no so called surface outflow, isolated wetlands serve
as protection against flooding as well as drought. They are very
necessary for water purification. [Excuse me, I am trying to get this
machine to work, which it is not doing.] It is very important for water
purification, for wildlife habitat, and actually, the permitting has no
effects whatsoever on agricultural activities, and I urge you to vote
against this.
Speaker: Senator, for what purpose do you rise?
Senator: Will the bill’s sponsor yield for a question?
Speaker: Senator Jackson yields.
Senator: Thank you Mr. President. You said you found the definition of
waters of the U.S. would you kindly share that with us please?
Senator: Water means any stream, river, brook, lake, swamp, bay, creek,
reservoir, waterway, or other body, or accumulation of water whether on
the surface or underground, public or private, natural or artificial,
that is contained in or flows through or borders any portion of this
state, including any portion of the Atlantic Ocean, over which the state
has jurisdiction. Wetlands classified as water are restricted to waters
of the U.S.
Speaker: Follow up?
Senator: Follow up, yes. If there are two… I heard lake in there. Does
this apply to lakes? Where are we with lakes?
Senator: It is my understanding, Senator Barringer, that it has to…they
have to be connected: if there is a water that runs into a lake – that
is considered waters of the U.S.; but if it is an isolated body of
water, whether it be a mudhole, or whether it be a couple of acres, that
is not connected to another body of water, that is an isolated wetland.
Senator: Thank you Mr. President.
Speaker: Senator for what purpose do you rise?
Senator: To speak a second time on the bill.
Speaker: Senator has the floor.
Senator: I would like to point out that NC state law defines waters of
the state protected from pollution and unmitigated destruction to
include wetlands – means any swamp or other body or accumulation of
water, whether it be surface or underground, that is contained in or
flows through any portion of this state. This has been upheld by both
the NC Court of Appeals and the NC Supreme Court that these are wetlands
of the state and should be protected.
Speaker: Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
Senator: Just need to clarify to speak to the bill tonight.
Speaker: Senator has the floor.
Senator: Just want to clarify that this will not repeal the isolated
wetland rule.

wetlands that are not part of the US and are therefore not covered by
the clean water act.  This is a good common sense bill, and I appreciate
your support.
[Speaker Changes] Any further discussion or debate? Senator Woodard what
purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Question for the bills sponsor
[Speaker Changes] Senator Jackson, he yields
[Speaker Changes] Thank you
[Speaker Changes] You&#39;re welcome
[Speaker Changes] Thank you for yielding Senator Jackson
[Speaker Changes] Could you just again clarify for me Deaner&#39;s
position on this bill?
[Speaker Changes] Deaner is not in favor of this bill.  They would be in
favor of some type of agreement to work it out, but we have not come to
that yet, so we decided to go ahead to run this bill while we are in
this section.
[Speaker Changes] And then Deaner&#39;s reaction is just going to be
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] I&#39;m sorry. So they&#39;ll just implement it, or
they&#39;ll just work it out later
[Speaker Changes] Well I assume they&#39;ll implement it  If we make it
state law, I hope they will
[Speaker Changes] Well I understand that, Alright thank you, I&#39;ve
got my answer
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick, what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Can I ask Senator Jackson a question?
[Speaker Changes] He yields
[Speaker Changes] Senator Jackson, what is the permitting process
consist of today for these questionable areas which is apparently some
ambiguity even though it seems to me it&#39;s pretty clear what these
wetlands consist of.  What are they due today?  What is the process?
What is the procedure? What does one have to go through?  I&#39;m
familiar with wetland permits in coastal areas, I&#39;m not as familiar
with wetland permits in non coastal areas, kind of inland areas, what is
this today, in terms of what Deaner is doing?
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick I cannot answer that question.  I do
not know what the process is to get a permit is to get a permit for
this.
[Speaker Changes] Follow-up Mr. President
[Speaker Changes] He takes a follow-up, go ahead
[Speaker Changes] ???
[Speaker Changes] Sentaor Jackson, in light of the fact that Deaner is
not supportive of this measure, you&#39;re not clear what the permitting
procedures are, would it not be in our best interest to hold this over
to the short session to deal with it at that time, as opposed to perhaps
to taking a vote on it tonight when we, there seems to be quite a bit of
ambiguity that perhaps could be resolved with further study and
evaluation.
[Speaker Change] Senator McKissick that would be your opinion but that
would not be my opinion. My opinion would be that we have spoken with
Deaner on this several times and we have not have any language from them
that would represent what we&#39;re trying to accomplish here so I would
recommend we pass this bill and then work it out.
[Speaker Change] Quick follow-up Mr. President
[Speaker Change] Follow-up
[Speaker Change] No Sir
[Speaker Change] Senator Gunn, what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change] Once again, let me tell that the rule exceeds the
federal guidelines, if you remember, we have the past regulatory form,
trying to bring our rules consistent with the federal guidelines, this
is a good common sense rule, it protects our water, we still have the
clean water act, we need to support this, Thank you.
[Speaker Change] Mr. President
[Speaker Change] Senator Kinnaird, what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change] To ask Senator Jackson a question
[Speaker Change] Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[Speaker Change] Yes, sir, I can&#39;t turn down Senator Kinnaird
[Speaker Change] Did I hear you say Deaner is opposed to this bill?
[Speaker Change] Their opposed to the way it&#39;s written, yes
ma&#39;am, I&#39;m not going to tell you a story.
[Speaker Change] 2nd Question
[Speaker Change] Follow up, Senator Jackson
[Speaker Change] Yes, Sir
[Speaker Change] Is the secretary of Deaner a Republican?
[Speaker Change] He is
[Speaker Change] 3rd Question
[Speaker Change] Follow up again Senator Jackson
[Speaker Change] Is the assistant security, who is a former house
member, who said at one point, he said he had Deaner marked a bulls-eye
marked on his, is he also a Republican?
[Speaker Change] Senator Kinnaird, I really misspoke, when I said
Secretary Skivaro was a republican because I haven&#39;t looked up the
registrations of either one of them, but I assume he is.
[Speaker Change] Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change] Ask the bill sponsor a s question, please
[Speaker Change] Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[Speaker Change] Yes sir
[Speaker Change] Everybody knows I&#39;m new here, and I&#39;m looking
to senior members for guidance, am I mistaken when I say that we
legislate and that Deaner, and it&#39;s just sorta the way it goes?
[Speaker Change] That&#39;s my understanding

Senator Brunstetter, for the rules and operation of the Senate

number one, unfavorable as to bill, but favorable as to committee.
Substitute bill as amended, entitled an act to make technical,
clarifying, and other modifications to the current operations and
capital improvements appropriations act of 2013 and to related
legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter, what purpose do you rise?

Mr. President, the bill just read in, can we go ahead and place it on

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 571 authorize various special plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise is recognized to explain the report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate.  As I will begin to
say that I&#39;m a stand in for Senator Brock on this conference report,
moving in due to his absence to leave.  What this conference report
does, after we brought it over from the House, is we have added to the
free plates, which include free registration and fees, three special
plate authorizations.  The bronze star medal for valor recipients and
the recipients of the silver star awards.  I will say that Senator Rabin
will be able to address those questions much better than I can in moving
in this area.  For the important parts, we have added 200 individuals
signing up for the plates as additional requirements to have what are
considered the full color plates within this state.  And we have
required the non-full color plates the name of the state as well as
others are of a high contrast and reflective with the background, so
they can be read easily.  Most importantly, I will say, for the 50
thousand individuals in the state of North Carolina that have the Blue
Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains plate, this preserved those
plates moving forward and the 100 thousand of them that live in my
district, so I&#39;d appreciate y&#39;all&#39;s support on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, I think you heard that last statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.  Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to debate this conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, there are a lot of
great things we&#39;ve accomplished in the last few years that we&#39;ve
been here, and one of the main reasons is because we always did them for
the right reasons.

  <p>I hate to stand up and tell you, but I’m embarrassed about this
particular Bill. First time I&#39;ve been embarrassed by anything we’ve
been involved with in this Senate, in this general assembly. Some of you
were here the last session. We actually found a way to solve a problem
that started many years back and if Senator Clodfelter were here or
Senator Jenkins, Senator Hoyle. A problem that occurred a number of
years back that they regretted, but never could find the strength to
solve was to get rid of these full colored plates. They’ve expanded.
They’ve become up to a number of forty. Now your going to say, “Well,
isn’t it nice how North Carolina&#39;s got forty plates plus a basic
first and flight plate?” The problem we&#39;ve got here and what we had
at the time when we finally found a solution to this and phased-out
these full colored plates was a phase-out that we could finally get an
agreement on. Actually, it was the last Bill we passed the last session,
and we had it solved. Senator Rabin and I and Senator Harrington worked
very hard to get this problem resolved and many people on both sides of
the isle were supportive of it. Unfortunately, we sent a good Bill over
to the House. They overturned, or actually changed the way these
phase-outs of the multi colored plates were supposed to be. And, in
essence, what happened is we lost the opportunity, if this Bill passes,
to phase-out these plates. People will say, “Well, why do you want to do
that?” Well, first of all ladies and gentlemen, the law enforcement
officers of this state at that time and even today said that they’re
just very challenging to read. A couple of the biggest culprits are the
Smoky Mountain plate and the Blue Ridge Parkway plate. The officers told
us and Senator Rabin and Senator Harrington will say when we discussed
with them, well what would you do? Their answer was this was a
compromise plate with one stipulation that you should be able to read
it. And, I showed them the plate and they said, &quot;Well, there&#39;s
a concern. We can&#39;t read it well in the daytime and you can&#39;t
even begin to read it at night.&quot; What that means ladies and
gentlemen is it is a safety issue for the law enforcement people that
are in the field, across the state, that think that we have, that they
hope that we have their backs. And unfortunately, we&#39;re letting them
out on this one. We&#39;re not giving them what they need. And what
we&#39;re doing with this Bill, is supporting the fat cat drivers who
like to have these forty colored plates decorating their automobiles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have about thirty more seconds. You&#39;ll be...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh no, that&#39;s not true. I want as much time as you
gave Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt&#39;s going to have all the time he
needs. You go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[LAUGHING]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And in this situation, those forty colored plates are
a real safety hazard for the law enforcement officers. I know a number
of members of this Senate body have come to me and talked and they said,
&quot;Well, you know those colored plates? They&#39;re a real problem
for another reason and that is because of the fact that criminals like
to hide behind those colored plates cause nobody, either criminal or
drug dealers, cause nobody can identify where they&#39;re state
is.&quot; I&#39;d hate to be a law enforcement officer on a dark road,
coming up and not know what I&#39;m walking into, where I didn&#39;t
even know that was a North Carolina plate. Could be Oregon, could be
Utah, could be Pennsylvania, but it surely couldn&#39;t tell it was
North Carolina. We&#39;ve got a tough decision on this vote ladies and
gentlemen. We can one, vote for the money and for the glamour license
plate crowd, or you can vote on behalf of the law enforcement officers
who are out there everyday, protecting our families and other people in
this state. And this is what it breaks down to. Two choices. The glamour
license plate crowd or the officers of this state. And they&#39;re
counting on you, every one of you, to vote on their behalf. I urge you
to support, because I&#39;m supporting them. That&#39;s what my vote is
going to matter. I hope each of you recognize the importance of this.
There are other parts of this Bill I am very pleased with, but this
actually destroys what was a good solution to a bad problem that...

  <p>It started a number of years back and no one was able to fix except we
were able to fix it. Now, because of the house action and because of the
Senate going along with that. We are going and voting against law
enforcement officers in this state. I hope you recognize that I hope no
officer get hurt or killed because of this action. I urge you to vote
against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? ?? please rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What Senator Highfield ?? ?? Senator  the compromise
end up playing the plate that was developed in consultation in highway
patrol and others that has the block with the contrasting letter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??, as I understand it, that is current law that
is outside this compromise that all those plates have moved to the white
block now that makes the letters clearly visible. It is consistent as
well with the study done in 2012 by the DMV as well as DPS that
determined that these plates would meet their regulation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? ?? one more question ?? and just to make it clear
this bill does that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s correct. It goes to the plates that are
available for individuals now under the current law does at sunset.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. ??. Speak on the bill, you have the
floor. Mr. ??, members of the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The problem here I think is the ability to adjust to a
better idea. It&#39;s not that we&#39;re going back to the old idea,
it&#39;s that we&#39;re going to a better idea. I&#39;ve seen these
plates, I didn&#39;t know this bill was going to be on here tonight or I
would have brought them in here so you can look at them from where
you&#39;re sitting. With this white block and the contrasting letters
you can see them better than the one that&#39;s got the bursting flight
and the wheat and everything else on it. They&#39;re much better
contrast. It requires North Carolina to be in a better contrast,
possibly even bigger. When I look at it I see North Carolina and I see
the number. The vanity of it&#39;s part of it&#39;s over in about at
third of the-it&#39;s over in about a third of the side of the license
block and there&#39;s none of it over there on the white. Now, what
everybody wanted to do was to go to the first in flight with the oats
and everything all over the license plate. Which, to some degree, clouds
a little bit your ability to read the plate or can and a very good
solution was found of  this. You&#39;ve got people that, it&#39;s not
just those people up in the mountains and it&#39;s not a bunch of fat
cats, it&#39;s people that care about the Smoky Mountains National Park,
you know they&#39;ve been short of money. They helped raise money for
the park to supplement it. The Blue Ridge Parkway which is one of our
gems of an asset up there. They&#39;ve been underfunded and they need
help. These people raise money for those icons, if you will, that we
have up there. In the vanity plates, lots of people participate in them
in different ways and maybe we can just say, &quot;Well we just
won&#39;t have any and we&#39;ll go back to something.&quot; I&#39;ll
tell you about what they did three or four years ago and I about had a
stroke. They put red letters on our plates. You know the letters are
blue. All of a sudden I started seeing these red letters. I said,
&quot;Where&#39;d those come from?&quot;. &quot;Oh well, they
decided&quot;. &quot;Who decided?&quot;. These look very much like North
Carolina. Those blue tags look very much like North Carolina.
They&#39;re safe. They were put together. The law itself, if you&#39;ll
read your bill, provided that the division shall develop consultation
with highway patrol, Division of Adult Corrections, a standardized
format for these plates. That&#39;s what they did. Law enforcement has
signed off on this and said that they&#39;re happy with it. There&#39;s
absolutely no reason in the world to just abuse this group of people and
say, &quot;Well, no we&#39;re not going to listen to reason down here
and not let you do what you want to do in this world when there
isn&#39;t hurting anybody.&quot; And I urge you to vote for this thing
to put an end to this
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ?? ?? What purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? ?? to yield for questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? ?? do you yield to questions?

  <p>Yes sir, I&#39;ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Since your somewhat of an historian here in the House
and the Senate, and I&#39;ve heard you speak a lot today, would you
consider this bill to be a license plate suppression?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I&#39;ll let you have that phrase, You need one today.
I&#39;ve been quoted enough.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Anybody else out there?  Senator Rucho, what purpose do
you arrive?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator, I would like to speak a second time if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Shorty, shorty Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Of course, sir.  I&#39;ve got to clarify a point,
because when Senator Raven, Senator Harrington and I spoke, Senator
Nesbitt said a very important point.  This was a compromised plate, and
when we discussed this with the highway patrol, Senator Harrington
asked, Well we don&#39;t want you to have to compromise, what do you
think should be the right way to go?  And then, we showed them this
picture that you talk about, and all of that grey, is all the color, the
full color of that.  That one little white block where the numbers are,
yes that makes it visible.  But the North Carolina, isn&#39;t and the
rest of it is very challenging.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Rucho, we can&#39;t hear you, you&#39;ve got
your mike down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I&#39;m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]There you go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I&#39;m trying to speak loud, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I know.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You can&#39;t see North Carolina, you can&#39;t
determine Spencer.  When someone is riding down the road at 60 miles an
hour, or 65 miles an hour, or 75 miles an hour, Senator Nesbitt. But
under these circumstances ladies and gentlemen, this plate, the way
it&#39;s called a full colored plate with 40 different colors is a
safety hazard to law enforcement officers.  And bottom line to this,
it&#39;s either you vote for the glamor license plate crowd, or for you
law enforcement officers.  That&#39;s your choice, and I urge you to
vote for the law enforcement officers and against this conference
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Hearing no further debate, the question before the
Senate is the adoption of the conference report to Senate Bill 571.  All
in favor as recommended will vote aye, and the opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sir, Mr. President, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I have to send forth a excused absence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I mean an excused from voting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I&#39;ll just bring it, it&#39;s faster.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That&#39;s fine, thank you. You are excused. Okay, all
in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no.  We&#39;ll have 5 seconds for
the vote.  The clerk will tabulate the totals. Mr. Burger Aye, Newton
Aye, Brunstetter Aye, Wade Aye, Wade Aye, oh, Wade no, I&#39;m sorry.
Sanderson, he&#39;s a no also. Wade got to him.  Okay, 30 in the
affirmative, 11 in the negative.  The conference report for Senate Bill
571, does pass and the House will be notified.  Senator Rucho,
you&#39;re mikes off.  Sir Brunstetter, are you ready to go?  Okay.
While Senator Brunstetter telling a clerk, I&#39;ll take a moment of
personal privilege and let anyone know I look forward to buying Senator
Rucho a steak at Ruth&#39;s Chris.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I have the floor sir, please sit down. Because he did
lose his bet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I just wanted to remind you that you lost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, no I won.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Nesbitt and I will go.  You don&#39;t have to.
Okay,  Senator Brunstetter are your ready?  What? House or Senate?
House Bill 652?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]House 652.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]652.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]House Bill 652, modified judicial districts plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Goolsby&#39;s recognized.  Explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President.  This bill places the public
reprimand for our judges within the power of the Supreme Court, not the
judicial standards committee.  The judicial standards cannot recommend a
public reprimand under this bill for a judge or justice unless the judge
or justice has been afforded a hearing with due process of law.  Our
records investigations recommendations and hearings by judicial
standards in the Supreme Court will have made confidential under this
bill, until the Supreme Court issues a public reprimand, censure,
suspension, or removal.  It also appeals general statute 7A378,
regarding censured, suspension and removal of any justice.  I&#39;ll be
happy to answer any questions.

CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill had a short life last week, because many of
us realized that we were keeping information about the judges, who have
an effect on anybody who comes through the court system, and keeps from
the public any information about reprimands. I will remind us that it
had a short life, it had someone who came in and saved it at the last
minute, but I want to remind people how we voted last time, that we did
not think that this was something that we wanted to change in our

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 112. Modification 2013 Appropriations Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister President. Members, this is the budget technical
corrections bill. We have done our best to keep this as technical as
possible. Probably the most material policy change is in here will be,
is located in section 6.2 of the bill, towards the back. It transfers a
number of Department of Justice positions, mainly attorneys and
paralegals, into the agencies in which they serve. It&#39;s, my
recollection about nineteen positions or so, some paralegals, some
lawyers. And a number of these positions are currently vacant, but it
will allow the attorneys to more closely serve the agencies which
they&#39;ve been operating with. The attorney general has agreed to this
arrangement. Also, I believe that Senator Blue had raised some concerns
about the low wealth school funding formula. These changes have been
made in sections 3.19, 3.20. We have staff here and subcommittee chairs
if there are any questions. I ask for  your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue has an excused absence. Further debate.

Well, then I don&#39;t yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And it may be for staff, but this is just on page twenty seven, it&#39;s
something that I&#39;m just not familiar with. It indicates that perhaps
because of the tax reform changes or something and telephone, and some
kind of tax for telecoms that a low income residential rate will be
eliminated by the Utility Commission or something. Is there somebody
that could explain what will happen as a result of this change?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, I&#39;m going to send staff over to explain this one to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions while staff&#39;s explaining? All right, we&#39;ll
recess, we&#39;ll stand at ease a moment. Senator Bryant, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted, based on the information I received from staff, just to,
for the record and to let the members know that because of the change in
the tax credit that the telecoms have, which was funding a lifeline, low
income, the estate portion, which was three dollars and fifty cents per
eligible person, I&#39;m gathering.

  <p>Speaker 1: ...funding at a reduced rate for low income customers in a
certain category that now will be eliminated by that and they will still
