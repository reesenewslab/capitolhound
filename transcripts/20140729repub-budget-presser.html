Okay. Thank, thank ya'll for being here. The Speaker and I and, and our
members are proud to, to come before you today and announce that not
only do we have a framework agreement as far as the budget is concerned,
we have the details pretty much worked out, haven't printed the package
up yet, which hopefully that'll be done later today and we'll be
released sometime tonight, or tomorrow, probably tomorrow before it gets
released. But just a few comments and the Speaker will make a few
comments, then we'll be more than happy to take your questions. A little
more than three years ago, Republicans assumed leadership of the general
assembly and began the process of adopting policies that, first of all,
addressed what we had at that time, a two and a half billion dollar
budget deficit. We've worked tirelessly since that time to put the state
back on solid financial footing by closing that budget deficit, reining
in spending, and giving North Carolina families and businesses the
largest tax cut in state history. As a result, today, more North
Carolineans are going to work then ever before in three and a half
years. Since Republicans were elected to the majority, over two hundred
and twenty thousand new jobs have been created in the state of North
Carolina, and the unemployment rate has fallen by over four percentage
points. Responsible budgeting decisions and pro-growth economic policies
have also enabled legislative Republicans to offer, at this time, the
largest teacher pay increase in state history as part as adjustments to
the 2014-2015 state budget. This budget adjustment will also provide
public school educator, will provide public school educators an average
seven percent pay raise, averaging three thousand five hundred dollars
per teacher. The two hundred and eighty two million dollars invested in
teacher pay with, with this budget will be the largest teacher pay
increase in state history, moving North Carolina from forty sixth in the
nation to thirty second in the nation in national teacher pay rankings.
Investing two hundred and eighty two million dollars in pay raises will
make North Carolina more competitive nationally and encourage the best
and brightest of our teachers to make long term commitments to the state
and to our students. The budget will also preserve teacher assistant
positions, protect classroom funding and continue to give
superintendents broad flexibility to tailor classroom spending to their
district's needs. In addition to the teacher pay raise and preservation
of classroom funds, the budget agreement will do a number of things and
I'll just go through a list of a few. We'll reform and replace the
archaic thirty seven step teacher pay system with a six step schedule
and a transparent compensation package. We'll preserve current Medicaid
eligibility, provide most state employees with a one thousand dollar pay
raise and five bonus vacation days. We will increase pay for STEP
eligible highway patrol troopers between five and six percent. We'll
maintain funding at current levels for the state's university system.
We'll fulfill the commitment we've made to extend supplemental pay for
teachers with Masters degrees who have completed at least one course in
their master level work by August 1st, 2013. The budget will also boost
early career teacher pay by fourteen percent over the next two years to
thirty five thousand dollars making North Carolina a leader in the
Southeast and fulfilling a promise that the Governor, the Speaker, and
I, and both houses of the legislature made to the people and to the
teachers in this state back in February. And I'll turn it over to
Speaker Tillis now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Berger. Again, I want to thank all of the, my
colleagues in the House and Senate in the room today and the dozens
others who have been involved in this negotiation process. I want to
personally thank Senator Berger for working side by side on resolving
the differences between us. As is always the case, we have our
differences. We have advocate for them vigorously and then we come
together as we are today. The only, I think the thing I'd like to build
on is how we got here because I think that it's critically important for
everyone to understand the way that we got to the point that we are
today is because of the difficult decisions we had to make in 2011 to
get the fiscal house in order. But now we're in a position to provide
these historic pay increases, to provide pay increases to state
employees and teachers, to fulfill the promise we made to the educators
back in February, and I should also say that that includes the second
stage of that, that promise, for starting teachers. That's the pay raise
that they'll get next year to take us from regional competitiveness and
this budget and then up to above the national average in the next
budget, next year. The</p>

is in the budget.  It's funded to the tune of $10 million in the budget,
but we're converting the credit program to a grant program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I wonder ?? question Representative Berger can you
chance answer this?  Do you anticipate a final vote on this by Friday or
what is your timeline if that's not the timeline?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think we're working on a timeline for a vote on
Friday or Saturday after the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We may be able to vote it as early as Thursday.  Our
rules are a little bit different than the house's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  As a matter of process where the staff need probably
about 24 hours to get the document reviewed and then re-reviewed with
the members and then the house rules require that it be published for a
period of 24 hours before we take up a vote.  So at that point it would
put us earliest date would be Friday or Saturday.  I'm sorry I said 48,
I meant to say 48.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Is there, for the teacher raises was that recurring
dollars we're using or nonrecurring?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, if you take a look at the total teacher
assistance allocation there was about $64, $65 million dollars currently
being used for teachers.  So we're accounting for it as a part of the
teacher pay, but it can move back into the teacher system allotment
based on what the school district want to do.  All of that money is
recurring.  There's about $24 million, a little over $24 million,
dollars in the TA allotment that is being used for purposes other than
paying teachers or teacher assistants.  We've made that one small
segment nonrecurring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does any of that money come from the lottery?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'll let you know the lottery when it was adopted
several years ago funds a good bit of education and so some of the TA
allotment is being funded by the lottery.  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  But it's not, some of the discussion we had about
possibly changing advertisements and driving new revenue, that was not
included.  This was based on current capacity of the lottery.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Quick clarification, $1,000 pay raise, is that $1,000
plus benefits or is that $1,000?  You're nodding your head.  Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think afterwards about $1200 after adding all the
benefits in $1239 after you fully burden it for benefits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  ?? is step increases regarding raises.  Are those
there too?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Say that again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Step increases. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We mentioned the step increases for the state
troopers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think Magistrates and Clerks had step increases as
well, but otherwise state employees get the net $1,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think the other thing is also we're unfreezing the
step plan.  So now that as we move through and we have teachers retire
we think that we have the step plan will allow us to find movement
through the steps just through the normal cycling of folks retiring and
people coming on board.  We think we've got a sound sustainable step
plan to build on next year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're missing the masters pay for teachers. This will
cover a pay frame when who has already started the program.  What about
knowing it forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What we intend to do is once we have passed this
budget which reforms the teacher pay plan and creates a solid platform
we will then in future sessions have the opportunity to look at how we
deal with incentive pay or bonus pay or additional pay for masters.
What we've basically done is we've grandfathered in all of the folks who
previously were eligible for master pay.  We've also provided that
anyone who has started a master program and taken at least one class and
completed that class by August of last year is eligible for the master,
I think it's the 10% bonus.  We've done nothing beyond that to further
expand the program.  I think that's something we'll be working on as we
go forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Why cut that as part of these negotiations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We've not cut it, we've actually expanded it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  There was talk of extending it to anyone who got a
degree on their own field going forward.  That didn't make it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It didn't make it, but I would disagree that's a cut.
 It's just not an expansion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think you all could do that in the context of the
significant average raise that were given to the population.  So we felt
like right now we needed to get a fair and equitable raise in place for
the baseline.  That will be a part of the discussion next year.
There's generally an openness to anything that is encouraging
increasetrials incompetencies in areas that we think are most important,
like the stem subjects.

There's a million to fill the medical examiner system and the governor
asked for 2 million dollars.
[Speaker Changes]
I thought the governor's proposal had a million dollars and we matched
what he had in his budget.
[Speaker Changes]
You later called for 2 million dollars
[Speaker Changes]
We accepted the formal proposal
[Speaker Changes]
Does this budget cut any school nurse's positions or funding for the ??
school
[Speaker Changes]
Both of you spoke earlier this session about supporting more money for
vouchers is that in the budget?
[Speaker changes]
There is an appropriation of approximately 800000 dollars that would
potentially be available for children that exceed at the maximum amount
which is 2500 for base funding which could provide for the second
academic year some additional funding for those slots.
[speaker changes]
You mention in here that the average 3500 dollar per teacher raise does
that correspond to 7% or what kind of percent does that correspond to
and how do you structure that i know in that senate proposal early on it
was weighted towards the early career of people and how do you structure
this?
[speaker changes]
We'll have available for you the paid plan itself and those averages
have been worked out by folks that do the math I have not done the math
my self but 7% is the number they are telling us is what we have and the
average is 3500 dollars. Basically we go from the 37 step plan that
currently exists to a 6 step plan wit the beginning pay at 33000, 3300 a
month and at 25 years were at 50000 dollars and there is six steps on
the way over the 25 years. We will be able to get you the details.
[speaker changes]
That six step plan also lays the ground work for some good ideas coming
out of the governor's recommendation along the program he had called
career pathways were working on language and funding in order to get the
going and encourage some of the local DLAA's to come back with
recommendation on how we can get that program going as well.
[speaker changes]
We think that by setting the base and having the six step plan and
setting it up so that over time that plan is funded on a recurring basis
with pretty much flat dollars. It doesn't cost anymore year over year to
keep that going based on what fiscal folks are telling us that we then
have a platform to build on to do things such as the ?? supplements such
as paying the teacher's additional amounts for teaching in ?? staff
areas or ?? staff schools and some other ideas including the governor's
career pathways ideas but those are things that will come in the next
session and the next session but we think that what we are doing with
the base pay have given ourselves and given the people of our state and
the educators of the state the opportunity to do some special things as
far as teaching pay is concerned in the future
[speaker changes
What's your plan to defend the married woman ?? ?? yesterday
[speaker changes]
You know I released a statement yesterday that 60 plus percent of the
state wanted that provision put in our constitution I think that the
attorney general should defend our states constitution until the supreme
court has made a final decision i think we should continue to do that.
We don't have any plans at this point to do anything but as you know
there is a provision that will allow the legislative leaders to
intervene. I hope that is not necessary if it is necessary we will
consider it.
[speaker changes]
Do you think that 10 million dollars is enough to sustain an industry
that has gotten 60 to 80 million dollars in recent years and second is
there any chance for more movement on that or is the grand program on
that a done deal?
[speaker changes]
I don't see us extending the current credit program I think the grant
program is what we're working on there is a possibility that there maybe
more than the 10 million dollars currently in there for the grant
program remember what were talking about though is the current credit
program doesn't end until December 31st</p>

The local school districts determined that they need to move it back
into TA allotment. They have the full flexibility to do that. This is
really doing a better job of accounting for how that money is being
spent. Right now we know that the school systems have determined that
they want to use that TA money, pull it, and hire teachers to the amount
of 65 million dollars. Next year they have flexibility, if they choose,
from K through 3, to move all that back into teacher assistance. We
provided that flexibility so that's critically important because some
could say that we've got 65 million in teacher assistance. We haven't
done that, all we've done is acknowledge how the school system's are
currently using that money and they still continue to have the
flexibility to use it in the way they they see fit. Thank you all.
