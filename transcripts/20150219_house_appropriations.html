  Committee will come to order. Committee will come to order. Members will
take their seats. All extraneous conversations will please be taken
outside the committee room. We&#39;re gonna have a welcome for our
committee today. [??] Our pages for the week and you can please feel
free to raise your hand when we call your name. Logan Fur of Wake County
sponsored by Representative Martin. Winston Hayward of Mecklenberg
County sponsored by the Speaker. [??] McGee Camass County, sponsored by

Johnny McNeil, Wake County, sponsored by Representative Martin.
Elizabeth Stone, Wake County, sponsored by Chairman Dollar. Grace West
of Moore County sponsored by Representative Boles and Mary Margaret West
of Moore County also sponsored by Representative Boles. And we have our
sergeant at arms with us today. We will move right into the one bill
that we have on our calendar today. It&#39;s Senate Bill 14. The staff
will help us go through the bill rather judiciously I think and then,
then we have several amendments, some of which have been or will be
passed out to you. We&#39;ll get into the amendments and we&#39;ll try
to move this along. So, with that I recognize staff from either where
you&#39;re sitting if you&#39;d like or you can come up here. Either
one, and currently the first few sections I believe on the education
provisions first. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Thanks, Chairman Dollar.
My name is Brian Addison with Fiscal Research. Here&#39;s just a brief
summary of Senate Bill 14 as it&#39;s before you. Section one provides
that the State Board of Ed is to transfer $100,000 to the office of
administrative hearings to be allocated to the rules review commission
in conjunction with litigation costs incurred in defense of a case.
Funds shall not revert, but remain available through the following
fiscal year. It would be $100,000 transfer from the State Board to OH.
Section two, somewhat similar construction for a different purpose,
requires that from the Department of Construction&#39;s operating budget
that $275,000 be transferred to the Department of Administrations to
support the operations of the Academic Standards Review Commission.
There are some restrictions placed on the upcoming expenditures of the
commissions and limitations under subsections 1, 2 and 3. Section three
on the following page holds that funds don&#39;t revert also for the
funds in section two, they do not revert until the Commission terminates
on December 31st at the end of this calendar year or upon the filing of
a final report, whichever occurs first. Section four, restrictions are
placed on the Academic Standards Review Commission with respect to doing
surveys of the public and stakeholders on standards being considered by
the review commission. Section five has some requirements for the
commission to post minutes, agendas, handouts and presentations as well
as audio recordings in the Commission website and also to stream those
meetings as they happen. Then in section six, the last piece here
related to education funds that are being transferred, the State Board
of Ed in meeting the transfer and reduction needed to make the transfer
called for in section two of the act may not make reductions to the
North Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching, the residential
schools for the deaf and blind, communities and schools teacher of
American and beginnings for parents of children who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Those are all activities that fall under the administrative
umbrella of the State Board and DPI. With that, Mr. Chair, that
concludes the summary for the education section. That means the college
piece is up next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, Jane Perhoppen of the
Fiscal Research Division. Section seven of the bill clarifies the Coal
Ash Commission proceeds are divided between the Coal Ash Commission and
DNR. The Coal Ash Commission

  Is slated to get 26.5%. 26.5% and DNR will get the remaining money.
Section eight starts by providing DNR the flexibility to hire up to 25
positions rather than requiring them to hire 25 positions. It also
specifies the Coal Ash Commission&#39;s appropriation for the current
fiscal year at $630,000 and then lastly it specifies that if revenues
are insufficient to support the appropriations to the Coal Ash
commission and to DNR, then each of those two entities are to take a
proportional reduction in their budgets for the current fiscal year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, staff, what I&#39;d like to do is if there
are any questions on these sections of the bill what might be easier,
more advisable for us as a committee is to go ahead and recognize
Representative McGrady for an amendment to the Coal Ash section. We can
explain that amendment and then we can address questions that members
may have for the amendment or for the underlying provisions on Coal Ash
that way we can deal with all Coal Ash at one time. So with that in
mind, Representative, Co-Chair McGrady is recognized for an amendment
and this should be amendment number three on your desk and the gentleman
is recognized to explain his amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I believe that everybody should have gotten a copy of the
amendment. I forwarded by electronically in advance of the session too.
The amendment would do two things. First, it extends the deadline for
owners of non-Coal Ash high or intermediate hazard dams to submit an
emergency action plan, that&#39;s called and EAP, until December 31,
2005. Under the current law these EAPs would be required to be submitted
by the end of March. It also, number two, clarifies that the EAP does
not require a licensed engineer to review, approve and/or stamp the
report. Under the Coal Ash Management Act of 2014, EAPs are required to
have an engineer to complete the report. I want to take those of you who
are in the body back to the debate on the Coal Ash bill and if you
remember I stood on the floor and told you that the Coal Ash Management
Act, with the exception of one provision related to compliance
boundaries, didn&#39;t have application broader than Coal Ash ponds. I
humbly tell you now that that is not true. The dam safety provisions in
the Coal Ash Management Act apply to high and intermediate hazardous
dams whether or not they are Coal Ash impoundments and so the effect of
the bill was to require these EAPs to be put together fairly quickly by
March of this year and would require land owners to employ the services
of an engineer. My expectation with the amendment would be that
engineers would still be used by people that have very large
impoundments to put together the EAPs but some of these impoundments,
you know, are agricultural ponds and other really small things. DNR, as
I understand it if you go on their website, you will see they have
already up a way for a land owner to put together the maps that would be
required for an EAP so you don&#39;t need an engineer necessarily to do
all of this, and so the intent of the amendment then is simply two
things. One, to give those non-Coal Ash owners of high and intermediate
risk ponds additional time to get their EAPs in place, which is a new
requirement, back to the Coal Ash Management Commission

  Excuse me, Call Life Management Act that we passed last year and two to
allow them to use a simplified mapping system when they put together
their EAPs and I have, Mr. Chairman, I think I&#39;ll stop there for any
questions if there are none. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will entertain
questions for Representative McGrady or staff on the amendment or
sections seven and eight of the underlying bill. Any questions or
comments from members of the committee? Seeing none, all those in favor
of the adoption of the amendment please signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. They ayes have it and the
amendment is agreed to. The next amendment will be offered by, [??] .
Hold on just a second. Next amendment I would like to take up cause
again this also relates to two provisions that are currently in the
underlying bill, one offered by Representative Horne. Representative
Horne you are recognized to explain your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment is fundamentally a technical
correction on page one directing the funds to be paid $100,000, as soon
as I find my copy of the bill. Here it is. Line 10, $100,000 to pay for
litigation. All it does is allow the state board, DPI, to take that
money from where they can take that money. It doesn&#39;t direct them
that it has to come out of operating funds, and the same thing on line
19. We eliminate the phrase for current operations of the department,
just so by eliminating the phrase we exempted the option or the
alternative to be able to take that money where they can and not
interfere with operations, so I appreciate your support of the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would thank the gentleman for
sponsoring the amendment. I think it creates the possibility and I urge
everybody to support it. I thank the Chair for considering the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions on the amendment. If not,
all those in favor please signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The ayes have it and the amendment is
agreed to. The other two amendments are new to this bill so what we can
do at this point is the other sections that we haven&#39;t touched on
yet in the bill, for staff if there are any questions about the other
sections in the bill before we move on to the final two amendments that
are in possession of the chair. Are there any questions for staff?
Representative Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
understand we&#39;re asked about the other parts of the bill before we
get those amendments, right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The thing I was wondering about is some of the funding for
ASRC. They have made movement to bring Dr. Sanders, [??] and Dr.
Sanders-Milgram to come and speak to them. I understand is they&#39;re
planning on March 16th and there was some concern about funding for them
coming. Would the finds be appropriated here be sufficient to include
that? I was just wondering does anybody know? Would staff know or does
anybody know if it&#39;s going to be sufficient to include that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If staff can respond to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Chairman. Representative Pittman, I&#39;m not aware of what the
costs might be associated with bringing those individuals, but should
this bill pass in some form I would suspect that $275,000 would be
sufficient to first meet the requirements of the bill which says
essentially that DOE needs to be compensated for the [??] to be
somewhere less than $30,000 or that amount, leaving the remaining
operating budget to deal with the travel of those speakers and others
and I don&#39;t see anything here that would seem to [??] that

  Prohibition of, of expenditures for them to come for either of us. Other
questions? All right. We will move on to amendment number two. It&#39;s
on your desk offered by the chair and the effect of this amendment, this
addresses the economic development partnership board and this, the
effect of this amendment is just to simply allow an individual who may
have been appointed to another board or commission in state government
to be considered for the Economic Development Partnership Board and the
reason for that is that we may have other individuals on other boards
that for the sake of breaking down silos and sharing information, making
sure we&#39;re pulling in key people and with the broader implications
of the Economic Development Partnership Board, those individuals would
be potentially eligible to serve on that board. So, for example, someone
on the Community College Board could potentially be appointed to the
Economic Development Partnership Board. That&#39;s the effect of this
amendment. I know of no opposition but I&#39;d be happy to entertain any
questions from members of the committee. Seeing none, all those in favor
of the amendment, please signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. They ayes have it and the amendment is
agreed to. The last amendment that we had in possession of the chair is
an amendment offered by Chairman Lambeth, amendment number one, and
Representative Lambeth I recognize you to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment adds a section
as the Chairman said to address the issues with the Health Information
Exchange, and I know you&#39;re probably all aware of the Health
Information Exchange that was budgeted in the current year budget but no
funds have been released to this point. We had a meeting with our
colleagues in the Senate last week recognizing that that&#39;s gonna be
an important part of any discussions on Medicaid reform and there are
several things that we need to do. Number one is we need to pay our
bills going forward, so section nine you will see that we will release
the $2 million. The critical piece is on the second page, line 7-17
where it authorizes the agency to pay for the software vendor February
through the end of June, the payroll costs. These are costs that are
being incurred and we need to release those funds to be able to cover
those costs. There are two important dates in here. We&#39;ve asked the
agency to come back to us by May 1 so that we can incorporate into the
budget appropriate funding for the HIE in this next year&#39;s budget
and then we actually need to develop a longer-range plan for the HIE.
Where do want it to be? Where do we want it to go? What do we want it to
do to support our Medicaid reform plans? And so the agency will by
September 1 provide us additional information to be able to help
determine the best organizational structure for the HIE, and I&#39;m
more than happy to entertain any questions. We have reviewed this with
the Senate and it is something we&#39;re doing together. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and members, I&#39;m really glad to see this amendment. This has been in
the works for a long time and this is really just enabling language to
let us do what we need to do and have been planning to do, so it&#39;s a
good amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there other questions
or comments on the amendment? If not, all those in favor of the
amendment please signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Opposed no. The ayes have it and the amendment is agreed to and
if you will hold for just one moment. The Chair is not in possession of
any further amendments at this time. Any, before we take the motion, any
further amendments, comments, questions. If not, Chairman Johnson is
recognized for an amendment. I mean, excuse me, for a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I move that a favorable report to the Senate Bill 14 as amended
by amendments 1, 2, 3 and four and that the adopted amendments to be
rolled into a committee substitute. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And staff to make
any technical adjustments. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I did say that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You did? Okay, you said that. Alright, good.
