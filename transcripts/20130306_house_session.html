Ladies and gentlemen, we have a series of referrals. The clerk will

[Speaker Change]
The following Bills are assigned to the Regulatory Reform Sub Committee

Control.
[Speaker Change]
Noted. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, upon motion of the member from
Rowan and Cabarrus County. The Chair is happy to extend the gallery to
Elizabeth Edwards, staff person for Congressman Richard Hudson. Please
stand and let us welcome you. Representative Moore. The gentleman would
inform the body at this time that matters we propose go onto the
calendar today.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. For a motion pertaining to today’s calendar. Mr.
Speaker, members of the House, the Speaker read in the Bills that were
referred from judiciary and yesterday gave notice to members that we
would likely take those Bills up today. The Bills that we are asking to
be added are as follows; House Bill one forty seven, Amend Adoption
Laws. House Bill one eight, Mechanics Lien Technical Corrections. Senate
Bill thirty six, APA Technical Clarifying Changes. And House Bill one
forty nine, Caylee’s Law Report Missing Children. We ask that these be
added to today’s calendar Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
Without objection. Representative Hall, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Yes Mr. Speaker, just want to ask some questions about these Bills.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Change]
I do and if you could just withhold for just a second. There’s one more
Bill. Senate Bill seventy two, Amend UCC Article Four A Fund for
Transfers would be part of the motion and I’ll gladly yield to the
Minority Leader’s question.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Moore just wanted to check. These
Bills weren’t on the calendar for today so these would be Bills that the
public would not know that we are dealing with today. Is that correct?
[Speaker Change]
That’s, that’s, that’s. I would, I would actually take issue with that.
If you’ll recall, if you’ll flip to the backside of today’s calendar and
see the notice of committee meetings. Those were, these were Bills that
were all taken up in the judiciary committees today. And yesterday the
Speaker advised the body at the close of session that it was the intent
of the Speaker to add these Bills on today should they not be
controversial coming out of the, the judiciary committees. It is my
understanding that these Bills all passed with little, I think they were
all non-controversial. So if they are controversial, I guess someone
wants to raise their hand. My understanding from the committee chairs
there was no issue bringing these Bills. There were some other Bills
that were in committee today that did have some controversy, but those
weren’t reported out and they’re not a part of these Bills being added
on today.
[Speaker Change]
Just a comment Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Hall, if there is any concern what so ever with these
Bills, we will not have a skeleton session and carry these over to
tomorrow and not have any debate on it. The gentleman has the floor.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and my only concern is that again as we are down
here and we do read the calendar we do know that  be sensitive again as
much as possible to the public knowing and having an opportunity. And
I’m sure all members have people who contact them and give them
suggestion or request regarding Bills that come up. So we just ask that
that be done whenever possible so we can make sure our constituents.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s point is well taken. We will carry these matters over
except for the one that we’ve moved forward at request of one of the
members of Minority. We’ll have a vote session tomorrow.</p>

House Resolution 216. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will yield until after the bill
is read. Clerk will read.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Resolution 216, House
Resolution honoring the founders of the town of Proctorville on the
town’s 100th anniversary. The House resolves. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I
ask Representative Moore a question, just for clarity? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The last one you read in, did you say, because you
were slurring, 172? Senate Bill 172? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 72.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 72? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It was amend UCC Article 4A
Funds Transfers. Again, all of those bills were noncontroversial. I
think they all passed committee unanimously. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just by
clarification, the Chair has ruled that we will remove the no-vote
session tomorrow. All the bills that Representative Moore has suggested
for consideration today will be taken up on today’s calendar for the
first time. Representative Charles Graham, does the gentleman wish for
the resolution to be read in its entirety? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s
correct, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Whereas the town of Proctorville, located in southern Robeson
County, was named for Edward Knox Proctor Jr., prominent Lumberton
lawyer and promoter of the Raleigh and Charleston railroad who helped in
the development of Robeson County, and whereas the town of Proctorville
grew out of a 50 acre tract of land that was originally owned by Calvin
Graham and given to his slave Dennis Graham, and whereas on July 20th
1899, Augustus ?? purchased right of way for the Carolina northern
railroad from Dennis Graham and later purchased 10 acres of the original
tract on both sides of the railroad which were laid out into four blocks
then subdivided into lots with properly laid out streets, and whereas on
May 1 1900, Edward Knox Proctor Jr. purchased the 10 acre site that has
been named in his honor from Augustus ?? and upon his death the site was
purchased by W.R. Surles, and whereas the town of Proctorville was
incorporated on March 7 1913, and whereas the first offices of property
included Mayor K. Atkinson, ?? C.W. Graham, K. Barnes and J.K. Atkinson
and Constable P.P. Smith, and whereas at one time Proctorville held the
distinction of being the smallest town in the United States with its own
public library, the W.R. Surles Memorial Library, and whereas
Proctorville has continued to prosper through the continued dedication,
insight and planning of the town’s leaders and citizens, and whereas
plans have been made to celebrate the town’s 100th anniversary on March
the 9th 2013, and whereas the occasion is worthy of celebration and
should be enjoyed and supported by all North Carolinians, now therefore
be it resolved by the House of Representatives. Section 1, the House of
Representatives honors the memory of the founders of the town of
Proctorville and congratulates the town on its 100th anniversary.
Section 2, the principal Clerk shall transmit a certified copy of this
resolution to the mayor of the town of Proctorville. Section 3, this
resolution is effective upon adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Graham, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members, this
is a great opportunity and a great time to be a legislator when you can
stand up and brag about things that’s going on in your community, and
it’s a great opportunity for me to stand here and speak to this
resolution. This is a community, ladies and gentlemen, with lots of
pride, and southern Robeson County is a small, small community; as
you’ve heard, just evolved over the last 100 years. It’s a small
municipality, a farming community of 117. Very good, very strong-willed
people, taxpaying citizens in our county. This community of Proctorville
has a distinction of being a tri-racial community – Caucasian, African
American, American Indians – which have lived and thrived for 100 years
in harmony and peace, living together, being successful, and it’s an
honor to recognize this community because of their commitment to
humanity.</p>

Speaker: Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
Representative: To ask a question of Representative Hall, if I may.
Speaker: Representative Hall, does the gentleman yield?
Representative: I do.
Representative: Representative Hall, would you have any objection to
proceeding with house bill 180 today? It has some time sensitivity which
I will explain to the body.
Representative: I have no objection to 180 proceeding today.
Speaker: Without objection, we will move to house bill 180. Is there any
objection? The clerk will read.
Clerk: House bill 180, [xx] leave technical corrections. NC enacts.
Speaker: The house will be at ease. The clerk is recalling house bill
180, the other matters have gone back to the clerk and we will confirm
that it is on the dashboard. While we are waiting, we are striking the
referral to the finance committee for house bill 120; therefore, the
calendar for house committee substitute to house bill 120 calendar
unfavorable calendar. Representative Stevens is recognized to debate the
house committee substitute for house bill 120.
Representative:  Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I want to thank you
Representative Hall. This is a technical correctiosn bill, and the
reason it is important is because the law that we passed last year to
deal with mechanics [xx] leave, goes into effect April 1st. The system
that has been adopted to deal with mechanics and [xx] is a computer
based system that did not exist at the time but was in contemplation. So
the main thrust of this bill is to make some technical corrections and
to allow and authorize, specifically, that computer generated system.
That is the system that I invited you all to my office for a private
viewing. That is a system that we had a public showing of, and the
senate has agreed to hear this next week so that we can, hopefully, get
it onto the governor and hopefully have it enacted by April 1st. I will
be happy to answer any questions you have, and trust me, we have had
tough ones because we had 30 people in committee this morning who were
interested in this bill, be they builders, bankers, aggregate suppliers,
attorneys. So this bill ahs been very well vented and all the questions
asked and answered, but I will certainly be happy to answer any that you
have here or privately. Mr. Speaker, I do have staff on the floor if
needed.
Speaker: Representative Haynes, please state your purpose? Further
discussion, further debate?
Representative: That was an accident sir.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? If not, the question before the
house is the passage of the house committee substitute of house bill 180
on its second reading. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote: 114 having voted in the affirmative, none in the
negative. The house committee substitute for house bill 180 has passed
its second reading and will, without objection, be read a third time.
Clerk: NC enacts.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? If not, the question before the
house is the passage of the house committee substitute of house bill 180
on its third reading. All in favor say aye, [aye] all opposed say no
[silence]. The aye’s have it. The house committee substitute for house
bill 180 has passed its third reading and will be sent to the senate.
Ladies and gentleman of the house, earlier today house bill 228 was read
