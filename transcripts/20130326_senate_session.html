[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Then is it your position that any time, any body sues the state. That

That this should be the proper venue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To debate the amendment. Mr. president.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Ladies and gentleman I understand. That to some people receding to
enable eminent domain. Against what most of you preach, but since you
believed as I do. That the government ought to be specifically limited
when they can condemn property even a lease. At the same time I think
that we ought to have a general respect, for the proceedings judicial,
proceedings especially in the state. For hundreds of years, there have
been proceedings where any other governmental entity condemns land.
That's all we are talking about here. The condemnation of land. And
there is been a set procedure as to how those cases are decided. how the
issue of  just compensation, is decided. I say this because, again and i
remind you. That with many of you, or most of you, I'm in total sync,
with respect to the government being able to take property from anybody.
And municipalities are looked at as people. just like a private taking
from any private individual. and I can't for the life of me see, why we
are going to set up a whole new set of rules. To hear a condemnation
action. That the city of Lolly brings. On the ocean we condemn land. And
we don't put any special proceeding that people have to follow, in order
to challenge the state for condemnate. we condemn land for high ways all
the time. And the state makes people very mad. For land roads. We don't
set up any special proceeding, for how you going to any thing out of a
normal special proceeding. as I have you going to bring the action. This
quite frankly seem to be an  insult to injury, to say, that just for
this peace of land,  325 acres. We're going to change a who judicial
process. We are going to say all of a sudden, that it ought to be a tree
 judge panel to get together. And go trough all, what ever is involved
in tree judge panels meeting, in order to determine what the just
compensation. Or how you do just compensation. Let me ask you a serious
question. In North Carolina you entitled to a jury trial. In just
compensation. Thats who decides it.  So as you sit up there with this
tree judges. In a make shift court room. Because most court room aren't
design for tree judges. Its OK when you have lawyers arguing to them.
Any how so this twelve people are going to be sitting, looking at the
body language of this tree separate judges. The question of tree
separate judges, as the lawyers present the case. This is a very
cumbersome unruly proceeding. I haven't seen any were else. May be some
of the lawyers in the chamberer can tell me or some of the
circumstances. We certainly use tree judge panels when it come to re
districting. Use three judge in the matter in the  DC Court of Appeals
in some other actions. But they generally lawyer to judge. You don't
have juries involved or I don't think I don't know of  anywhere juries
are involved. I can be corrected if I'm wrong. I just thing it really is
bordering, on the nonsensical for us to be building in the special
proceeding that doesn't exist anywhere else for one case, for 325 acres
of land and I happen to believe that the only reason we are doing this,
is because we were the question</p>

[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Pate for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Would you recognize Senator Hise for a comment?
[Speaker Change]
Senator Hise is recognized to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the committee. Couple things I
wanted to talk about. We've talked, there's been a lot out there about
us going into a lease. And I wanted to point out to everyone here that
the lease itself allows for this condemnation. As a matter of fact the
lease even considers the possibility that less than 50% of the property
would be taken, and different articles for that if more than 50% are
taken. And the lease itself says that if that occurs the lessee shall
have no, and waives any claim against a resource, ?? against the lessor
for the value of the property for the term. That's within the lease that
was agreed to by the state that allows this condemnation. The two other
points that I wanted to put forward as to why we're here. The first is
the original intent of the property given to the state. I see it happen
all the time, especially in conservatories and others when individuals
give property to the state to be used for a particular purpose. That is
what we have here, as we would in today's language the treatment of the
mental health was the reason this purpose was given to the state. Today
it has a value in their last appraisal of 84 million dollars. We'll make
some decisions in the future about how much we still utilize that for
office space, and others for HHS. But it is our duty to maintain that,
that property or the value determined from that property be used to
provide for mental health services. The HHS budget is a difficult
process to go through. And the state does not need to be handing away
its revenue when people have such needs. Moving forward. And finally the
state law. Before the state was allowed to enter into a lease of
property where state employees were continued to work, they were
required to go through a process to provide for the relocation of those
state workers. A process that did not occur, a process that legislative
was required to occur. So now we come to a crossroads. A lease that was
entered into in a time period ignoring what state law was, ignoring the
original intent, and establishing a different value for the property. It
is our intent to go back within that lease and re-condemn it, and begin
a proper and legal process for the citizens of North Carolina which is
required.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Stein for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
To see if the speaker will yield to a question.
[Speaker Change]
I will yield.
[Speaker Change]
Is it your intention and the intention of this chamber to reopen Dick's
Hospital?
[Speaker Change]
There's no intent in this bill or other to reopen a mental institution
on that property that is correct.
[Speaker Change]
Follow-up.
[Speaker Change]
Senator do you yield?
[Speaker Change]
I yield.
[Speaker Change]
Are you familiar with the healing place?
[Speaker Change]
I am not.

Follow-up
[Speaker Change]
Senator do you yield?
[Speaker Change]
I yield.
[Speaker Change]
Do you know how much mental health treatment has done on Dick's property
to date?
[Speaker Change]
I would provide that most of the administration for mental health
services all across the state is done on the Dixie property at this
time.
[Speaker Change]
To debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Stein has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Currently 10 acres is dedicated to mental health today. The Healing
Place of Wake County provides mental health treatment to people. There
otherwise there are no mental health treatment being provided on Dick's
property. The hospitals been closed, a lot of people had problems about
that being closed, but the state moved it to Buckner. And that's where
mental health, the hospital is today. You all don't intend to open up
the hospital again.</p>

cost would be tens of millions of dollars. That hospital is ancient. To
say this is about mental health is a farce. It isn't about mental
health. This is about a lease that you didn't like because it was signed
by a governor you didn't like with a city you don't like. That is what
this is about.
You all cared about mental health, you had an opportunity in the first
week of this session to do something about it. I ran the net present
value of the dollar amount that senator Hise said this land is worth
versus what the lease amount is. Do you know what the annual difference
is? It's one and a half million dollars a year.
Now one and a half million dollars. That's not insubstantial. But in the
scope of the medicaid budget, which is over 3 billion dollars with a B
not an M, it is a drop in the bucket.
Over this by ??, you all rejected two and one half billion dollars in
one hundred percent federally funded medicaid dollars. Forty five to
fifty percent of which goes to mental health treatment, substance abuse
and developmental disabilities. So let's do the math on that.
One point two billion dollars at no cost to the Carolina tax payer for
mental health in North Carolina, right now, versus one point five
million over the life of this loan. And by the way, you're not going to
get that one and a half million over the life of the loan, because what
you've done is you've reduced the land that is suitable to the lease. As
senator Hunt has noted in committee, it is a flood plain. It is a former
land fill site. It is not the nice property of Dix. So even if you got a
fair market value for that it will not be substantially more than what
the half million dollars it goes from the city to the state for mental
health under the current lease. So we are talking  hundreds of thousands
a year when you all forgo a billion dollars this year. Do not make this
about mental health because it isn't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask speaker a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, are you aware of the federal designation of a institute
of mental disease or an IMD?.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yield for another question, senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you also be aware that under what the federal government, Dorothea
Dix hospital and others, that medicaid funding can not be used
regardless of the expansion or otherwise to provide for services for any
individual in an institution or institute of mental disease?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am aware of that but that doesn't mean it can't go for mental health
purposes. To think that the only way to deliver mental health care to
the people of North Carolina is in an institution is a backward way of
thinking of mental health treatment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
mister president.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister president, ladies and gentlemen of the senate, you first probably
given us a good little gift because the supreme court in the courts of
North Carolina are going to get the opportunity to decide the
constitutionality of this little amendment that you just passed. You can
get advised any way you want to. You can't set up a special proceeding
for one specific case. You've got to do it class wide. And so, when you
say this is the only condemnation case that's going to be subject to
this procedure. Expect the supreme court read the law to you. But also
you build into this thing greater uncertainty. Because now you build a
process that's going to take multiple years to get a final answer to.
Whether or not this lease purports is what this lease purports to be.
Let me address three things first. Senator Pate says it's not fair
market value. The city and the state had appraisals done on this
property before this agreement was entered into. One appraisal was
thirty something million and the other was sixty some million. So there
were appraisals done. The state appraised it for its highest and best
use which it determined to be</p>

for an office complex. For commercial, so that people could put 40-50
story high rises out there. Now you can- If you haven't taken a trip
over to Dorothea Dixon campus, I really would urge you to go out South
Sunder Street or come up Lake Wheeler Road, after dark, and just
overlook the Raleigh skyline from that campus on Western Boulevard. But
the appraisal was to put high rises of mixed use development on the
property. Not to save it as a mental health institution. And the city
was appraising it on a different standard, and not strictly as a park,
but one that wasn't so intentionally developed. And when you consider
the statement made by Sen. Pate that it was breaking state law, I don't
know what state law he's referring to, if the city and the state both
got the kinds of appraisals that were required. Now Dorothea Dix
hospital was on a site that was over 2,000 acres. That's 25, almost 30
years ago. Sen. ??, Sen. Nesbitt and I are probably the only ones who
were here and all three of us were in the House when that campus was
broken up because they no longer needed a farm. They didn't need those
who were mentally ill, when the facility was full, to go out and work on
farms and do the other things that they used to do. And so the State
made the decision, initially in the Jim Hunt administration but followed
up in the Martin administration, the State made the decision that we
don't need to be maintaining a farm out here if we're not farming on it.
No prisoners were available to farm on it, the mentally ill were no
longer institutionalized they were being sent out into communities. And
the population of the hospital had decreased substantially, I think down
to less than 500 patients. And so the state, the council estate and the
Governor decided to reduce the footprint of the campus. And that's how
the centennial campus at North Carolina State University was born.
That's how the current farmer's market was located. Both on Dorothea Dix
property. Now Sen. Hise raises a question as to what the purpose of the
land was. I dare tell you that the value of the centennial campus at
North Carolina State University is far greater than anything even those
of us who agreed that it ought to be given to the state, that is, 5 or 6
hundred acres of land, than we even imagined that it could be. Because
you started this session talking about jobs. You want to talk about
jobs? Look at some of the institutions, the businesses that have come
out of not necessarily the centennial campus, which is poised to be the
job creator for the next 50 years, not only for the triangle area, but
for the entire state of North Carolina. You see, business that have
become Fortune 500 companies that have come out of research that happens
at North Carolina State, ??. Biggest of its kind in the world. Cree, the
lighting giant, a Fortune 500 company. Red Hat, a Fortune 500 company
that was located on the campus, on Centennial campus at North Carolina
State University. So, the revenue that comes from the jobs created by
those entities could be used to adequately provide for mental health, if
we were concerned and committed to adequately providing for it. But
that's not the only thing. Sen. Pate talked about, &quot;It's supposed
to serve the mentally ill.&quot; That's how we serve them, by serving
them with programs that they need now, not programs to basically
institutionalize them on a hundred year old campus. We talked about the
transition costs for moving the people who work for the Department of
Human Resources. You know, for the last 25 years, there have been
studies and suggestions by the Capital Planning Commission, and I think
some of you are on it, and by various other groups as what to do about
the Human Services or Human Resources employees.  There's still been no
resolution to that, but this lease contains a provision in it that
addresses the point</p>

That Senator Pate made.  Because it said for 15 years, those employees
can stay on the Dorothea Dix Campus, as the state develops a transition
plan. You know at one point, and some of you may have been part of it,
there was a plan to build a high rise right across the street.  Right
across the street, to house the human resources employees, because there
were so many of them.  And it would bring them back into the state
complex.  And to consolidate some of these offices that we have around
Wake county and around the state.  So it still brings ???, but the lease
is not the reason that you can’t make plans for transition, because it
allows for that transition.  Senator Hise says the lease allows
condemnation. Now, I want you to use two witnesses that show up in court
every day, and they show up in your lives every day. One is human
nature, and the other is common sense. Now, what idiot would enter into
a contract, thinking that it’s a bilateral contract, giving the other
party the total right to walk away from the contract whenever they wants
to.  That’s not a contract.  So if you have a provision in this lease
that says that the state can condemn it any time, it’s a unilateral
agreement.  The state is the only one that has any power under that
agreement. The state can say I don’t like it any longer, five years into
the lease.  I don’t like it. I’m going to condemn my own lease. That’s
what’s offending all of these business people.  And you’ve heard from a
lot of them.  Now, I’ve been around this building for a pretty good
while. And I saw business people show up last night, at a hearing we had
here in Wake County, who I know very well, who I work closely with.
This is people of every political stripe that you can dream of, business
people with all kind of talent, but who have never set foot in this
building.  You know, we had Jim Goodmon last week come talk to the
committee. Now Goodmon happens to be president of Capitol Broadcasting,
one of the biggest CVS affiliates in the country.  But, he also started
a development company.  And Jim Goodmon’s companies created the American
Tobacco Complex in Durham. And Goodmon told you that I’ve created 3,500
jobs in that American Tobacco Complex.  And yes, I’ve been part of some
of the decisions about the kinds of jobs going on. And he has, 3500
jobs, totally revitalized downtown Durham, one of the most vibrant
places, not only in the state, but in the South now because of the kinds
of jobs that are created in a. New companies have come into the American
Tobacco Complex in Durham, not only locally developed, but companies
from around the country, and the world.  And Goodmon said, look, I’m
part of Greg Poole. By the way, Greg Poole has created one of the
biggest Caterpillar dealerships in the country. Been involved in our
efforts with Caterpillar over the years.  They got major facilities in
North Carolina.  And Greg Poole was the one who, a long time ago, had a
vision that we could make Dick’s Park something different. That we could
take this place, that’s going to become basically a haven for high rises
and commercial development, and we can make it something special.  And
Greg Poole, republican by the way, solicited the business community
around this county, this city, and this state.  And they called
themselves the Dick’s visionaries, and for eight or nine years, they
have been talking to the state, they have been developing plans, they’ve
been giving money, millions of dollars themselves, to help develop this
destination park, not just for the city of Raleigh, but for the state of
North Carolina.  The kind of park that you think about when you look at
Chicago, or San Francisco, or New York, or other cities. Because they
got the vision to see that if Raleigh, ??? was one of the fastest
growing areas in the country over the last ten years, in fact grew by
47%, then pretty soon, it’s going to be an area with over two million
people.  Over two million people, and it deserved a park like other
world class places.  And that this could be a place to do it. And so,
they recruited business people, not politicians like us, but ???
business people in supporting and urging the Raleigh city council to
work with the state to create this park.  And you saw, over the last
three or four days, those business people coming to tell you how
important this was.  Last night, had a fellow named Temple Sloan, not a
slow drag when it comes to business and development.</p>

Founded General Auto Parts, General Parts International. 4400 Sales
outlets that sell car parts and you know, you look at all of these kinds
of people who've been involved in it. General Parts International,
selling conquest, more than half the stores owned by the company that he
still sells his ?? out of. Temple Sloan also sells his chair of Howards
Properties. One of the most prolific development firms, and office firms
in the south, or in the country, Howards Properties. 45 million square
feet of space under management. They know about creating jobs. What did
Temple Sloan tell us last night? Temple Sloan said that this park has
the potential to develop more jobs than anything he has seen other than
the Research Triangle Park itself. Because of the kinds of development
around it, and the kinds of people that you can attract to it. Now these
are people not just names that I'm throwing to you, but people who have
the skin in the game, and they know what job development is all about,
and the kinds of things to develop it. And you're totally ignoring them.
And why are you ignoring them? Because of a vendetta saying that the
Governor and the council state didn't have power to do what they did.
They been doing it that way for a couple of hundred years. They've been
doing it that way for a couple of hundred years, the process they went
through to execute this lease is a legitimate process that we use in
this state. There's nothing illegitimate about what they did in
December. They got with these business folk in the city of Raleigh and
decided that we can make this dream and this vision a reality. Now let
me tell you this lease was negotiated in good faith and it was executed
in good faith, and it was executed in a spirit of partnership. Because
those state players understood the potential for job creation, and the
potential of a world class park. That would benefit the whole state and
its people, and not just the people of Raleigh. Didn't happen in a
vacuum, as some people would have you believe. I will tell you two last
things. It's not just another park, if Raleigh wanted just another park
we got well over a 150 parks in this city, some very good parks. Some of
you've been to Pullman Park, Chavez Park, and other parks. This is not
just another park like that. We believe in parkland and open space, in
this city, and in this county. But this is something special my friends,
and I'm not talking to you from the sentimental standpoint. If you
really believe in job creation, you talk with those people that I've
just mentioned, or you talk to some of the people in Governor McCoy’s
commerce department. And they will tell you the potential of this
project to create more jobs and all the stuff we've been funding with
millions of state dollars over the past several years. They all think
that it's more productive potentially, then everything but Research
Triangle Park. And I say that again, because that has been the saving
grace of a whole portion of this state. 50 years ago, 60 years ago when
it was envisioned, nobody thought it would do what it has done. But I
suggest to you that 30 years ago nobody thought that Sentinel Campus
would do what it has done. And it's future potential over the next 30,
40 years. Not only to continue developing jobs for this area but for our
entire state and region. Now it will be something to be concerned about
if in fact you were giving land to a private entity. This is a city of
Raleigh, it as public as the state of North Carolina. It was created by
the state, it can be dissolved by the state. The same taxpayers who pay
tax in Raleigh, pay tax to North Carolina. We constitute in this county
now 10% of the population and failure to get bent out of shape because
you think that someway or other over time the state is getting 20, 30
million dollars less than what it deserves is missing the boat. The
state still owns this land, the city is gonna spend over a hundred
million dollars in developing a park that the state will own at the end
of the lease. The state still has the feed of this land, the state will
own the improved park, and can do whatever it wants to with it. And
hopefully will take the money that's generated by all the economic
activity around it.</p>

It has this much beautiful, quality open space in the center of town
that could become a central feature to that state's, that city's
identity on a going forward basis. Think about the arch in St. Louis.
You think all the tourists that come to that arch in St. Louis don't
benefit the state of Missouri? Think of Central Park in New York City.
All the tourists. My kids, they love running through New York City
Central Park. That's tax money that's spent in the state of North, of
New York. We have a chance here to benefit the state of North Carolina.
I voted to acquire Chimney, Chimney, Chimney Rock to become a state
park. That benefits North Carolina even though it's out West. I voted
for the yak and valley, yak and river bridge on I-85. Why? Because even
though it's located outside of Charlotte it benefits the state of North
Carolina. The state is nothing but an aggregation of its component parts
of which Wake County is a central element. Red Hat, homegrown
enterprise, more than four, five thousand employees nationally, one
thousand of whom are moving to downtown Raleigh. Mr. Whitehurst says
working together our community recognizes the benefits of appropriately
developed land into a destination park, a park on the level of Central
Park in New York or Millennium Park in Chicago. Parks like that not only
preserve valuable green space for increasingly dense urban centers,
they're also economic drivers for their communities. Such a destination
park is the next chapter in the growth story of Raleigh and of North
Carolina. Why is it that Mr. Whitehurst can understand what's in the
state's interest, but you all can't? Your short-sightedness is
astounding. Senator Blue did a wonderful job highlighting how irrational
your focus and obsession with fair market value is. There are literally
dozens, dozens of instances of intergovernmental transfers and leases
across the state. Senator Hise, one of your first bills that you passed
as a freshman Senator was to allow for the transfer of a vacant prison
to your, to the community college in your community for one dollar.
That's fine. That is a good use of a public asset for a public purpose.
There is no public purpose more public than a park. It isn't going for
private development, this lease. It is going for a park for the benefit
of every person in this state. Your bill actually will make it
substantially more likely that it will be condemned for private
developers. I can't wait till the constitutional amendment comes before
us about that you can't condemn public property, I mean private property
for a private development interest. But what the lease says, what your
bill says is if you can't work out a deal with Raleigh, it goes to the
highest bidder. Well who's that gonna be? Someone who wants to put a
skyrise up. Are there people who wanna put skyrises up in Central Park
New York today? You bet there are. Does that make a lick of sense? Of
course not. This is an unbelievable once in a lifetime opportunity that
you all are throwing away. Ya'll want to change the motto of the state
to North Carolina, the state that breaks its contracts. We have a
contract valid, we heard it in committee. What this is really about is,
this is a late in the session deal. Even Senator Pate, which by the way,
you're familiar with Wayne County's transfer of a hundred and twenty
nine acres for zero dollars. Zero dollars. Wayne County went to the Old
Waynesborough commission. That was a deed, that wasn't a lease. I don't
have a problem with that, Senator Pate. Why, because I bet you all are
putting that to good use, use that benefits the people of our state. How
you can't see that a park is for the interest of the people of the
state, I don't understand. Intergovernmental transfer happen all the
time. What Temple Sloan, head of Highwoods Property, General Parts
International said yesterday is, he said I'm a businessman. I don't
break my word, let alone a written contract. The fact that the lease</p>

encouraged or contemplated. What it means is it's a breach of the
contract. Anybody who negotiates a contract, knows that you put in
provisions for breaches.  What you are doing is breaching the contract.
This story has been in the San Francisco Press. Companies there are
choosing, do I wanna' be in San Francisco or do I wanna' be in Raleigh
or Wake County. This is the signal you are sending across this country.
Someone else testified at our delegation meeting yesterday...&quot;North
Carolina's not Venezuela&quot;. We don't just appropriate
things...expropriate things.  Do not turn us into Venezuela. Vote
against this very short-sighted legislation.
[Speaker changes.] Any further discussion or debate?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] You have the floor to speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] We've heard alot from our Senators from Wake County
today but I stand and speak as one of the Senators who's not from Wake
County. And in doing so, I think of the unique opportunity we have as a
state to honor the contract that we signed.  A contract that's legally
binding, a contract that we should honor, a contract that we should
enforce, a contract that we should recognize. Back away from what would
be the wrong thing to do...morally and legally.  If you'll look at those
unique urban amenities that have been spoken of today, those resources
such as Central Park in New York City or Golden Gate Park out in San
Francisco...and I look at what we have here in our city's capitol.  This
unique opportunity, this land which is strategically located in a way
that can serve as a regional amenity and I guarantee it, there will be
people coming from a hundred miles away, coming to use this park and the
facilities that it offers...and not only will it generate growth on its
borders and on its periphery, not only will it enhance the quality of
life for those that use its facilities, but it does something positive
in terms of identification of the city of Raleigh, our state's capitol
for what it has the potential to become. I hear about these compensation
arguments but these compensation arguments vacillate so much from week
to week, month to month...depending upon whether it's a prison, whose
district it's in...depending upon whether it's an airport in the city of
Charlotte...and you're taking away from the city and giving to a wholly
new independent entity and ?????? say we're gonna take the debt and
we're not gonna reimburse you and compensate you for the years and
millions of dollars that went into it. Let's be consistent. If we're
gonna sit here and use fair market value, use it consistently. Let's not
vacillate from week to week, month to month, depending upon what's
convenient and what the issue of the day happens to be. If you sit here
and you go out there and you do a fair market evaluation, based upon the
use of this property as park land, my best guess it's gonna come back
and it's gonna say that, basically what the city of Raleigh's paying
right now would've been fine. If you look at highest and best use,
putting skyscrapers in there, that might be a wholly completely
different outcome. But when you have this unique opportunity, to
preserve 300 acres right in the midst of an urban area...and to create
something new, distinctive as a destination...that will improve the
quality of life, not only for those in Raleigh and Wake County, for
those throughout the state of North Carolina...all those school kids you
see, coming through here on a regular, on-going basis...coming to view
the museums.  All the others that will come as a destination, all those
businesses that will want to be near that destination...we should do it!
And we should help the city of Raleigh and help these leaders and do all
that we can to help this dream come to fruition.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] If Senator Hise would answer a question please?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Hise, yield for a question?
[Speaker changes.] I will.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President.  Senator Hise, is there
anything in this bill that prohibits the city of Raleigh, at some point
in the future, from having a park as being described here?
[Speaker changes.] No sir.  There is actually the opposite, in that the
requirement when we go back to the master plan...that Raleigh is that
they give it the first right of refusal on the lease of property to have
the park that they intended to have.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rucho follows up.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Hise, as part of our legislative
responsibility and fiduciary responsibility since many of us at the time
of the decision....</p>

And ask that it be delayed because of the fact that there were some
questions about the lease and some of the lease we didn’t even get a
chance to see it until after the cabinet had reviewed it. But the
covenants and restrictions it’s my understanding requires that this
money that is accumulated from this property, be used for mental health
or any kind of activity would be used for mental health in the state. Is
that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you yield for a follow up?
Senator Hise, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, thank you. I guess the last question is, therefore shouldn’t we
as a legislative body have the fiduciary responsibility to be sure that
the best price and this is representing all the people of the state of
North Carolina, not just Raleigh. But the best price that is available
so that money could have its most effective use in helping mental health
as is required by that property? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that is our
duty and our obligation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Senator Hise will yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Hise, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Rucho just asked and you responded that this legislation does not
prevent the city of Raleigh from having a new lease issued over the park
land. Is it for the same property for which they have a current lease?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They have the option for entering into the park based
on what is left over from the planning process of the state in 2007,
2008. If that planning process determined that parts of the property
would be better used for the new headquarters for the Department of
Health and Human Services or others, then the remainder of the property
which I think comes to close to about 300 acres, would be available to
the city of Raleigh to have a park. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator yield for a follow up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To make sure I understand, the city of Raleigh currently has a
lease for the entire 300, approximately 300 acres. And that what your
bill in section 4 says, lines 31 to 33 on page 2, or at least that was
the original bill before the amendment, is that the city can only lease
what is the former landfill and the flood plane, which is to the west,
but the rolling hills with the oak trees, the beautiful part of the park
that looks out to the skyscape of Raleigh, is not even eligible for them
to get a lease. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr., that would not be accurate. I
think, I don’t know the ?? we did in the committee presentation some
graphical representations of the two options that were originally
presented in the last state plan. It is my believe that somewhere around
the neighborhood of 260, 270 acres of the 310 that is originally there,
would still be available for lease. Depending on which one of those two
options were considered the best use by the state, and provided for the
relocation of nearly 1800 state employees that currently work on that
site. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Final follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do
you yield for a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So you believe, and I do
not believe I am inaccurate, in stating in section 4A, lines 31 to 33,
I’ll just draw your attention to it, the Department of Administration
shall lease at fair market value, a portion of the property identified
in the 2007 state government facilities master plan as suitable for a
public park. I am exceedingly familiar with what that map is and what
the master plan looks like and it only includes a portion and it is the
portion which is flood plane and are you saying that I’m wrong? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] There are two options presented in that plan and both represent
about 80 to 85% of the park property that they are currently discussing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will Senator Hise yield for
a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise,
you heard me read a list of various leases, and leases particularly and
even deeds that the state had entered into with other governmental
entities. Are you familiar with those transactions? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m familiar with some of those transactions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you
think it would be fair, since you figured out a way you think to condemn
this lease, for the state to go back and collect fair market value for
the other leases that it has entered into over the last ten years?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, I would agree that none of those leases that
I’m aware of involved the relocation of state employees from a current
work site, none of those had a specific law that was involved, that
required before that agreement could be entered into, that we made a
relocation plan</p>

...for those State employees, we failed to do so, but in this Dix
property, it is clear that there is many State employees working there.
A significant percentage of all of the HHS employees in the State.
Almost 17,000 - 18,000 individuals working out there, that no plan was
made for their reallocation or what to do with those individuals. And
simply saying you can figure it out in 15 years does not constitute a
plan.
I will also talk about you brought up the first bill I read for ??
Community College, the property transferred from the Department of
Corrections. Community College intended to use for law enforcement
training. A process that took so long in moving that by the time the
property transferred there was but one use left for the property. It had
been vandalized and decayed to the point that the local fire departments
were able to use it for fire training. That's what was left of that
department because they had to burn it to the ground, because it had
been so mismanaged by the State and lost its value.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do I take that to mean that your answer is you don't
think the State ought to go back and collect the fair market value for
these other leases and deeds that it's entered into?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I take it to mean that the State should follow its own
laws and when the State fails to follow its own laws, additional action
is sometimes required.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, are you aware of the fact that if the
State has not followed its own laws, there are procedures in the court
to rectify the State not following its own laws? As opposed to the
General Assembly unilaterally going back on the State's word and voiding
a lease? So that we're the ones not keeping the word of those who have
the authority to make it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Senator, I am also aware that there is wording in
this language that allows for any entity that has the authority to
condemn that property and to do so without compensation back to the
lessee. That's the agreement the City of Raleigh entered into in coming
forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Senator Nesbitt, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate. I
feel like I need to bring a little something else into this
conversation. I've raised it on several occasions, where we are taking
assets from other people as if we have the absolute power of, we're the
deciders about who gets to keep whatever they've got. We finally got the
opinion in the Rucho case, as I'm sure it will become known as it works
its way to the Supreme Court. And basically, I'll read this from the
summary here from Vance Holloman. And you all, I'm sure, have the
opinion. You can read it for yourself.
He states that, as the opinion states, &quot;It raises a number of legal
issues including potential claims of bondholder rights under the
contract clause of the United States Constitution, potential events of
default under the documents governing the issuance of the city's revenue
bonds, potential violation of GS 15993, the State's agreement with
holders of revenue bonds such as city airport revenue bonds.&quot;
Moreover it goes on to discuss, &quot;These issues identified with
Senate Bill 81 give rise to matters that have never been decided by our
courts and we believe the legal uncertainty could result in potential
long litigation.&quot;
And here's the important piece. This is the one I keep telling you all
that we're wading into. &quot;Furthermore, we believe such a legislation
could have an&quot;...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquire the Chair, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we talking about Dix property or Charlotte
Airport? I'm confused.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. We're talking about the
State having to begin to disclose on bond issues for Henderson County or
Mitchell County for Fayetteville that...</p>

And I’m fixin’ to read the paragraph [CROSSTALK] ?? In reference to our
rules I think it’s rule 16 or something where we come back and debate a
bill we’ve already voted on. I think we’re getting awfully getting close
to violating that rule. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt
please your comments focused on the bill at hand. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you sir. If we continue with this bill and we take
another piece of property that does not belong to us from a city, he has
said the fact that a North Carolina Government issuer of bonds which
Wade county is has lost ownership and control of an asset as a result of
the General Assembly action would have to be disclosed in the official
statement of any future revenue bond offering. The disclosure could
affect the cost of borrowing and the desirability of North Carolina
revenue bonds. Now I know we don’t like facts around here and we don’t
want to hear anything that doesn’t back up what we’re doing. But when
you start in this state to violate contracts and violate those two
principles that Senator Blue brought up a while ago it has
ramifications. We lose our ability to be trusted by the business
community. Certainly by bond holders by the people of this state. And if
you think this thing’s got anything to do with mental health you ain’t
been looking. For those of you who still have an LME left their fixin’
to try to merge them all down to just as few as they can possibly have.
When they gave us the waiver which gave us flexibility to manage our
LMEs they cut the money 15% over what they had spent as the state of
North Carolina on Medicaid the year before. And said now they won and
you make that work. Well you cain’t make that work. Those are
entitlement programs. Now they slowed down after finished ruining ours.
But the’re coming for yours. We took a severe cut in the money, in the,
in the reserve accounts that the various LMEs had which gave them
financial stability. There’s been nothing I’ve seen around here in the
last two years and there could be good reason for it. I mean you can say
we don’t have any money. We had to do what we had to do. But I haven’t
seen us move mental health up forward. You’re not going to put mental
health treatment back on the Dix property. If you do you’ll pay for it
100% with state funds cuz they’re not going to let you put them in those
buildings and pay you Medicaid. We have got to start livin’ up to our
word. And I thought well the Democrats can’t tell y’a. The lawyers can’t
tell y’a. Nobody will listen to any of them. Maybe the business
community they can tell y’a. And they came to our finance committee the
other day and they told y’a. How are we to believe anything you say from
now on? You’re gonna damage our ability to grow, our ability to bring
companies to this state, our ability to be respected, for potentially
the bond rating at least of local governments and potentially that of
the state. And I ask that we please stop this nonsense before we destroy
the integrity of this state. This is the integrity of this state. Our
ability to be trusted. And I ask you to vote against the bill. [SPEAKER

question before the Senate is the passage of the committee substitute to
