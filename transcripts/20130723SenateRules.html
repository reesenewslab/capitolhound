Let's come to order. Let me introduce our pages today. When I call your
name, raise your hand. Let us see you. We have Dee Anthony from Wake
Forest. Dee, welcome. Dee, were you hear last week? Well, thank you for
coming back. Nicholas Crowe, where are you, Nicholas? He's back from
last week also. I guess he's working. Is it John McCouda? Is that
correct? Welcome. Nightdale. No, you're from Greensboro, excuse me. Andy
Schiver from Nightdale. Where's Andy? And Caleb Reed. Where's Caleb?
Were you hear last week? Welcome back. Thank you for volunteering. It's
unusual somebody wants to come back to this place. Tayvon Holland.
Where's Tayvon? Welcome, Tayvon. Renee Ward. Welcome, Renee. Alberto
Lopez? Welcome. And Ben McNair, welcome. We'd like to thank you for
coming. Hope you have an enjoyable time. I believe we have every
sergeant at arms we have on staff here. So we're not going to read them.
This is going to be our order of business today. Number 1, House Bill
491. Number 2, 2013 speakers appointments. Number 3, amend pharmacy
laws. House Bill 675 and then the last but not least 589. Let's bring
forward House Bill 491. School Resource officers Lee County. [INAUDIBLE]
moves that we bring the PCS before us for discussion purposes on 491.
All in favor say aye.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] 491 before
us. Senator Rabon. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. House Bill
491 is a school resource officer bill. It's a local bill for Lee County.
It provides security in the schools of Lee County by experts in
security. I.e., the county sheriffs. It's a cooperative effort between
local government and the sheriff's office. We have a resolution that
passed. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Senator Rabon. Uh, Senator Hise was
over there whirling a favorable report as to the PCS unfavorable adds to
the original bill. All in favor, say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir? [SPEAKER CHANGE] We have some
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Oh. Go, on. Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank
you, Mr. Chair. If I'm reading this thing correctly, the school system
now handles its own resource officers. And they've actually been given
certification as a company police agency. I guess that's kind of like a
university police force or something. Is that the status quo? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Yes, that is a status quo and the board of commissioners and the
sheriff and others in the community decided that they'd like to change
that. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator, follow up. And where is the school board
on that? [SPEAKER CHANGE] The school board I don't know if they're here
to answer the question on that or not sir. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Have they
done a resolution? [SPEAKER CHANGE] The commissioners have a resolution,
yes. I don't know about the school board. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator, Mr.
Chair,  let me do this. This is a house bill. So he's probably just
walking this dog. When I look at this stuff, most of the school systems
are going towards where Lee County is. It's my understanding they want
to be able to create their own resource officers and control their own
buildings. And I think there's some concern about having people as the
resource officers that are not subject to their control. And I think
that's appropriate. I can promise you if something happens in the
school, we're going to hold the schools responsible. We're not going to
hold the sheriff responsible. We're not going to hold the commissioners
responsible. We're going to hold the school board. And I know you all
have already changed the way you're going to elect your school board.
Apparently, there's something going on down there that people don't like
their school board. But are the people in Lee County going to look to
the school board to run the schools? Or are you slowly taking all that
away? [SPEAKER CHANGE] I'm not in charge of Lee County and I didn't walk
that part of the dog, sir, but I will tell you.</p>

That the local schoolboard is good for education. The people there have
decided the ones that elected officials from the representative through
the county commissioners. And to include the county sheriff and his
people. Have decided they want to make a change. I've never known when
change would be necessarily hurtful.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just pulled up in the
resolution from the wake, I mean the Lee county. Schoolboard, which
evidently is considered in equal regard to the Wade county schoolboard
around here. But they say that they were never consulted or given
notice. They have, has been no basis or reasons to fire the SRO officers
and the security and protection of our schoolchildren had never been
questioned, so the people elected with responsibility for the
schoolchildren during the school day are the, is the schoolboard of Lee
county and they are firmly opposed to this. So I don't see why we would
be wading into their local mess in Lee county. And we should stay out of
it.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any comments senator?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's one opinion and we have
another. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions from the committee? Hearing and
all those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

The speaker here. No I don't see him. Tim Bruntsetter, you wanna step
forth and do this?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Appointments this? [SPEAKER

is the 2013 appointments bill. Ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Nesbit's amendment they haven't prepared yet. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator

?? all those in favor say aye. All ye opposed, so passes.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nThank you Mister Chairman, and Senator Tillman has agreed to
handle this bill on the Senate floor.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nHey you want
it to pass. Okay, the next bill is 589. Let's discuss this before we go
forth. Anyone who would like to speak on this bill will need to sign up
back here. We'll limit discussion to two minutes per person. We want
everybody to have time to chat about this, and we're more than willing
to stay here as long as it takes. Also, we're not gonna have any
outbursts or anything of that nature. I think all signs have been
confiscated. So let's get started. We have House bill 589, PCS, it's in
a ??? that we bring to PCS for 589 ???. All those in favor say aye. Any
opposed say no. Okay 589's before Senator Rucho. Welcome.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nThank you Mr. Chairman and members of the Rules Committee.
What we do have before us is a reform of a our dated, archaic form of
state election code that hasn't been adjusted in many years. At least
three decades. What we have is reforms to introduce transparency, to the
election process, and to create guidelines that everyone can understand
very clearly and simply. It also gives every opportunity to eliminate
any political gainsmanship. What it does also is it fulfills a campaign
process that all of us have made, and that is of election reform.
Insuring both integrity and that voters will show a photo identification
at the polls, and what this does is it reestablishes a confidence in the
electoral process, and therefore, our government. We will go point by
point through this, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Churchill, this chairman will end
up explaining this. But some of the high points will include photo
identification, which I think everyone has had a chance to review that
bill. Early voting changes which help streamline and make the system
work smoothly as intended when Senator Nesbit and I worked on some of
that way back when, in '97 I think it might have been. And then talking
about some campaign finance reform, and other changes that will be
address in this bill, because it is incomprehensive in nature. Which
will talk about the proper method of withdrawal from election races, and
help us get more people involved in when they vote that some of the down
ballot candidates and the down ballot initiatives will be included in
the election so folks don't just look at the top part of the ballot, but
will be able to have their voice throughout the entire ballot. And then
we also are looking at trying to make North Carolina a bit more relevant
in the Presidential elections. And so we have a proposal to handle the
Primary at that time. Mr. Chairman ??? be kind enough if Mr. Cohen would
go through point by point of these, and Ms. Churchill will help on that
and therefore everyone will have a clear picture as to what's included
in this bill.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nSenator Rucho I was looking forward to
you doing it and I brought a translator in to tell us what you had said
but we'll defer to Senator Cohen there.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank you,
Mr. Chairman. The first six parts of the bill, pages one through 14, are
the voter identification committee ??? that was distributed to the
committee last week. Which I'll be glad to answer questions about at the
end. With two minor changes on page two, it was clarified that military
IDs are acceptable even if they don't have an expiration date. And also
in the assistance to voters in hospitals and nursing homes provision on
page 12, the period in which the country board of elections has to
respond to a request to send out a non-partisan team to assist as was
enacted in 1983 has now reduced to 15 days to seven days to conform to
the fact that devoting cuts off seven days before the election, the
request. That's the only change from which you saw last week in the
voter ID process. Section eight, part seven on party 14 and 15 says to
study the process for filling vacancies and the general...</p>

Assembly, current statute basically derives from 1953 hasn’t really been
substantially changed since then.  Part 8 requires that if there’s a
vacancy in the US Senate that the person appointed be of the same party
as the person vacating the office, there’s seven or eight other states
that have this and the legislature can regulate the process by which the
governor makes appointments to fill vacancies if it chooses to allow
gubernatorial appointments.  Part 9 asks for review of filling vacancies
in the US House of Representative which really hasn’t changed since
about 1946.  Part 10 takes the provisions of a House passed bill
requiring all special elections by local governments be held at the same
time as some other election in that city or county with some exceptions
for bond issues in the case of a public health emergency.  That takes us
through, hang on a second here, page 27 at the bottom, part 12 regulates
the pre registration of 16 year olds and that goes on through page 30.
Page 31, Part 13 provides that with the exception of military and
overseas absentee ballots which can be transmitted and issued
electronically that the original signature of the voter has to appear on
it, not some computer generated signature. Page 14 provides that a
person doing voter registration cannot be compensated by the basis of
the number of forms they turn in, they can still be compensated for
doing paid voter registration, but cannot be compensated for the basis
of forms because there’s been some abuse of people with an incentive to
turn in false forms if they get paid by the number of forms.  Part 16
starting on page 31 eliminates same day voter registration during early
voting. Part 17 makes a slight amendment to the overseas and absentee
voting act.  The Federal law only requires 45 days, our bill that was
introduced past two years ago required 60 days.  The problem is the
national conventions have been moving later and later, last time the
Democratic convention didn’t finish their nominations until 61 days
before the election and in 2016 due to the Olympics the conventions will
be a week later, so this just says the 60 day requirement is waived as
long as they get it done within 3 days after the parties finishing their
nominations for President. Part 18 is a House passed bill as is that
requires the state at least twice a year to make an effort to under the
provisions of federal law do list maintenance and also to enter to data
sharing agreements with states cross checking information under their
states voter rolls.  Part 19 eliminates a statutory mandate for a voter
registration drive which actually predates mail in voter registration.
Part 20 makes it clear that anyone in the state can get access to
everyone’s voter registration record not just residents of a county
getting access to theirs in their county.  Also section 20.2 provides
that any registered voter of the county can make challenges anywhere in
that county not just in the precinct.  Part 21 says if you need to
withdraw as a candidate after filing in the primary you have to withdraw
at least prior to the close of business on the third business day before
that to stop the prearranged withdrawing 2 minutes before the deadline
and having somebody along with you to file.  Part 22 lowers slightly the
signatures required if you want to file a petition instead of paying
your filing fee.  There’s been very few petitions filed under this
opt-out statute, in any case Part 23 says for a nominee, a part nominee
to withdraw as a candidate they have to withdraw prior to the time when
absentee ballots start being sent out, right now the statute appears to
allow withdraws up to 30 days before the election, which is when ballots
were sent out 30 years ago when the statute was written.  Part 24 asks
for a study by joint legislative elections oversight committee, which
will being all the studies mandated by this bill to look at do we need
to change optimal precinct sizes accessibility, size of the polling
place, parking, etc.  Part 25 provides that early voting instead of
starting on the third Thursday before the election will start on the
second Thursday and mandates that it end at 1pm on that last Saturday
there was, the current statute allows county board of elections to
extend it until</p>

Pm in which a few counties have used that. 26 has a standardized process
to approve satellite polling places of which there's 3 in the state.
Makes it the same process as allowing out of precinct polling places.
Currently there are statues allowing polling places to actually be
located outside of the precinct if there's no suitable polling place
within the location of the precinct. But it requires the unanimous vote
of the county board for that. Part 27 deletes an obsolete statute about
preparing for the 2000 census that was enacted in 1986. Part 28 looks
for a study of reducing the need for a second primary and asks the
committee to look at should we go to a plurality and get rid of it,
lower the 40% threshold, keep the 40% threshold but provide that a lower
margin might win if there's a substantial margin between like 35% and
the next person has 12% or the possiblity of only retaining second
primaries for certain major offices and just have plurality for others.
Part 29 clarifies some language on the state's boards duty to make sure
that ballots are clear and understandable by voters. Part 30 has the
effect of requiring paper ballots in the entire state effective in 2018.
The system that about 60 counties have now where we have optiscan
systems and basically provides that direct record electronic machines
will not be used after January 1 2018. Part 31 provides that the order
of parties on the ballot will be the party of the nominee for governor,
followed by other parties in alphabetical order. Part 32 eliminates what
colloquially is called straight party or straight ticket voting. Part 33
reduces the, eliminates the discretion of the county board of elections
to extend polling places under an hour, for an hour if they want to and
replaces it with the state being authorized to do that for delays in
open to the polling places or times where it might be closed due to
certain processes and allows them to extend it on a minute by minute
basis. If a polling places opens two hours early then it can extend it
two hours if there's a problem during the day. And it pushes that to the
state and you add an equal amount of time to the day. Part 34 makes some
changes to assistance to voters. And especially in assistance to voters
who've been adjudicated incompetent. Part 35 provides for an earlier
presidential primary if South Carolina has those before the 15th, has
its before the 15th day of March. North Caroline did have a separate
presidential primary once in 1976. Part 36 makes it clear that the state
board can add additional recognized presidential candidates to the
presidential primary even if the party chair did not send along their
name. Part 38 eliminates the political parties financing fund, the
judicial elections fund and the voter owned election fund. I would note
that the budget does also eliminate the judicial campaign financing.
Part 39 is a house passed bill allowing decedents, deceased voters of
state to vote for allows funeral homes and others to assist and
canceling voter registration of deceased persons. I think that's a
combination of two different house passed bills, 39.1 and 2. 41 calls
for a study on campaign finance electronic reporting. And I'm going to
let Erica discuss campaign finance until we get down to parts 45 and 49
that I will answer, that I will get back to please.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part 42 would raise the contribution limit from $4,000 to $5,000. Would
also conform North Carolina law to federal law with respect to
contributions from family. And would provide for a natural increase in
the contribution limit based off of the consumer price index every 2
years and publication of that greater amount. Part 43 would expand the
use of building funds for political parties. Currently they can be used
for headquarters buildings. The expansion would allow that money to be
used for the compensation for up to three personnel whose main duties
are administrative in nature. Part 44 would repeal via the stand by your
ad disclosure requirements. Part 45 would say that any member of the
board of elections could not serve more than two consecutive four year
terms. Part 47.</p>

DQBBBD\nWould tighten the lobbying, the laws on lobbyist bundling of
contributions currently they are not permitted to bundle multiple
contributions from multiple contributors this would make a clear that a
lobbyist could not take one contribution from anyone and deliver it to
any candidate. Part 48 would reveal the two articles on candidates’
specific communications that deal with television cable and radio ads as
well as ?? Neilgton Telephone Banks. Part 49…\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nPart
49 basically moves the law back prior to 2005 conforms to Federal Law if
you have under this proposal we will go back to pre 2005 if you have
moved you may go back to your polling place pick up a precinct transfer
form and take it to the correct polling place and go to regular ballot,
you may go directly to the correct polling place for where you moved
which can be looked up online and cast to provisional ballot there or
the Federal Law requires Counties to have a central location where you
can vote on election day if you moved which in every County really is
the board office. So, those who looking the alternatives you cannot vote
at random precinct which is also true if you haven’t moved if you
haven’t moved you have to vote in your correct precinct except off
course during early voting. Part 50…\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nPart 50 would
it change the definition of electioneering communication to have that
time period and the even number general election begin on September
15th.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nPart 51 eliminates the instant run off for
late occurring traditional vacancies so it will be determined by a
plurality as it was prior to about five years ago. Part 52 requires if
there are provisional ballots, if you have provisional ballots at a
polling place that there will be something written on the ballot to
indicate it’s a provisional ballot it doesn’t make it retrievable. In
one county last year, accidentally a whole bunch of provisional ballots
were fed into the tabulator and once they were in there it was no way to
know which were the provisional ballots in the ?? one, this will allow
us if that happens again for them to be pulled out because what they
were if they get counted centrally by the Board Of Elections.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nPart 53 would change the reporting cycle for the third quarter
of a political committee to require weekly reports. Part 54 would
establish a $500 threshold before a political committee had met the
definition which requires filing organizational reports and the
standardized reporting schedule applying. Part 55 would reestablish a
study to determine whether or not the contents and the timing of all
political committees or electioneering communications, and independent
expenditures should be similar in nature. Part 56 would reveal some of
the provisions regarding disclosure for media advertisements. Part 57
would study the elimination of the 48 hour report. Part 58 would
quantify the decision and take some of the ridge with respect to a
returning client privilege and redistricting communications. Part 59
would allow a political committee or a candidate campaign committee to
have one raffle per year. And Part 60 is the effective day and it’s
effective when it becomes law except this other what’s
provided.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nActually the operative parts of the bill
become effective January 1, 2014 unless there is another provision in
the bill what should number of sections do.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank
you very well done.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank you Mr. Chairman and thank
you staff clearly ?? I think everybody having had the opportunity to
read the photo voter ID. She is like that there is transition between
the passage of this bill and his full implementation in the 2016
election. There are plenty of opportunities for individuals to be
notified either directly through education or also at the time of 14th
election primary in general election they will, each of them will be
notified at their precincts when they go to vote that photo
identification will be required in the 2016 election. Mr. Chairman, I
think it is clearly before us and we can respond to any questions and
hopefully when they ask questions they can identify the sections that
they are coming from.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nAnd hopefully the page number
also. Let me do this I know we have some amendments, let’s give the
amendment setups so we can get those organized and ready, and be ready
to start debate here in about three or four minutes if we could. So, we
will just take a brief moment. I have a list of folks who will be

Technical deleting an extra word. Line 4 is cleaning up an issue with
the acceptable forms of ID for a photo ID, indicating that a military ID
card or a veterans ID card would no longer need to have an issuance or
expiration date in order to be acceptable. On the amendment itself,
lines  11 is to clean up an issue with the ability to challenge a voter
who did not present a photo ID. That photo ID would need to bear a
responsible resemblance of the voter that would be dispositively
determined at the poll on Election Day by the judges of elections. So,
it would not be an acceptable means of challenging the voter. On the
amendment itself, line 15 amending page 8 is to clarify that when
someone requests due to sickness or physical disability in the week
prior to the election a regular mail-in absentee ballot, that that
regular mail in absentee ballot can be delivered to the voter, the
voter’s near relative, or the verifiable legal guardian of that voter.
On the amendment line 19, which is amending page 11 of the bill, is to
clarify sight. On line 22 of the amendment, which is amending page 12 of
the bill, is to clarify that it would be unlawful for the owner,
manager, director, employee, or other person other than a voter’s near
relative or verifiable legal guardian when assisting with that regular
mail in absentee ballot to sign the application or certificate that is
required to be returned with that mail-in ballot. On the amendment
itself line 25, which is amending page 26 of the bill, is to clarify
that the additional 10 at large observers that could be in the polling
place. The list could be sent in by the political party chairs prior to
the one stop site and then amended to include different or additional
folks for Election Day. On the amendment line 31, which is amending page
31 of the PCS, is changing the effective date for the appeal of the
pre-registration program to September 1, 2013. On page 2 of the
amendment line 1, which is amending page 31 of the bill, is to clarify
that it would be unlawful for any person to be compensated based on the
number of forms submitted, in terms of voter registration forms, and it
does not matter if you are a government employee or not. On the
amendment line 5 page 2, which is amending page 38 of the bill, is to
make a technical correction to provide for the effective date of the
changes to the approval of the satellite voting places. On line 17 of
the amendment, which is amending page 44 of the bill, is to get the
proper term in place on line 42. Deleting, preparing, and substituting
marking. On the amendment line 20, which is amending page 47 of the
bill, is to make conforming change that goes with the repeal of the
contribution limit for judges for district and superior court which is
currently at a reduced amount of $1,000. That repeal is in the amendment
of page 2 lines 28 and 29. The amendment page 2 line 25 is technical in
nature to get an extra “the” out of a sentence. On the amendment page
37, which is amending page 50 line 31, is to insert the word multiple to
make it consistent with the other three subdivisions. The amendment page
2 line 40 is amending section 48 of the bill to repeal both the
television, cable, and radio ads for candidate-specific communications,
as well as the mass mailings and the telephone banks. The amendment page
3 line 1 is conforming to the repeal of the mass mailings and telephone
banks candidate specific communications and on page 3 of the amendment
line 4, which is amending page 51, is making a conforming change to make
the phraseology.</p>

53 of the bill and provides for a study of the reporting cycles not so
the amended PCS would no longer change the quarterly reporting in the
third quarter. The last change on page 3 line 13 of the amendment
changes the caption for part 58 to state that it's clarifying the scope
of chapter 132 and the article 17 of chapter 120 which are the public
record statues and legislative confidentiality. [speaker changes] Thank
you, Erica. Alright, the discussion, debate on the amendment. Senator
Stine. [speaker changes] Um, the provision at the bottom of page 1 of
the amendment, line 31 on page 31 eliminating the pre-registration and
13 rather than 15. I'm not as concerned what year you eliminate it, I
just want to know why we are eliminating an effort to try to help people
get registered to vote.[speaker changes]Senator Rucho. Yes. Jerry, would
you explain the provision? [speaker changes]I'm sorry, which one is it?
[speaker changes] Explain what the bill does? [speaker changes]No, the
amendment. [Speaker changes] The amendment changes the effective date.
So pre-registration of voters in high school will end September 1, 2013.
Those that who had previously been pre-registered as they turn 18, which
could be all the way through September 1st, 2015 will still be moved to
the regular voter rolls. [Speaker changes] Mr. Chairman? [Speaker
changes] Yes. [Speaker changes] My question is, people engage the state
when they get a driver's license. And that is a logical time for them to
register. There's no allegations of people voting before they are 18,
I'm just wondering why we're not helping people to participate in the
democratic process. [Speaker changes] He's wanting to know
why...[Speaker changes] Mic's on. [Speaker changes] You're right. The
driver...[Speaker changes] If I may, my son turned 18 January 30th.
Missed this last ballot. went through the school process and was
pre-registered and the like and it was very confusing as to when he was
supposed to do this. What this does is offer some clarity and some
certainty as to when that child or that young person is eligible to vote
and registers to vote, and that's what it's designed to do. [Speaker
changes] Follow up? [Speaker changes] Did your son not know that he was
17 on election day? [Speaker changes] If you would like my son to come
visit you. He did, but the clarity was the fact that it was confusing.
We got a letter from the board of elections which I actually responded
to, and I asked them to clarify it. It only made the situation more a
lot more complicated and complex, and wasn't understood, clearly
understood, and therefore this is a perfect opportunity when they turn
18 to vote to register. [Speaker changes] Other questions on the
amendment? [Speaker changes] Let me send forth, let me adjust the
amendment here. We need to change a number. Erica? [Speaker changes] On
the amendment itself, page 3 line 10 should read &quot;on page 54 line
16 through 36 by deleting those lines. [Speaker changes] Okay. Further
discussion. All those in favor of the amendment say &quot;Aye&quot;.

From ?? The used them on the bill on page 11, ?? 47,  by adding the
following immediately after the period. Delivered in person as used in
the previous sentence also includes delivering the ballot, to an
election official, at a one stop voting site, under Statute 163 227.2.
During any time, the side is open for voting.  The ballot should be kept
securely and delivered violation officials to the side of the counting
board of election office, for processing. ?? explains\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nMr. Chairman, some people do like the opportunity to complete
their ballots in the comfort of their own homes. But, at the same time,
they would like to actually go to the polling place, and basically
submit their ballot. So, what this does is, it essentially allows them
to default. That being said I ask Mr. Cohn, to further explain
them.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nAlright, this is similar to a number of other
statements. This provision here is similar to a number of other states
including Florida, where if you have a mail and absentee voting, rather
than mailing it back to the board of election, or delivering into the
board office, you can deliver to an early voting site, and turn it into
an election official there, during the early voting period.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nMr. President, either to send a clerk in or to just go in,
but,  In following the process that you're bringing forward, 1, Is
everyone eligible to use this absentee ballot, and then using the one
stored at the voting site as their depository? And 2, What types of
identification are required by the individual or the person? Is that
same person delivering that ballot to the one stored at the voting
site?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nMr. ?? First, your mail and absentee vote will
have to have the same standard as anything else. It is worked  out by ??
election. Before you apply when they received it, there are some changes
in this bill on, want to have on it. But the process of delivering it,
delivering the ballot to the... Anyone can mail it in. If you are
delivering it to the board of elections, which would also apply here,
can be delivered only by the voter, or the voter's near relatives or
legal guardian. Those are the people who could deliver it to an early
voting site as opposed to in person to the board of elections or mailing
it in.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nIf they were to bring that and to the early
voting site and place it into the machine, would that ballot not be read
as having voted that day?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThey are not placing in
the machine. They are delivering a ballot inside an envelope to the
early voting site, just as delivered to the board office. If you deliver
it to the board office, they hold it till the election day, when they
open the envelope and decide to tabulate Here they would just be
basically to be transmitting the sealed envelope to the board of
elections.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nI'm aware that what they are intended to
do. My question was the... Having ?? stated, Long time ago, in history,
it was valuable for an individual to get blank ballot they could
pre-mark for an individual and have the individual bring back ?? ballot
so that they could verify how the individual is voting. My question is,
if someone has received one of these at home and brings it to one of
these sites, is it readable in the machine as the same as their ballot
they would receive the same day?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nIf the election
official, the early voting site were to open the envelope, and put it
into the tabulator, Yes. But statute require it just to be delivered to
the board office, the official at the early voting site to keep it
securely and deliver it to the county board of elections for processing.
The earlier thing you were talking about is called chain
voting.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\n?? If they are doing that to stop that, they
need to stop that. That is illegal.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nExactly! We're
trying to help that along.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nAny other questions from
the committee? Okay, Second Amendment, all in favor say ?? Any opposes?
So passes.</p>

We have 118 v2. Senator Clark, tell us what this amendment does.
Everybody has this in front of them I don't think I have to read it to
them.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay mister chairman. Under the current bill if
an individual wants to do an absentee ballot they have to have two
individuals sign it for them. But what this does is allows you to have
your ballot attested to by a notary public. So that you may not want to
have your brother, your sister, your aunt, your uncle or whomever
validating your ballot for you. And if you like Mr. Cohen can read
through the amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right the law up until.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead Jerry.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry thank you
sir. The law up until four years ago required two witnesses. It was
changed to one. This committee substitute restores it to two in the viva
part of the bill. His amendment would say you could just have one rather
than two if the one was a notary public who signed, put their title and
fixed their notarial seal to the envelope so that that would be what he
is proposing.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Heiss.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is
there any limit to the number that a particular notary public could sign
off on?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] No I can answer that for him. What he think?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think mister chairman that this is a reasonable
alternative and I think it probably should be considered positively.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate on it, senator Brock.
 [SPEAKER CHANGES] Continue my bad attitude here, but I was just asking
senator Clark. If they cannot charge a fee, and I mean I really don't
think they could charge a fee, but could they refuse to sign it because
you may have a notary that works in a office or as a notary in their
place of business. And they have to provide this service for free.
You're gonna take their time from the workday to notarize all these
ballots and just take time away from them. I just think it might, would
a notary be able to refuse?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The answer is yes, they
could refuse if they do accept however they could not charge a fee. At
price.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay that's fine.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further questions on the amendment. All those in favor of the amendment
say aye. Any oppose no. So passes. We have the pcs befores as a amended.
Discussion from the committee. Senator Stein.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] You had
said in the preliminary remarks that you were comfortable staying as
long as I needed, I mean this is an extensive bill, it was 6 parts 14
pages and now it's 60 parts and 57 pages so I have a whole series of
questions on many provisions is that ok?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly,
go ahead.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chairman. The first week
of early voting last election about 900,000 people voted. Something like
85% of the state thinks early voting's a good thing and shouldn't be
shrunk. 75% have voted early at one point or another. Why are we
eliminating a week of early voting?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] We're what point
are you talking about, what page are you on now, what section? Just so
we can be clear.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Jerry can help me, what section
eliminates a week off of early voting? Page 37 part 25.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mister chairman. What we're trying to accomplish.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Please.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Senator Stein, what
we're trying to do is put some consistency into the process and allow
for the facilities to be similarly treated in one county as in being all
the counties. It does give still some good flexibility to the county
boards of election in selecting those. There's probably a savings in the
sense that by going from 17 to the 10 days you actually have a more
opportunity to open up more sites that would open more opportunity for
people to have access to voting during that period of time. And what it
does by having that consistency everyone has an equal access to voting.
It does not stop it leaves the county the choice of opening on a Sunday
or not opening on the Sunday. But when it was originally put forward
back in 1997 and senator Nesbit at that time you were a representative I
believe, and I had this early voting bill in place and I was one of the
cosponsors of that bill and it was designed to open up the opportunity
for access.</p>

It's been altered over the last number of years, maybe tainted in the
direction, but what this does is it sets it at an equal footing in every
one of the counties and that's going to treat everyone equally and
fairly.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank Mr. Chair.  If that's nine hundred
thousand people that need to vote another time and there's no guarantee
or no direction in here as to how many early voting sites to open up.
So, the more you backload the vote, the more you'll have on election
day, and I know, Senator Rucho you're an expert in electricity.  You
have peak load, which is the most expensive load, and that's gonna be
when most people are in demand, and election day, the more people you
push to election day, the more precincts your gonna have to create, the
more voting sites your going to have to have, which is more expensive on
a marginal basis than having more early vote.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nSenator Stein, I think probably you see a lot of the early
days in the seventeen day cycle probably not utilized as much - other
than maybe the first day when a lot of folks get excited and then it . .
. the peak is reduced -  but what this does is it gives access with the
same hours that will be treating every one of the sites in every one of
those counties the same way and there will be the possibility since
there is some savings in the time to open up additional sites, but that
will be at the discretion of the county boards of elections, and what
that does, is it gives more opportunity for people to vote; you don't
have to go across town if it's not in your neighborhood senator
Stein.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nSenator, one more comment on this.  If you
look at the chart, you'll see that voting is actually quite consistent
every day of early voting.  So if you take those seven days out of early
voting, you are going to have to move those people somewhere else.  The
likely result will be longer lines on election day which leads to my
next question Mr. Chair, which has to do with the elimination of
straight party ticketing - ticket voting.  There, North Carolina is one
of the most &quot;little d&quot; democratic states in the country in
that we elect more statewide offices than most any state in the nation.
So, on a presidential year, there's gonna be anywhere from fifteen to
sixteen offices, and even if in an off-year election there can be seven
to ten, that seven to ten times - seven to seventeen times longer for
each person to vote - my question to the sponsor is, the relationship
between substantially lengthening by a factor of ten the amount of time
it takes for people to vote early - half people vote early - I mean vote
straight ticket . . .\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThirty two.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nWe're trying to get the page number senator Stein.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nWhat's your page and section number of that please.  You have
the section number?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nPage forty three.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nSection thirty two is it Mr. Cohen?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThirty
two.  Yes sir.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThat eliminates straight party voting
which half the state uses, so for those half the people you're gonna
increase amount of time by a factor of ten to fifteen, what kind of
analysis have you done in terms of the impact on lines for people to
vote by shrinking early voting, and lengthening the amount of time it
takes for people to vote.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nWhat we wanted to try to
do, is be sure that all of the down ballots, races, a lot of the times
the judges that aren't included in the straight voting are included in
the process if someone is running for office they should be included in
that manner.  And also, there are a lot of other down ballots that are
non-partisan that get left off, and we want to try to be sure that the
voter who I have a lot of respect for is being very intelligent, very
knowledgeable, can come forward and handle that problem, and also, I
understand, talking with some of our staff, that we are the exception
rather than the rule; most states don't have the early, I mean the
straight ballot.  And, what we're trying to do is find that they've had
no problems, so, we see no reason why we can't conform with what a lot
of other states have done in the system.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank you.
My question was, is the effect on election administration.  What
analysis have you done in terms of the amount of time it's going to take
for people to vote with fewer days to vote.  What's the consequence
gonna be in terms of the length of lines for people to vote given that
you're increasing by a factor of ten, on average, the amount of time for
half of the people to vote.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nSenator Stein, we
believe that the early voting probably will have more sites available
that they would be able to have more opportunity in different locations,
which will spread out the votes - you don't have folks having to cross
town to get into the early sites - and secondly, we believe that other
states have had no problem with this, they've, I'm sure Georgia and some
of these other states vote every bit as much as . . .</p>

We do, and feel that that's not been a problem and we don't believe that
it will be a problem and we also believe that there is a very good
possibility that we'll have more pension paid to judges and to other
elections and other initiatives that may be dealing with non
partison.\nSpeaker changes: And let me just say that we also feel that
2014 will give us a good run to see how that works and then we can make
adjustments at that point to be ready for 16. ?? Next question?\nSpeaker
changes: just a comment on that before I...\nSpeaker changes:
Please\nSpeaker changes: Which is that in an off year election the
turnout is a fraction of what it is in a presidential election when you
have 70% of the voters voting in a presidential election versus 25-30%
in an off year election, I don't think it will give us any indication of
how it's working until 2016.\nSpeaker changes: Oh I'd have to disagree
with that, I think Senator Heiss could do some statistical analysis to
come up with a pretty good figure but next question.\nSpeaker changes:
Alright, statistical analysis question; This come- Data from the state
board of elections, just in the even year elections, the state
elections, last 6 of them, primary and general, there have been
approximately 30 million votes cast in North Carolina, and there have
been two instances of in-person voter fraud. What evidence of in person
voter fraud is compelling you to impose the ID requirement?\nSpeaker
changes: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Stein, I'm sure your
understanding of how society is today, you can't live in this society
with[out] identification; whether you go into buildings, whether you
cash checks, whether you pay your groceries with checks, whether you
want to get on an airplane - whatever it is - everyone has a form of
photo ID. This bill goes to it's full extent in allowing and helping
individuals that may not have it, especially since we've allowed the DMV
to take an active role in delivering and providing at no cost
indenti-photo identification so that they can be used in this manner.
There are a number of instances that we know about as individual basis -
I'm sure you've heard the same thing and I'm sure you pay close
attention to the fact that some folks have lost their opportunity to
vote because when they go to vote in an early vote, they were told that
they had already voted and for some reason that never seams to get
recorded or reported. So what we believe, the importance of the
electoral process is the fact that we're providing integrity and honesty
in the system and what that means is that that confidence level will be
instilled in the electoral process and therefore back in government and
that's something we should all be striving for.\nSpeaker changes: Just a
brief comment Mr. Cameron\nSpeaker changes: Please\nSpeaker changes: The
notion that everyone has of Photo ID is just wrong, there-um-our
society...\nSpeaker changes: Okay, alright, now we're not gonna tolerate
that! Um, clear the room, we're gonna sit here and act respectfully -
respectful of everyone, carry on Senator.\nSpeaker changes: Thank you,
and I ask the same of the audience too, to not interupt.\nSpeaker
changes: Thank you.\nSpeaker changes: The-the fact is that we have ID's,
we have banking accounts. There's more than a half a million adult North
Carolinian's who don't have a banking account, therefore they don't have
checks. There are, from again the state board of elections, I know we
like to have facts when we do our debate, there are more than 300,000
registered voters in North Carolina who do not have a driver's license;
185,000 of those actually voted in 2012, so that's a 185,000 people who
are going to be impacted by this requirement; a requirement which
the-the necessity of which is non-existent when you have two instances
of in person voter fraud, you said for some reason they're never
reported, I think there's a reason why they are never reported, because
it's myth. Two instances of in person voter fraud out of 30 million
votes cast and that doesn't even count the off year municipal elections,
I had to go to each county and I didn't have time to do that. The follow
up question on same day voter registration.\nSpeaker changes: Senator
Stein, not yet, we'll do this question then we'll let some other members
but let's let Senator ?? respond here...\nSpeaker changes: You know,
Senator Stein, you made a point that I believe is inaccurate. During the
in districting hearings, a fellow, when we were in Durham came up and
identified himself and said that I-he was at a poll and on three
occasions I think he said that he</p>

you alluded to. And we have a good phased in plan to give people an
opportunity that may not have an ID, an opportunity to have an ID for

question.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThe same day voter registration about a
million people took advantage of that in the last elections cycle.
People have very busy lives. Now, that they are no longer being
registered according to your bill when they get their driver license
there is gonna be whole group of young people those are the biggest
cohered of new registrants every year, it’s people who ageing and people
who move in. The people who ageing they are busy, they are maybe in
school one place or another working and they don’t think to get
registered to vote months in advance of the election. So, the same day
registration is an incredible service that the state offers and million
people to come in and get registered and vote that same day, “Why are
you taking that away from the people?”\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank you Mr.

by the post office to sign up for the draft, he also had the idea that
he needed to vote. So, I’m not sure that’s an issue that they are not
excited about knowing that the opportunities and they know what the
rules are to accomplish that and what was the other part of your
question please?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThe one million people who did it,
why are you taking this away from the next million?\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nWell, the problem that we found and what I believe exist is
the fact that a lot of boards of elections have a very hard time of
working their way through a system when someone comes up and registers
the vote and vote at the same time and there is no way and there is no
simple way to validate what we are trying to do is give the board of
elections an opportunity to do their job correctly validate those
individuals and be sure that the election is above the board.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nThank you, additional questions from committee. Okay, I think
I will take some from the audience. Let’s start our comments, comments
not question. Comments, let see Alison Rigs please come up and you have
two minutes thank you for coming today.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank you.
My name is Alison Rigs and first I would like to comment on what at
first introducing this bill at this late day that does this much damage,
the damage to democracy in the state from this is unacceptable. This
bill is voter suppression and it’s very worst, you are making North
Carolina a national laughing stock and you should be ashamed. This bill
is a naked attempt to predetermine election outcomes by keeping people
from voting. This bill steals from North Carolinians opportunities to
vote that you know or disproportionately use by voters of color and low
income voters. This bill as a whole can only be interpreted as one thing
a cynical ploy to make it harder for certain people to vote. Those are
poor people, people of color, elderly people and young people. This bill
disrespects and violates state and Federal constitutional and statutory
protections of the four of the franchise. North Carolinians won’t stand
for this. This bill erases the years of progress we have made and
improving election administration making friendlier the election
experience for voters and encouraging civic participation. North
Carolinians won’t stand for this voters love same day registration they
love early voting. This bill encourages bullying at the ballot box, you
are creating a situation in which polling places will now be a free for
all and the voters who are least likely to be able to stand that
bullying are gonna be subject to it even more. This bill does not revise
and reform 30 years of election. How many of these reforms and acted
since 2000. What it does is it takes away the opportunities that you
have…\n[0:04:59.7]\n[End of file…]</p>

The North Carolinians in the past that have been beneficial, it takes
those away and it disrespects the right to vote. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank
you. Is it Brent Lawrence, is that right? Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, sir. My name is Brent Lawrence, I'm with the North Carolina Center
of Voter Verification. As preposed we have a lot of strong concerns
about this bill and the impact it'd have on voting and civic engagement
in North Carolina, particular concern is provision in the new version
that allow college ID's to be used in public universities in voting
under the voting ID portion of this bill. We think that's a bad move
because those are public ID's issued by public institutions. The second
thing we're really concerned about is the short member early voting. As
we've heard, over 2.5 million voters used it last year. That's about 56%
of voters. It's a widely popular program of cross party lines, it's not
a partisan issue. So we're concerned about that and the impact it might
have on longer lines on election day, confusion at the polls, and all
that stuff. We're also concerned about the emulsion?? registration,
again another tool that can be used to improve civic participation among
citizens, and in preregistration, we're intrigued about that design to
get 16 to 17 year old kids interested in civics and interested in
politics and government and engage in the process at a young age. I
think that's a great thing and all children and all students should be
taught civics and engage as early as possible. Finally, those are our
strongest concerns and there's other issues in there that are
concerning, but we hope the final version of this bill will ultimately
address some of these concerns and not do such detrimental damage to
voting participation in North Carolina. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you for your comments. Vicky Boyer? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank
you, sir, for giving the public an opportunity to speak today. In our
country, everyone is considered innocent until proven guilty. Voter ID
requirements say everyone is guilty unless they can prove themselves
innocent. Voter ID punishes all the innocent even when one person has
not yet committed a crime. We do not have a constitutional right to buy
Sudafed on a plane or drive a car, but we do have a constitutional
guaranteed right to vote. American's don't think of themselves as
philosophers, but we're blessed to live in the first nation state
founded upon an idea; a concept. According to the Declaration of
Independence, the idea of America, is that legitimate governments derive
their just powers from the consent of the governed. That consent is
gained through the process of voting and voting has become a sacred
American right. It says government is accountable to the people. ID
requirements say people are accountable to the government. Voter ID says
each of us must have the consent of the government in order to
participate in America's greatest ritual and unless you're going to make
all driver's license's' available for free, we have to pay for it to
boot. This requirement changes the very nature of the American compact.
It replaces voters in charge of government and puts government in charge
of voters. It allows for a future when one group an hour can limit
voters to those that will keep that group in power. No good American
wants to see that and that being said, this bill presented is not about
voter protection, but voter prevention. Voter ID diminishes our sacred
American pact. Voter ID diminishes our democracy, it is un-American. It
is wrong, this bill is bad for North Carolina. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you. Alright, next we have Jordan Delotch, is that
correct? Please, Jordan, come forward. Thank you for coming today.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, sir, as he said, my name is Jordan Delotch.
Im a citizen of Carrie and I'm currently a student at Duke. I'm here to
speak about how this bill would affect students in particular. For
example, freshmen moving in. They are going to be very excited to vote.
They are just turning 18, this is their first opportunity to vote, but
their not necessarily going to be familiar with the rules of the states.
They're not necessarily going to be excited to vote unless someone
notifies them that, yes, they have to get this registration done as soon
as possible. So, I've done a lot of work to help get people out to vote.</p>

And yet I know that this voter ID bill would prevent yet another
obstacle that is-just isn't necessary for people to deal with, not just
students but anyone shouldn't have to deal with getting a photo ID when
there just are not cases of in person voter fraud to be reported. The
problem with this bill is that it's a solution is search of a problem
and even if it does head off any potential in person voter fraud, the
damage that it does in terms of preventing people from voting is just so
much greater that its a solution that creates more problems. So those
are the main reasons why I am against this bill, thank you for your
time.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jordan, thank you for coming, Brian... Im gonna
destroy it Brian I'm sorry, Schneiderwynn I've got a bad last
name...\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, it's Schneiderwynn.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you Brian for coming today.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks for
having me, appreciate it. For the last nine years I've been a government
teacher at ?? High School just a couple miles up the road. I wanna thank
you guys also for the bill last couple of hours ago that was passed, I
promise I'm gonna work a lot harder now and thank you for realizing that
in my time when I earned my masters degree I became a terrible teacher.
Also, in my time at Millburg, I was able to-I've been able to be this
sponsor of a voter registration drive, at which point I've registered
approximately 2000 students and I gotta tell you contrary to the bill of
sponsor this ain't rocket science. Pretty simple process, I go to the
students classroom, I have a list of students who are eligible to
register, I ask them if they'd like to, and in about 5 minutes they fill
out the voter registration, at which point I double check it, I then
send it on to Women Believe Voters who also double checks it and away we
go. So I promise you that voter registration, just like Senator Stein
said, among voters is not an issue, the registration process itself I
don't see fraud, you know assuming that we're not all hopping into a
Deloreon and traveling 90 years back to Chicago, I don't see that also
as being an issue. What the real issue is voter apathy, you know Senator
Stein mentioned that we're up to 70% of people voting during the - if I
could get your attention please- thank you thank you, in the last two
presidential elections we've been lucky enough - yeah, over here, we've
been lucky enough to have 70% of people voting but statistically in the
last two decades it's been about 50% so I urge you guys instead of
asking what can we do to make even less people are voting we should be
asking ourselves the opposite right. And especially for youth, this is a
big, you know big issue making a big issue making it very hard for
people in urban areas to vote. Finally I'm gonna leave you with this,
over the last few years I've had the pleasure of telling my students
that this is a government of the people for the people and by the people
and if this bill passes I'm gonna have a little bit harder time looking
my students in the eye and telling that same thing.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You for coming. Okay, Alison Green. Next.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
afternoon and thanks for giving me this opportunity my name is Alison
Green I'm a native of Durham County and a resident of Durham County but
I'm a lecturer in the department of sociology and anthropology at North
Carolina State University. I was raised to life of civic participation
by my elderly mother who was a leader in the League Of Women Voters and
other organizations, and it became a hobby of mine to register voters as
soon as I was an adult. Over the course of my adult life I've registered
hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of voters, and those were voters
who registered as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I'm
extremely proud of this and it continues to be one of my favorite things
to do. This bill harms our democracy because it's going to restrict
participation in North Carolina elections. It purports to solve a
problem of voter fraud that by every scientific measure does not exist.
Okay. It will reduce participation in our elections by elderly people,
college students, disabled veterans and the working poor. We've heard
this already but I personally know people in each of these categories,
we've heard the statistics, we've also heard anecdotes. Every election
season I walk my precinct, knock on doors, and register voters, wait in
front of the grocery store, I am not being a partisan person I am being
a participant in our democracy. Early voting has been a great boom to
our state by allowing people with limited transportation and long
working hours to cast their votes. In my precinct this is a very big
deal.</p>

It means a lot of people who couldn't vote otherwise get a chance to
vote. Many elderly and disabled people I encounter lack current state
identifications and weren't able to get them even though they have been
voting for years. In the 2011 November elections I helped a disabled
veteran in my precinct register and vote in the same day. He had no
transportation, he could barely walk, he had not had the opportunity
before I knocked on his door. He would not have been able to vote if
this law was in place. So...\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much, I
believe your time has expired. Susan, I am not going attempt the last
name, please...\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have owned a home in Durham
(spelling?) since 1984 and I would like to remind you, regarding voter
ID, that the voter ID law in Pennsylvania was successfully challenged
and postponed when the judge found that he could not allow the law to go
through if even one voter was disenfranchised by the law. And so what I
am simply going to suggest to you is that, contrary to what you seem to
think, you people who, and I am one of you, who take planes so easily,
who have passports, who travel, who have drivers licenses... there are
many, many, many voters who have exactly the same right to vote in this
state, but who would be disenfranchised or who would have to pay money
to travel. To be able, some kind of money, some kind of getting help
from friends, something that would be, in essence, a poll tax, in order
to procure this voter ID. Particularly the odd requirement that is
student photo ID would not be included as a valid form of ID. I thank
you very much for your attention.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Let me
make an announcement. I believe everyone here is probably for the
finance committee meeting. We are going to postpone that and do it on
the floor, so... Next speaker, Rob Stevens please.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not Rob Stevens, I'm Bob Hall. Rob is yielding his time to
me.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you representing Democratic party? Is that
correct?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, the Democracy North Carolina, actually
one of the provisions that we helped sponsor is the preregistration that
you're gonna eliminate. That actually helps Republican voters, new,
young Republican voters. Thirty percent of the young people coming in
are Republicans, thirty percent are Democrats. So actually it's helping
equalize the plain. I will say that it's really sad you are trying to
jam so many of these provisions in here at the 11th hour. Rob do you
want to? ... Truly I'm just sad that you all feel obliged to jam this
kind of thing through. People that have tried to defend voting rights
and expand voting participation in this country have withstood water
hoses and been beaten and gone through lots, and you're building your
legacy here today as you put these measures forward, and so I just don't
think its even going to help me to try to explain to you what the damage
is. So, good luck to you...\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Next, Jamie
Phillips. Welcome.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I am Jamie Phillips. I
am here on behalf of the North Carolina NAACP and Reverend Doctor
William J. Barber, president. I want to point out, as every single
person before me has, that these changes to voting laws are impacting
specific groups of people. The fewer young people and minorities who
vote, the better, it seems in your minds. We get it, noone is being
fooled. Shouldn't a Democracy ensure elections are free, fair and
accessible to make...</p>

Sure, every citizen has a say. It is obvious to many North Carolinians
including people who have voted for you in this room that this bill has
been specifically crafted to make participation disproportionately
harder for certain voters, specifically seniors. of registered North
Carolina voters who lack ID nearly 25% are seniors over the age of 65.
even though they make up only 13% of the states population. seniors are
also hard hit by provisions making it more difficult to add satellite
voting sites to accommodate seniors and voters with disabilities. The
youth: in a sad move to restrict the youth participation in our
democracy, this bill specifically bans college student IDs from being
used for voting, eliminates free registration for 16 and 17 year olds,
and eliminates the requirements for high school voter registration
drives we should be encouraging the civic participation of young people,
not blocking it. and finally the most blatant and harmful impact of
these changes are in voters of color. 31% of registered north carolinian
voters who don't have photo id are african american. despite comprising
just 22% of the state's population, the bill also bans out african
americans, despite comprising just 22% of the state's population. This
bill also bans out precinct provisional ballot, striking the votes of
people who move, making it much easier to challenge voters eligibility
and create an intimidating presence at the polls all we ask is for your
conscience and goodwill to overcome your political interests. thank
you.\n[speaker changes]\nThank you, last we have Joshua Vincent please
welcome\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nThank you. I want to ask everyone who
opposed this bill to please stand with me in solidarity as i address the
committee. As the state coordinator for civic engagement for multiple
follow ??? and partisan turnout campaigns, I say demonstratively that we
do not need this bill. How dare we discourage our youth from exercising
our right as citizens to contribute to the electoral process by
restricting their ability to register and vote early. Further there's no
evidence of an issue of fraudulent voting in the state with signature ??
attached to our in person voting process. Also, there's no need to
confuse the citizens of this great state by adding loopholes and
prohibitive costs to our constitutionally guaranteed right to free and
fair education. senators, some of you appear to be drunk with power. why
are you so scared of the people? why are you so scared of people voting?
Maybe you've seen that less than 20% of north carolina supports your
extremist agenda. maybe you've seen that the people of north carolina
overwhelmingly support the moral Monday demonstrators who by the
hundreds are engaging in civil disobedience. people you have called
outsiders who you sit here and attempt to disenfranchise in front of our
eyes and our ears. you know that your extreme right wing agenda wont
last long you know that the people behind me, the true moral majority,
the black, white, asian, latino of all races old and young from all
socio-economic and religious backgrounds will not stand for this type of
race based fear mongering fundamentalists longing for the days when
black and brown people were in bondage and women were still uneducated
and in the kitchen. The people here have spoken, and they are with the
demonstrators in the streets and not with the regressive and deceitful
legislative practice taking place here today.\n[speaker changes]\nthank
you very much. whoever claps you can remove from the room. now, from the
committee senator Nesbith\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nIf i could, three or four
questions, I'm sorry I didn't do it a whole ago\n[speaker changes]\noh
that's...\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nI thought you were going to somebody else,
I didn't know\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nnow we wanted the public to have their
say\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nI got you. general questions i guess for staff,
that I'm just interested in. When we do this already voting, we're going
to create lines and i know there was a provision about when we close the
polls, but if we say that the polls have to close at a certain time and
you have 500 people in line, do they get to vote?\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES]\nthe answer is yes, both early voting and election day anyone
in line at the time the polls close are allowed to vote, regardless of
how long that takes.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]\nand on the question of limiting
early voting to 1:00...</p>

Sunday. Somebody, senator Nesbeth I believe. Last day is a Saturday at 1
o'clock, serve at 5.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it's that way now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can somebody explain why on the last day when you got
the crunch for early voting we would want to close four hours earlier,
has that caused a problem somewhere?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] About 30
counties in 2012 stayed open past 1 o'clock, about half 'til 3 and about
half 'til 5. I do know that a number of counties reported that when the
voting ended at 7 or 8 o'clock in a number of those counties, even 9,
that they had some trouble turning around all the lists to be available
to the precinct judges for election voting by the next morning, so some
counties did report some practical problems. In the last election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Nesbit, senator Nesbit excuse
me. The logistics of carrying that load is what we're looking at to try
to help the board of elections to be able to be prepared for the
onslaught come election day. So we're trying to give them some ability
to meet that demand.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Next question senator Nesbit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chairman, yes sir and I appreciate
this. These are really not hard questions for you, they will get a
little harder probably. The section 11 authorizes, now I think we have
two poll observers from each party. All the sudden we're gonna appoint
10 more from each party? What in the world are we doing?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Go ahead, senator Rucha.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister
chairman. When you have those poll workers in what was a problem is
trying to find that someone wasn't able to visit or be at their
location. What these at large poll workers, poll observers do is
actually are able to on a large basis fill in the slots so that
individual can be there. If someone was assigned to that election
precinct or poll is not able to attend. Apparently you have to sign up
to be, identify there. This poll worker on an at large basis will be
allowed to fill in and represent their organization appropriately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I guess this would be for Jerry, does the bill
provide that only two at a time will be allowed to work a poll?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me read the appropriation again, hang on a second
here. On page 26 lines 32.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] That they work and poll
and when you read the.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I'm reading that. On page
26 line 32 and 33 all those here 10 at large it states that in addition
to the two precinct designated of one of those 10 at large observers may
be at any one polling place, so would allow at any one polling place one
more, making 3. You follow.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that it?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] So I admitted to where you wouldn't
have the 6, 3 from each party at a time in there I guess.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That's correct.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I say that because when
you read the analysis, and I think it's true on election day. It really
goes quite extensively in the how you go to allow them to have acces and
they gotta be within hearing distance and they can get, they can go
anywhere in the poll that they want to. And I just say to you all, that
has the potential to getting out of hand. For both parties. When people
can run around the polling place and do mischief so. I would suggest to
you maybe it, look at that and anything you can do to tighten that up I
would certainly be for it. I want them to be able to observe and I want
them to be able to watch everybody, make sure everybody's doing the
right thing. But I don't want them intimidating people that are trying
to vote and I don't want them intimidating poll workers that are trying
to do their job or interfering with them.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes we
agree with you senator, we'll take a look at that.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I believe there is some remedy as to, the judge of that area is
still in charge, and you would hope that nobody sends a poll observer,
not a worker, the poll observer into an area that's gonna be disrupted.
They're there just to monitor. And I think it's pretty clear as to what
behavior is necessary for them to do their job and yet not be impeded in
doing so.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] When I read it, it looked to me like it was
balanced the other way. In other words if the judge does tell somebody
they're done, then that judge is gonna be scrutinized and held
accountable and blah blah blah. But I'm just saying.</p>

Might want to look at the language because I want them to be 00:00:02
polling place. That’s what you need to be able to do.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next question, another question. Okay.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Moving the
presidential primary I’m assuming you would not move the other primaries
so then you would have two primaries? How large is that unfunded
mandate. Are you funding that for the counties?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt is having looked at South Carolina and elsewhere, there
is sufficient resources by having a presidential preference pole
occurring within U.S. state at that appropriate time that the resources
are generated because of all the activity that exists because of that. I
think South Caroline, if I’m not mistaken Senator Brock actually showed
some increase revenues because of that activity. You also give the
people of the state an opportunity to have a say in a presidential
election that has meaning, or presidential primary has meaning rather
than waiting until May where it often doesn’t.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me
let Jerry chime in here.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under the North Carolina
election law, counties are responsible for most election expenditures
other than some state canvassing and training. The direct costs of most
of the separate presidential primary would be paid by the
counties.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next question senator Nesbitt.\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you [?? 01:45] I think what I heard was yes it’s an
unfunded mandate.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not quite in those terms but I
believe you’re correct ultimately.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could someone kind
of explain to me these weakened disclosure requirement on independent
expenditure committees. I thought we wanted to go the other direction
and have disclosures to who these people were. Have a drop in the box.
But [?? 02:11] it goes the other way. Maybe we can ask staff. There are
two or three places in here where it does that. If they don’t know, I’ll
wait and ask it later when I can find it but I can’t.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which part of the bill Senator Nesbitt?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not sure
exactly where it is in the bill but there’s language in here somewhere
that talks about not having to disclose who it is that’s doing direct
candidate, I think it’s called direct candidate expenditures, or
electioneering communications.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe Senator
Nesbitt is referring to part 56. There’s repealing the requirement that
for electioneering communications and independent expenditures that they
no longer would have to have the disclosure of the names of individuals
or persons making the five largest donations to the sponsor of that
electioneering communication or independent expenditure. Page 56 of the
bill.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why would we want to do that Mr. Chair? The
question is why would we want to have less disclosure about independent
expenditures as opposed to more? On both sides I mean that cuts both
ways.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] You answer that. Page 56, what section was
it.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 56.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 56 I’m
sorry. What page number was that? Okay yeah.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] I see
your name there Senator Rucho as a defendant.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chairman and Senator Nesbitt. The laws have gotten so confusing
as far as election laws that what this tried to do is simplify it,
clarified it and in essence get rid of any possible criminalization that
occurs because of the confusion in the gray area of the law and what
this did is it tried to eliminate that and simplify it so that every
candidate can understand what’s expected them and the areas that they
might run into problems. That’s the purpose behind why it has been
clarified and simplified.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman it’s pretty
clear when you say you don’t have to tell anybody who gave you the
money. I guess that’s clarifying.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t believe it
says this.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re striking out subsection 7: The

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Striking that out.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] The provision
that’s being discussed is a provision that is required in media
advertisement that would require the media ad to actually contain the
information about the five largest donors with respect to an
electioneering communication or an independent expenditure. Senator
Nesbitt is correct, that requirement would be being struck by the
PCS.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] For the media section correct?\n[SPEAKER
CHANGES] For the media section only.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] But the
reporting section they would still have it correct?\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. It
just won’t be on your TV screen, just your picture.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask this of staff. I’m not sure where I’m going, I just read this
and it looks peculiar to me. Some of your independent expenditure
committees don’t have to report who gave them the money. That may be
federal and it may not apply to this but somebody please explain to me
what we’re doing because it looks to me like you’re taking away the
right of the public to know who the people are putting the money
up.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please Erica.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll try. With
respect to electioneering communications and independent expenditures,
if the donor is making the donation for the purpose of furthering an
electioneering communication or an independent expenditure, the
information on the donor should be reported to the state board of
elections. That is not being altered by this provision. The provision is
only altering the requirement that the five largest donors be disclosed
in the media ad\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] That
makes it a little better Mr. Chairman but I still say, for your average
person out there that receives an ad, if you put down there paid for by
the Republican party, paid for by the candidate, paid for by the
Democrat party, people understand that. If you say paid for by the
Citizens for Good Government, they have no earthly idea who’s sending
that ad to them. I think there’s a purpose for having it on there so
that people get a gist of who this crowd is, whoever it may be on my
side or yours. I think I would ask you to look at that provision and
think about it a little bit because I hadn’t been [honorous? 02:35] that
I know of. I hadn’t had a complaint yet from anybody having to list
that. If they got to be listed. The problem is the people getting the
communication aren’t going to go look up the election records to see who
gave the money. That’s not the purpose of it. The purpose of it is so
they know when they’re getting the ad, who said it.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sure they’ll decide Senator Nesbitt will make them aware of who paid
for the ad ultimately. Senator Rucho.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have no
further comment on that.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other committee
questions? Okay Senator Rucho.\n[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman
and members of the committee. The lot of the discussion was talking
about the voter ID and under the guise that there was no problem or not
something that is necessary. Bottom line is we’re the last southeastern
state that would be introducing this photo ID. All the others have done.
None of them have had the situation where they’ve had a decline in voter
turnout and actually some of them have actually shown an increase
because people have confidence in the fact that everybody only votes
once and their vote matters and what that means is that you’ve
established integrity into the electoral process. There has been a lot
of discussion about this early on. I think Mr. Chairman, four or five
hours in the house, I think Representative Lewis talked about a lot of
these issues that were discussed in length and had a lot of public
comment. This is not something that has been put on people at the very
last bit. We talked about government valid ID’s. Those are ones that we
can have confidence in and everyone can have confidence in. Your college
IDs, whether they be in the university system in the state of North
Carolina or private there’s inconsistency throughout the entire system
with the college IDs. It’s felt that to be valid and people to have
confidence in, you want a uniform way of producing them and that’s why
the list is before you as to what constitutes valid ID. There was a
discussion earlier about the fact that senior citizens and/or disabled
individuals have been put upon by this bill and it’s totally erroneous
because of the fact that there has been allotted …</p>

Discussion with staff and the like, with a lot of people in the
disability rights groups. And they were appreciative of the fact
especially nursing homes and the like, that we accommodated a lot of
their language in the base of this bill and have alleviated most of
their concerns. Mister chairman with that being said I would hope that
we could pass this bill and  reestablish a level of integrity and
confidence in the electoral system and I urge the members to vote for
it.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator brought.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
mister chairman, an appropriate time way to move favorable report to
propose committee substitute is amended.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
mister prompt, I'm gonna hold that a minute. Senator Stein.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. I have a question mister chair, this is a voluminous
bill. The fact that the house is debated it, this is the first time the
senate has debated any of these provisions so I think we're. Let's not
overstate the amount of processes this bill has received. Do take the
opportunity to ask question. Part 38 on page 46 repealing the judicial
elections fund. We all received a letter from the entire court well
scratch that. 14 of the 15 judges on the court of appeals, bipartisan
group imploring us to maintain the judicial elections fund. They, judges
have to be impartial and people who historically give to judicial races
tend to be those parties that are before the judges and I don't think
that it necessarily impairs the independence of the judiciary, although
there are cases in other states notably West Virginia where that has
been. The supreme court has had that happen. Why are we clouding the
independence and integrity of our state judiciary by eliminating this
important advancement at elections?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ruchin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chairman, senator Stein. You know as
well as I one of the hardest parts of campaigning is going out and
soliciting campaign contributions. When you get something from somebody
it doesn't mean that your vote is compromised, you have people that are
concerned about issues that you may be concerned about and that's why
they help you. In this case what we're looking at is not having
government interceding or interfering in the process of the electoral
process of judges, and as long as we maintain that process we believe
that the government shouldn't be using that kind of taxpayers' money for
folks they may or may not want bought. So we feel it is a better way of
putting this forward. I wouldn't expect any knowing that soliciting
campaign contributions being the hardest part of the election campaign,
you would expect the judges to be not very interested in having that and
so therefore. That's probably why they woulnd't have, they would have
said we'd rather keep the money coming so we don't have to work hard at
it.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? Follow up.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] With
staff and am I right that the judicial candidates have to raise a
certain amount of money from a certain number of voters in order to
qualify for these funds?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry senator could you
repeat the question.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] For judges to qualify for the
judicial funds, do they not have to raise a certain amount of money from
a certain number of contributors in order to get that money.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] My understanding is that's correct. I would note that the
judicial campaign financing was also repealed in the budget that's up
for a vote in the senate today.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can vote against
that as well.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nasmeth.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, just to comment on the bill. I am, I would
feel remiss if I didn't make the statement. In the committee cuz we
still got time to maybe fix it by giving directives in there. You're
gonna have a situation with this bill where you've had people who have
voted all their lives that are gonna show up to polling place and not
have what they need to vote. That is outrageous, I mean they're. When
they have that track record of voting and they're regular people and
they live in a rural community and they're there, there ought to be a
provision in here for people who have, are known to everybody in there,
be able to vote. I just raise that because that's gonna happen on your
side just as much as it'll happen on ours. Second thing is, restricting
early voting is gonna cause a problem. The first thing that happened
after we got early voting enacted, was that the local boards, we had
actually put a provision in that said that the satellite sites would be
agreed on unanimously. No board could agree on anything unanimously on
purpose. And it.</p>

<p id="110:00">
.... A way to block all the satellite sites.  We had to come back down
here and pass another bill and you may remember it where we said if they
can agree, then the state board will make the decision trying to keep
oversight and balance in it but to get some sites out there. And if they
do that again and don't open enough sites out there you gone create
lines and this has been done.  You're talking about we're the last state
in the Southeast to do voter ID. we're about the last state in the
Southeast to create voter lines. This is exactly what they did in Texas,
where they wouldn't open... I mean Florida... where they wouldn't open
another site, they wouldn't open enough sites and they had people lined
up around buildings. And I am concerned that that's is going to occur
again. And that will hurt your voters as much as it will hurt our
voters. It's just a bad deal and if you can figure out some way to tell
them to put enough polling places out there. I would appreciate it.
Because I don't think they will unless we tell them to. And I'm not sure
how to tell them. And those lines are, its the most insidious thing in
the voting process and it's what brought about early voting. We were
getting down to where on election day we'd have two and three hour lines
and people would drive in the parking lot and just turn around and drive
back out. They weren't gone stand there that long. And its our
responsibility to make sure that voting is not a two hour burden on
somebody. They aught to be able to go in and vote and do the civic duty
and leave and it not be an ordeal for them. So I would ask you, based on
what I just told you, if you can to try to fix the problem of somebody
on voter id be able to participate and most of all to make sure we don't
have this problem of them not setting up enough satellite sites in order
to handle the flow of the people, so that we don't have lines.\nSpeaker
Changes - Senator Nesbitt. I think that every one of the Boards of
Elections for each of the counties fully understand. I know, in my
county knows how many folks are gonna estimate and to  make sure that we
have sufficient polling locations opened up both on election day and on
early voting.  Their goal is to make their operation run as smoothly as
possible. I'm not sure we should be dictating to them and telling them
to do this. Their goal is to get that election process done in a timely
and effective manner. The original purpose of the early voting was to
accommodate the fact that this society has changed where a lot of folks
had a lot of time today and with our busy society going from one
location to the other and doing things. That's why early voting was put
out there, at least in my way of thinking, Senator Nesbitt. And I see
that as a good step. I see that there were steps taking that have abused
it for part gamesmanship and partisan advantage. And what this does is
it levels the playing field. Every county will follow the same rules and
everyone will be given the same opportunity to vote and that is what
this is about.\nSpeaker Changes\nSenator Meredith\nSpeaker
Changes\nThank you Mr. Chairman. I had a question. Senator Ruto. Senator
Nesbitt brought up a point about the people coming to the polls and
having issues.  In 2014 does the bill not state, that we will
just\nSpeaker Changes\nThat's a great question.\nSpeaker
Changes\nSenator Meridith\nSpeaker Changes\nThis is a phased in
approach. During the primary and the general election of 14, the
individuals that come to vote will one, they will say... well I got my
ID and... that's great, well you don't need it, but you'll happen to
need that in the 2016 election cycle and so there's gonna be an
opportunity for the ones that are likely to vote to be there plus a lot
of other information shared so that everyone understands that they've
had a period to adjust a phased in or transition period to know that on
the 16th everyone will know that that is a requirement and. We used to
vote one day, Senator Nesbitt, before we started early voting. We
survived it. I don't know about in your county, but in my county there
are 2 and 3 and 4 hours of waiting at early voting lines and people will
either stay there or they won't stay there. Or they will find another
suitable time. We've given them a lot of other opportunities to practice
their right of voting and this will do the same thing but probably in a
more efficient manner.\nSpeaker Changes -\nThank you Senator Ruto.  I
didn't hear fair and legal one time. Senator Brock moves that we vote to
approve the PCS as amended with, rolled into a new PCS with any
corrections for alphabetical errors or grammatical errors made and
unfavorable to the original. All in Favor say I\nSpeaker
