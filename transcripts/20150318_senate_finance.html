The Robison and guest Sherry Burg from Charlotte, Senator ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that’s all the pledges we have and our Sergeant-At-Arms and
staff who always do a good job, there they are, their names are not out
here but we appreciate their good work. And Senator Rucho you are up on
the update.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the Finance Committee; we have the
House Bill 41 before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me Senator; we have motion for the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I make that motion Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The PCS has adopted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and not for discussion, House Bill 41 is the same as we passed
on the Revenue Laws, what’s the number of that bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 19.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
19, it’s identical to Senate Bill 19 we have had a discussion; we voted
on it and did everything. We felt that the house version make some
corrections that we can live with so we are going to move forward on 41,
the PCS includes the revenue laws decision on the IRRC and ladies and
gentlemen to the Senate that IRC is a critical piece of legislation
people who are waiting for the rules to be able to pay their taxes and
it’s essential that we do this. So what we are trying to offer is Senate
and the House an opportunity to vote on a clear IRC Bill along with
something they have already passed which is the House Bill 41. So that
is the PCS before you, you have voted on the original House Bill 41 and
you have voted on the IRC and that includes our staff Mr. Chairman
explain the IRC as what we got in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The staff would stipulate on the PCS please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. So as Senator Rucho said this PCS has two components one being the
IRC update and one being the revenue laws technical changes both of
which this committee and the body passed in virtually identical format.
So just to refresh your recollection on the IRC update which is the
first part of this bill, it is identical to what the Senate passed and
it decouples from the five items that we are discuss the only thing that
it conforms to is that $250 teacher expense deduction. So it decouples
from the enhanced section 179 expensing the exclusion from income
forgiveness of debt on principle residents, the mortgage insurance
deduction, the tuition expense deduction, and the exclusion from income
for the distributions from an IRA to a charity, and that’s CP. And then
the second part of the bill is itself ___[03:15] the same as the
technical changes that we see in Senate Bill 19 that this body has
already passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have heard the explanations, are there further questions? Senator
Stein is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, a question for staff, if a home owner owes
$200,000 on their home but its upside-down and the mortgage lender
concludes that it’s in their interest or their investor’s interest to
refinance that loan to reflect it’s market value to increase the
likelihood that they will get paid and they reduce the principle to
100,000 so that the home owner now pays on the smaller mortgage. How
much would that person have to pay in cash taxes if we decouple on the
mortgage interest premium’s interest?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The tax rate times the 100,000 which is the amount of that for given
which for 2014 tax rate would have been 5.8% so 5,800.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, actually one follow up question—did the House Bill 41 include this
provision when it came over from the House?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
41 was the revenue laws revision not the IRC, they are two separate,
Revenue Law something was a technical corrections on revenue law, am I
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir. The House changes to the IRC…

  Senate the House PCS to Senate bill twenty which is in conference
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So do the house bill forty one when it came over from the house did it
include this provision?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If your referring to the house version of the RC update that as Cindy
said is in Senate bill twenty which is in conference and that bill the
House version did conform to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So Miss Stein, Senate bill twenty was the gas tax and the IRC it&#39;s
bogged down. All right the IRC needs to be out of here as soon as
possible this is a vehicle that allows us to support what was the
revenue law technical corrections plus the IRC clean version that we
passed out of the Senate. And so that&#39;s the combination for both of
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One final comment Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House saw fit to take out this mortgage interest rate premiums
because they recognize that a person who&#39;s struggling gets a
mortgage reduction in their debt form two hundred to one hundred so they
can stay in their home. That was a paper transaction that has no cash to
the person it just lowers their debt. So now we&#39;re forcing the
struggling home owner family to come up with six thousand dollars, fifty
eight hundred in cash that they don&#39;t have otherwise they would have
been paying their mortgage in the first place. So what we&#39;re going
to end up dong is actually pushing struggling folks into foreclosure who
the investor and mortgage company saw fit to renegotiate their debt. So
what I would want as the bill sponsor is will you not accept an
amendment to take this
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. And Mr. Chairman if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I let you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This was decoupled last year. And I asked everybody in this room if they
heard from anyone who said once if there was a concern about it and the
ones that I&#39;ve heard and there are many have not heard one
complaint. This was put together because of the fact there was that
bubble. It was designed to be a temporary fix and I think Senator
Mckissick will tell you it wasn&#39;t done prior that it was a meant to
be a temporary solution during a time that it needed to be corrected. At
some point you need to stop it we stopped it last year. We&#39;re
continuing stopping it because of the fact the number of foreclosures
don&#39;t exist as significantly as they were. So the bottom line is I
don&#39;t want to change this anything different then what came out of
revenue law who sat down spent three four months trying to put together
this bill which is a good bill and I would like the Senate to pass it
just like you did earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Seeing no other hands. Seeing one hand Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I move for a favorable report?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right I&#39;ll take that and I&#39;m seeing no other hands we have a
motion for a favorable report all in favor aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bill passes. Senator Rucho thank you. We got the encampa asset sale for
discussion only. And Senator Newton is recognized you co-conspirator is
not with us today oh yes he here she is Senator Bryant. Welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I say that Senator Pate is the one that mediates. You want to join
us Senator Pate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you members of the committee. Many of you
have heard a little bit of this bill this morning in commerce where we
had a really good discussion and voted this bill out. And I&#39;ll try
not to be too giddy about what we&#39;re doing here today and try to hit
the high points. So I appreciate the opportunity to be here to talk
about this bill. Senator Bryant, Senator Pate, my friend Jeff Collins
and representative Susan Martin and others have worked on this piece of
legislation and this issue for now many years. For those that don&#39;t
know, don&#39;t live in Eastern North Carolina or some of these
communities I believe you have a bill summary in your packet and if
you&#39;ll look on the back of your bill summary it lists out the cities
that are effected directly by this legislation. A little just a little
brief history the cities back in the late seventies and eighties decided
to become invest

  —investors and partners in electrical generating facilities. They own
part ownership in shearon harris, the two nuclear reactors in Brunswick
and Southport, and two coal fire plants. When they did this, they took
on billions of dollars worth of debt. And they&#39;ve struggled with
that debt for a very long time, and today they still owe one-point-eight
billion dollars [$1.8B] in debt. And what this means for the rate payers
in these cities that buy electricity from their cities is that
they&#39;re not just paying for the electricity like everybody else
does, but they&#39;ve got to pay the debt! And that is adding a premium
to their bills that they&#39;ve been dealing with for decades, that
varies from city to city, but in many cases is as high as a 40— 35 or 40
percent premium over what other, similar rate payers have in other parts
of the state.
As you can imagine, this is a tremendous and huge economic detriment to
the area. It obviously is a disincentive to recruiting new industries
and new business, it&#39;s very difficult for small businesses that pay
maybe a couple of hundred dollars a month extra on their bills as a
small business, or more, and certainly families— and working families in
particular. Senator Bryant and I, and others, are very familiar with
folks who, truthfully, go months at a time without power, keep their
food in a cooler on the porch. These are true stories. And it&#39;s just
very, very hard. So it&#39;s hard to believe, in a way, that we&#39;re
here today with an opportunity to do something about it.
The cities, through ElectriCities&#39; NCEMPA, for years have negotiated
with— first Progress Energy used to be the old CP&amp;L, and later,
Duke-Progress, after the merger, and over time they found a way to come
to an agreement, which was the only way to solve this problem, which was
for, basically, Duke-Progress to buy its partners out.  So they&#39;re
buying out the shares that the cities own. And they&#39;re doing that
for a price of one-point-two billion dollars [$1.2B].
So, I&#39;ll first point out to you this purchase does not erase all the
debt— it erases about seventy percent of the debt. And the cities are
still responsible for the remaining debt. And guess what? They&#39;re
very happy to do that. They want to do that, even though they&#39;re
still paying on a debt for assets that they will no longer own if we
complete this deal. So what this piece of legislation does, in short
order, is it legislates what&#39;s necessary in order to complete this
deal. It provides for the cities on how they&#39;re gonna refinance the
remaining debt, and it provides the mechanism that Duke will be allowed
to recover its cost, which will be spread out over a very long period of
time.
Now, with that, I commend the Bill to you. I really appreciate the broad
based support that we&#39;ve had so far on this Bill, I think we&#39;re
over twenty-three or -four co-sponsors so far— I hope we have fifty
before we&#39;re done. But, anyway, with that I&#39;d like to stop, Mr.
Chairman, if I could, and turn it over to my colleague, Senator Bryant,
and let her make a few questions, and if it&#39;s okay with you we can
dive into the Bill with staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I look forward to us having a discussion on it, and Senator
Bryant, you&#39;re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Senator Bryant]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. It&#39;s great to
be here with you on this particular Bill. It&#39;s very important to me
because I became intimately familiar with this issue in 2003, when I was
serving as a city councilwoman in Rockymount, and at the same time, soon
after that became— as I was trying to understand: Why are we saddled
with this problem? I purposefully became Eastern Power Agency
Commissioner during that time, and learned about ElectriCities&#39;
structure and set-up and situation, and how we ended up in the situation
we are with this crippling debt that you have seen described.
And we have the opportunity to take a major step today that is in line
with many of the discussions we&#39;ve been having in this committee,
around how do we deal with the uneven recovery and economic inequities
that exist throughout the state. So today you have a chance to take a
step at solving, at the structural level, one of those inequities we
face in the east that&#39;s overlayed upon the uneven economic recovery
that we have already been experiencing. And it&#39;s in— the three sort
of major players in this scenario: There&#39;s the Eastern Municipal
Power Agency cities [who are on the back of your chart]; there&#39;s
Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Carolinas. And we all benefit. Our
power agency customers are too

  170,000 of them. Some of them will get relief, needed relief, from
their, from higher utility bills than their neighbors. The Duke Energy
progress. Customers get access to cheaper fuel. And ultimately, relief
on their power bills. And then the Duke Energy Carolina customers get to
benefit from economic development benefits throughout the state. So we
are hoping that you will support us in this effort and thanks to all of
you who&#39;ve already been helpful with us. There are financial details
that the staff will review and we surely will answer questions about
that. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, Senator Paig. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. We&#39;ve been looking forward to this for a long time and I
certainly congratulate Senator Newton for all the hard work he&#39;s
done. And this is a win-win for the eastern part of the state. And I
think the whole state is going to see value in this. And I certainly
hope that this bill will pass. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Paig.
Before we move into the discussion phase of this bill, I believe Senator
Newton has a clarifying amendment to offer at this time.
And we will take in vote on this amendment to get it out so everybody
can see what it is. And then next week we plan on Tuesday unless we make
a change in this thing, is to have a discussion ?? and the vote on it.
Unless there&#39;s, something complicates it. That&#39;s the plan right
now. Senator Newton, you&#39;re recognized on the amendment.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I&#39;d like to send forth this
amendment. I&#39;m not sure ?? And thank you Mr. Chairman. And I would
ask, if I could, get Heather Fennel to explain it technically.
Basically, in short, this is something that the industrial customers
requested that basically clarifies, as I understand it, and the way I
read it and the way it&#39;s been explained to me, clarifies assumptions
that we were already operating on under anyway.
And if I could, Mr. Chairman, if Heather would give a more precise
explanation other than. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Heather. And you need to
find this ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Thank
you. In a Ray case, the cost of the utilities are allocated among the
right classes. So that would be the industrial, commercial, and
residential customers. So that&#39;s how the costs are allocated. What
the two changes in this bill do, as I explained the bill I can explain
them further, but basically it makes sure that any adjustments under the
writer that this bill allows are gonna use the customer class
allocations that were decided in the last Ray case.
So it doesn&#39;t allow that question to be opened up every year in the
writer and to potentially have those allocations changed. So that&#39;s
what the first two changes do. There is a third hand written change and
that change is just correcting a statutory cross reference that we got
incorrect. So that&#39;s just deleting that incorrect reference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, thank you. And you&#39;ve heard the
explanation of the amendment. Do we have a question on the amendment? We
have a motion from Colonel Rayben.
That we approve the amendment as read. All in favor. Any other
discussions? ?? All in favor, aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any opposed. amendments ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. If Mr. Chairman, if I could ask Heather Fennel to basically
explain the bill in the more technical sense. And then we&#39;ll, if it
pleases your Chairmanship, we&#39;ll go into questions and discussion.
I&#39;m used to saying that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You in court today? Well,
I&#39;ve appeared many times.
If Heather will give us a summary, at least, and then if there&#39;s
questions we&#39;ll have details ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Yes,
sir. So the first section of the bill provides cost recovery for any
utility that purchases the assets of a joint municipal power agency.
Subsection A of this new section establishes the writer. So the cost of
acquiring these generation facilities will be recovered in our writer as
opposed to general Ray case. The writer will be set each year by the
utilities commission. And the writer will not begin until after a
hearing at the commission.
This first section also defines acquisition cost as the full amount paid
for the assets including any amount above net book value. Subsection B
determines the costs that are allowed in the writer. What&#39;s going to
be allowed in the writer is the acquisition cost, the financing cost,
and the operating cost. And this will actually include adjustments that
are used to reflect the changes in the proportion of the wholesale and
to the retail load in the state that will occur after this.
And then again, one of the changes that was put in by Senator
Newton&#39;s amendment. It clarifies that the customer allocation that
was in the last Ray case will be used to determine

  <p id="20:00">
  the cost allowed in the rider. Subsection C requires the utility to
provide certain information to commission in determining the amount of
the rider each year. The utility would need to provide information on
any over or under recovery resulting from the rider from the previous
year, any changes to the cost from the previous year, any changes in
capital, and again, added by the amendment, any changes to the customer
allocation methodology that was determined in the last general rate
case. Subsection D provides that this rider will expire at the end of
the useful life of the acquisition of the acquired facilities and if you
can see from your summary, the useful life is provided there and it
basically ranges from 20-31 years. So that&#39;s the cost recovery for
the utility. The remaining sections of the bill, sections two through
eight, make changes to 159B of the general statutes, and these are the
statutes that govern the joint municipal power agencies. So these are
the agencies that are made up of the cities that have purchased the
ownership assets in these generation facilities. The first section,
section two, actually just changes the purposes of that chapter. Section
three changes the duties of the joint agencies to allow that they can
use the revenues from the joint operated systems and their distribution
systems to pay for the new bonds that are authorized under this bill.
Section four authorizes support contracts. Support contracts are the way
in which the municipal power agencies are going to pay for the new
bonds. The support contracts by the joint agency will allow the cities
to pay their proportionate share of the bonds and it will allow them to
pay the refinanced amount to finance any collateral posting requirements
of the replacement power supply arrangements and it will also allow them
to finance any required reserves. The support contract can last for 30
years and it will also provide that any of the member municipalities
that are on the contract agree to pay the proportionate share of any
other city if that city defaults under the contract. There is new
language, you can look on page eight, starting lines six through seven,
that requires that the payments under the support contracts are
considered operating costs and therefore they&#39;ll be paid first from
the revenues from the electric system. Also, on page eight, lines 43-49,
it has language that allows the LGC to take over any city that is
negligent in paying for its obligations under the bonds. Section five is
the actual language that provides the new bonding authority in
subsection B, it&#39;s on page nine, lines 31-44. What the purpose of
the new bonds being issued for is on lines 34-37, new bonds may be
issued for paying the difference between the costs of the project
that&#39;s being sold and the amount that the joint agency still owes on
those assets, and new bonds may be used to finance any collateral
posting requirements that are needed for the replacement power supply
arrangements. These bonds will be paid with revenues derived from the
projects, the sale of power of the cities of the municipal power
agencies and with the support contracts that are authorized under this
bill. The remaining sections, sections six, seven, and eight, what this
does is clarify, make conforming changes to other sections of chapter
159B that makes it clear that the cities in the joint municipal power
agencies can use the revenues from the sale of the power to pay for
these new bonds as well as the existing bonds. And this act effective
when it becomes law and I&#39;m happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, there&#39;s that [??] for the bill now and it&#39;s open for
discussion. We&#39;ll go to the members first and, we&#39;ll go to
members first if we have questions that you have, now is the time. I see
Senator Hise. I can barely see you over there, you&#39;ve lost weight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess the first thing I wanted to ask about
is for each of these municipalities or MPA&#39;s to issue a bond for
their remaining debt that they&#39;re being held, what is the
expectations, because with a third of this, Wilson&#39;s still going to
have to almost $80-100 Million in debt they&#39;re going to have to
issue a bond for, do you have that kind of capacity for these for a bond
issue and are the rates anything we could generally expect?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The short answer is yes, they do, and I think that folks ElectriCities
could probably explain that a little bit more precisely than I can but
this is, the bonds are collective. As I understand it, it&#39;s not each
city getting its own bond. So it&#39;s not a city&#39;s bond rating
that&#39;s effected, and that&#39;s part of the situation is that if one
city or town

  was unable to was in jeopardy of defaulting or did default. All the
other cities remain are responsible for their, they&#39;re all in it
together. They&#39;re all responsible for it. That&#39;s in part to get
a more advantageous bond situation. Bond rating.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton. Sure Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to add I mean that&#39;s sort of the reason they formed
the joint municipal power agency is for that collective capacity. But
there are also provisions in here that require them to use the revenue
deal with the debt and maintain that asset so they can be responsible
for the debt and the wholesale power agreement they gonna have and the
local government commission has the power to intervene if there&#39;s
any indication they are not managing their finances in such a way as to
be responsible for the bond and the business the utility business that
they have. Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton follow up there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. And one thing I want to add is right now
they&#39;re paying on a whole lot more debt. And the basis they have to
pay the debt is their rates. So their customer base their rate base
isn&#39;t changing at all with this bill. So they have the same
customers the same rate base their just going to be freed to reduce
their rates because they don&#39;t have nearly as much cost after this
deal is completed. So they should be in a much easier position to pay
these bonds. Much, much easier position to pay these bonds after the
fact then where they are today. And there&#39;s not been any problem
paying these bonds so far even with all this because the rates are so
high.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton I think Senator Hise asked a question this morning
they&#39;re still going to have six hundred or eight hundred million
dollars of debt and they weren&#39;t able to pay the load they had
before and matter of fact they, many of them didn&#39;t. They were
paying and spending on other things. However, I&#39;m assured by Senator
Newton and the rest of you we have tightly drawn this thing to where
we&#39;re not going to be repossessing city halls and sidewalks. And I
think Senator Hise that was probably your concern and I think that was
addressed. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman a question if I may on line with what Senator Hise talked
about. The state of North Carolina wasn&#39;t liable for the debt
initially. And at the level of one point eight, what was it, how much is
the debt right now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s been, if I may Mr. Chairman, it&#39;s been paid down to one
point eight billion now as of today it was a little over three billion
to begin with if I remember correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These bonds will pay off about a billion of that now. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
About one point two billion is what I understand. And so under the
circumstances the state of North Carolina wasn&#39;t liable for it but
there was always the concern that if any of those municipalities failed
the state would come in and intercede and try to bail them out
basically. But the fact that one point two has been paid off and
there&#39;s a six hundred million dollar balance due with the same rate
base hopefully lower rates to help your communities that will no longer
be an issue for the state to have to worry about bailing them out under
these circumstances therefore the state of North Carolina has less
financial liability to this case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, Senator I think the point if I understand your point is
absolutely right. I quite honestly I&#39;m not sure what obligation the
state had before but whatever there was there will be a lot less of it
now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good point Senator, good answer too I think that&#39;s exactly where we
are right now with the financial end of it. I saw Senator Cook about an
hour ago, Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I just want to say, comment. That for several years in my
church there was a sweet old lady who every summer I and others in the
church would have to help her with her electric bill. This was in
Washington one of the electric cities. And I always thought jeez
there&#39;s got to be a better way here and the more I looked into that
electric cities problem I just didn&#39;t see a way out. And I can&#39;t
tell you how happy and how proud I am of all of us. This is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook I think what your saying is your probably not going to have
to pay her bill any more.[Laughter] Thank you, thank you. Senator ?? no
wonder your thankful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That wasn&#39;t exactly it, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s what what I got out of it.

  I move for a favorable report.
SPEAKER CHANGES
We&#39;re not going to vote it today. You&#39;ll get that chance
Tuesday. See that? You had a ?? vote for this thing already. I don&#39;t
see no other hands. No, excuse me. Senator Jackson.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Newton, I understand what we&#39;re
doing here, and having represented Kinston?? I understand the burden
they were under and I completely understand that, but could you explain
to me a little bit how the rate payers that are outside of these are
going to be affected, and how it will benefit them in the long run?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Sure.
SPEAKER CHANGES
In the short term and the long run, explain that a little bit, please.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Senator, I certainly will. So what Duke Progress is
purchasing is generating capacity. They are purchasing about 700
megawatts of generating capacity, 500 of which is nuclear. And the
current cost of producing that, those assets, is about $16 a megawatt,
if I&#39;ve got my figures right. The current cost of production for
Duke with its other generating assets is $33 a megawatt. So what
they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re buying generating assets that produce
it at a lot cheaper. And the best way I understand the term that&#39;s
been used is it&#39;s a fuel cost savings. So what&#39;s happening is
the Duke Progress customers and Duke Progress are locking in a lower
fuel cost, and they&#39;re going to be able to use that over the life of
these projects. And so long term, those customers, they get the benefit
of that, and that&#39;s going to cost everybody less in the end. Now, it
varies, depending on what kind of rate payer they are as to whether they
see immediate cost reduction, or whether that&#39;s delayed a little
while. And so if you are a large industrial, for example, my
understanding and everything that I&#39;ve seen shows that they have an
immediate reduction in their costs. And I&#39;ve heard of some
particular industries that it ranges from $11,000 a year up to several
hundred thousand dollars a year in savings. But it varies.
SPEAKER CHANGES
All right. Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
So basically what you&#39;re saying is most everybody&#39;s going to
benefit from this deal and their won&#39;t be any increases in
folk&#39;s utility bills.
SPEAKER CHANGES
So let me be more precise, since you asked the question that way.
Everybody over time benefits from this deal. There are some rate payers
who, in the first couple of years, will see a very, very small increase
in their bill. For example, it&#39;s estimated that the average
residential customer may see 22 cents a month. So less than $3 or $4 a
year. But that would end after a few--after a couple of years, I think
it&#39;s year 4, and from that point down it would start going down, and
so over the life of the project, they&#39;re going to have a net savings
overall because they&#39;re locking in that cheaper fuel cost and that
cheaper cost of production.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you. Good question. I believe that there&#39;ll be benefits,
Senator, from reading your bill and talking to you. I think there are
going to be benefits immediately for some of the bigger users,
commercial and industrial, which will recruit in industry quicker
because their cost is going to be less at the get-go and over about a
four-year period. Even those 22-, 30-cent increases for the residential
will go down over maybe a four-year period is what I think I…
SPEAKER CHANGES
One more follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Being you talked so long, Mr. Chairman, I raised another question. I
understand on the residentials, and I understand the industrial. What
about the commercial customers?
SPEAKER CHANGES
So the commercial customers vary, as the Chairman indicated, based on
their usage, the size they are. So a larger commercial operation should
see immediate cost savings. A smaller customer, such
as--hypothetically--such as like maybe a convenience store might see a
small increase for a couple years, maybe $80, $100 a year at the tops, a
year, for just a few years and then, again, like everybody else, it goes
back down. And so assuming that they stay in business for a little
longer than four years, they should see a net benefit from this deal.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, good question. Senator Davis from the mountains.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Newton, I understand that a significant
part of the generation capacity is coal-generated. Is that correct?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Chairman. Actually it&#39;s about five--of the 700 megawatts, 500 of
it is nuclear, and the remain-

  200 is coal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any potential for North Carolina to be negatively impacted by
the EPA&#39;s so-called war on coal?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not from this deal. Honestly, I think the best way to answer this is
that is part of the factor of why Duke negotiated to buy these assets,
because the nuclear is a very advantageous way, in that context, is a
very advantageous way for them to generate electricity. So that was part
of the benefit for them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, if they win that battle on coal then we&#39;re all going
to pay out the wazoo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s true.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, and I believe may conclude the questions. Let&#39;s start
all over. Senator Rucho, Chairman Rucho, you&#39;re recognized and then
we&#39;re going to go back to Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Davis, that was a very good question
because if those 200 megawatts that exist because of coal aren&#39;t in
jeopardy where you lose the ability to generate electricity to pay your
debt down, am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s, we got assurances through Duke and all the others? Okay. Mr.
Chairman, I&#39;d like to comment, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think this is an excellent bill and I do applaud the sponsors to it. I
think, in the big picture, which was what the General Assembly and I
know Senator Newton knows for sure, that this General Assembly has
worked very hard and this is another step in the direction of trying to
make sure that all 100 counties in North Carolina have an opportunity of
prosperity and so next Tuesday we look forward to being able to move it
in. Hopefully, Senator Newton, you can get it put on the floor next
Tuesday for a vote, okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You heard that, you heard everything but a favorable report. He almost
slipped up and said that but-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Out of habit, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m going back, I saw Senator Hise and then I saw Colonel Rabin and
then I didn&#39;t see any more after that. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. One of the things in briefly looking over these
projections and h how the savings come in is that the expectation is
that over time the base cost of generating energy for Duke Progress will
go up and that we&#39;ve locked in this rate here that&#39;s consistent
and so as that grows more and more then you&#39;re saving over what you
would have been paying. Are there any protections, if we have a
significant change in the energy market from something, say natural gas
exploration in the state of North Carolina, that makes that base load
protection actually cheaper instead of increasing in cost that would
change these dynamics so that the rest of the state now has energy at a
lower cost or makes those adjustments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I understand your question.
So all the work that we&#39;ve done all along and my working with all
the parties involved in this, this has been modeled out under a variety
of scenarios, as in cheaper energy, really cheap, natural gas for
example, as you eluded to versus higher cost energy. Frankly, we&#39;ve
tried to stick it at the low end on these projections, in other words
cheap energy, but if energy costs go up, of course this deal gets better
and better. Of course these energy costs effect everybody, regardless of
whether this deal is completed or not. I&#39;m satisfied and all the
parties are satisfied that under the speculative scenario of maybe
falling, it&#39;s hard to imagine that gas can get a lot cheaper than
where it is right now, but even if it did or it just stayed the same,
we&#39;re satisfied that this still is a benefit to everyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good question, good answer, and Colonel Rabin, Senator, Colonel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, well whichever outranks I&#39;ll take. This is more of a
comment. Serendipitously, today, a delegation from one of the affected
areas stopped in to my office and I&#39;ve maintained all along that the
real basis for this is the economic development impact that it can have
all over the state as it runs out. They&#39;re just ecstatic in this
town that this is coming about because they feel it will make them very
competitive with their neighboring towns and be able to spur their
economic growth beyond what they could have done before because of the
higher rates. It will affect not only that township, that town, that
city, but that whole part of

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right thank you for your comments. Well take one more Senator
Daniels.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there a closing date? Mr. Chairman do you have a closing date for
this already or I assume this is like a debt you&#39;ve go to pay it off
you&#39;ve got to issue new debt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if I remember correctly, Mr. Chairman if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I remember correctly the agreement between necempa and electro cities
and due progress is this deal has to be completed by the end of the
year. I think that if we are able to move this legislation and get it
signed by the governor in short order candidly it should be with what
steps are left should be completed I think reasonably I think by late
this fall. And that&#39;s the rate payers in the necempa areas will see
an immediate rate relief as soon as it&#39;s completed. So my personal
goal and hope is that before winter and cold weather really sets in that
the new lower rates will be in place. If that&#39;s addressing your
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Newton, thank you Senator Daniels and members.
Appreciate your input and your questions. And at this time the meeting
is adjourned.
