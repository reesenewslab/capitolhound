[SPEAKER CHANGES] We lost a great man today. Our friend, many of you
knew, Senator Blake. Some of you did not know him. But, I suppose if any
one man who put their mark on the economic development of an area in the
Pinehurst area in the Moore County area. It would be Senator Blake.
Developed one of the early business parks and it’s going on strong
today. I think he owned every office in there and his office was there.
I was down last Monday, one week ago from the day to see my friend, my
former seatmate here for several years and did not get to see him, he
was not well but I left him a card, I hoped and prayed that he did see
that before he passed away. But, if we could adjourn today in the memory
of Senator Harris Blake, Mr. President I would think that would be
fitting.

...job talking about our dear friend, Senator Blake. But I feel
compelled to share a story. It's one of the greatest things I've ever
seen happen in the General Assembly—Jerry, you might remember it. We
were in a Commerce Committee meeting, and a bill had been brought forth
to take plastic bottles back to receive a deposit on it. And one of the
first locations to be set up for that was a church in Granville County.
And they said they would make it an official redemption center. Well
Senator Blake, without batting an eye, said, “Well, isn't that what a
church is anyway?” [Laughter from floor] So I thought that was perfect,
and I think it's a great way to say goodbye to our friend. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Senator Berger is recognized for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, we're going
to...the motion's going to be to adjourn to 9:30 in the morning, but we
will not have any bills on the calendar at that time. We will not take
up any business until 2:00. The purpose of opening at 9:30 will be to
allow the flow of bills to move back and forth between committees, as
we'll have a number of committee meetings tomorrow. With that, Mr.
President, I move that the Senate do now adjourn in memory of Senator
Harris Blake, subject to the receipt and re-referral of messages to the
House and the Governor, the introduction, referral, and re-referral of
bills and resolutions, the receipt and re-referral of committee reports,
and the ratification of bills, to reconvene on Tuesday, June 10, 2014 at
9:30 a.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motions is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject
to the stipulations stated by Senator Berger and in memory of Senator
Harris Blake, to reconvene Tuesday, June 10 at 9:30 a.m., seconded by
Senator Brock. All in favor, say “aye.” [“Aye” from floor] All opposed,
say “no.” The ayes have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
