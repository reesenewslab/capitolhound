 Members and visitors will please silence all electronic devices.  A
prayer will be offered by Representative Steinburg.  Members and

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning, members of the House and guests, let us
pray.  Almighty God, ruler of all nations, who has cast our lot in this
land of civil and religious liberty, give us we pray thee a true sense
of our privileges and responsibilities as a nation and a people.  We
thank thee for the patriotic men and women of the past who generous
devotion to the common good has been the making of our state.  Grant
that our generation may build worthily on the foundations they have
laid.  Bless the cause of sound learning everywhere.  We thank thee that
the sum of human knowledge is being increased.  We praise thy name for
all that knowledge has done and is doing for the well being of mankind.
In the spread of comfort among men, and the prevention and cure of
disease, in the promotion of good feeling, in social service and
philanthropic efforts, in improved matters and in refined living, send
out thy light and thy truth that men may not be satisfied with either
ignorant faith or an unbelieving knowledge.  May the work of the General
Assembly and of all the institutions of our state, that have for their
object the safe-guarding, enriching, and enlarging the lives of the
people, hasten the coming of thy kingdom on Earth, for thy namesake we
pray. Amen.

of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
