<p id="00:00">
Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to call this meeting to order.
First, I wanna begin by thanking our Pages, which are here. With us
today, we have Cameron McNeal from Senator Berger.  And please just
stand or raise your hand when I call your name. Connor Mendenhall,
Senator Barefoot. Angelique Knight, Senator Clark. Otta Olabon(?),
Senator Barefoot. Patrick Sige from Senator Goolsby. Ariel Harris,
Senator Bryant. Alex Mcraya from Senator Berger. Jasmine McNeal, Senator
Blue.  Raven Waters, Bill Cook, Senator Cook.  And Caroline Holler from
Senator Rabin. Thank you for your time and service and I hope that this
is a great experience for you this week. I also want to thank our
Sergeants at Arms. We have Ken Kirby, Charles Marsalas, Anderson Meadows
and Steve Wilson. We have, we're gonna be adjusting today's schedule
just slightly. We're going to be hearing Senate Bill 793, the Charter
School Bill. We're gonna, it's gonna be for discussion only. We're going
to have 15 minutes designated for that and we're not going to be voting
on that today. And then we're gonna go to the Student Records Bill,
Senate Bill 815, so that we can finish up with Senate Bill 812. At this
time, can we have Senator Tillman. Will you please explain Senate Bill
793 for us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, with your permission I will have staff to go through this
bill quickly. They know it as well, if not better than I do. And then,
we will have a little discussion, hold it to 15 minutes, and we'll
decide whether we're gonna vote it next week or not. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the proposed committee substitute for Senate Bill 793 would do the
following things. The first section would provide a specific application
review and recommendation process for the Charter School Advisory
Committee that would allow input from charter applicants that are
getting initial recommendations of non-approval, allowing them to
provide input and petition to appear before the Advisory Board and the
State Board. Section Two of the bill provides in statue that the State
Board would adopt a schedule each year for the review of all charter
applications with specific information that's provided in that schedule,
including deadlines and timelines for the review of applications and the
submission of applications, and what the State Board would have to
publish on its website, again dealing with the schedule and the review
of charter applications. And then, Subsection E of that same section,
would provide that the State Board's Fee for all charter applications
and renewal applications would be $1000. It would eliminate the
discretion that they currently have in setting the fee between 500 and
1000. Section Three of the bill would change the date by which the State
Board does a final decision on charter applications from January 15th to
August 15th, so that final decisions would have to be made by the State
Board by August 15 of a calendar year. And they could make that final
decision for approval contingent upon the completion of a planning year,
prior to enrollment of students, which is the policy that they currently
follow right now by having a planning year.  So, this would codify what
is currently being practiced by the State Board. And it would also, the
bill would also clarify that final decisions of the State Board denying
charter applications, can be appealed by commencing a contested case
with Office of Administrative Hearings. And then Section Four would
clarify that a charter school who has a mission of single gender
education may limit admission on the basis of gender for the students at
the school. Section Six says, excuse me, provides that the State Board,
with respect to adopting the application schedule, the yearly
application schedule, and the form and evaluation rubric, would be
exempt from rulemaking for those provisions. And Section Seven allows
the Revisor of Statutes to renumber and recodify the charter school
statutes to a more suitable location. We are running[END OF RECORDING]</p>

Statute numbers in that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before we move forward, this is a PCS to have a motion
to adopt the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion moved by Senator Cook, all in favor to adopt
the PCS, say Aye. Oppose, No. The Ayes have it and PCS has explained
this before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, if we’re ready to proceed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me explain how we got to the point where we  are
today and I wanna be frank with you in another discussion that we’re
gonna have. We have a newly established, I think they’ve been on board 8
or 9 months now, maybe 10 - Charter Advisory Board that review
applications and recommend approvals or disapprovals. The process – the
Advisory Board will be the first to tell you what’s flawed and many
mistakes, I do believe have been made in that process and now we’re
gonna be opening that up in this Bill when we get to it. I’m considering
some fast track legislation also to move this process forward. I’d like
to see Charter ?? approved rather than disapproved - some on
technicalities, some on other things that may or may not be in the how
the beholder buyer sees and PMOs have been sort of shut out of the
process. Whether that’s because of flaws in the application process or
not, I do not know. But I do know that some changes have to be made. I’m
also smart enough to know that whatever we put in the process will not
change significantly and as the man said of those people making these
decisions and recommendation changes. Now, I’m willing to give them the
opportunity to change their own house and put it in order and I hope,
Mr. Chairman, we can hear from Joe Medley today because I think he is
trying to work with the Charter Board to approve these processes.
They’ve agreed and I’ve agreed that some of these things would be
necessary. I want to see what they recommend to the State Board in
cleaning up this mess. Now, if they make the changes that are necessary,
I don’t have to move this bill. But I’ll also tell you that if these
changes do not take place not just on paper but in the mindset then
other things will be considered and I will tend to have the ??. We got
some very honorable and very good and expert people, I talk to them all
the time. They’ve been supportive of me and I’ve been supportive of
them. But there’s no question about the process being flawed. So I wanna
hold things right now and decide after what I hear today from Mr.
Chairman, if it’s permissible to hear from the director, Joe Medley, I
think he’s here today. I would like for him to explain what these new
processes are briefly and then answer a couple of questions. With your
permission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The appeal here is that I’ve got couple of Senator’s
some questions, we’re gonna hear from Mr. Medley who might address some
of your issues a little bit and then we’ll lie to have those questions.
So, Mr. Medley if you could and in the interest of time, let me show
remarks to 2 minutes, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good Afternoon. Senator Tillman, Senator Soucek, Thank
you for the opportunity to be able to speak with you. At 11:30 this
morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please, for the record if you could say who you are
and where’re you from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m Joe Medley and I’m the director of North Carolina
office of Charter Schools and work in the department of public
instruction. This morning, I presented to the State Board of Education a
process that was unanimously approved by the Charter School Advisory
Board. It is on the State Board’s website that’s for public review. And
I’d like to give you, very briefly, the process that was used in order
to arrive to this. The chair of Advisory Board, Ms. Helen Nance has
convened the subcommittee even though we have not finished the review
process that is currently forth going and brought together 5 members of
the advisory board to look at the process. Having heard from groups in
order to be able to make changes in the suggestions to the State Board
of Education. The changes that have been proposed are, we believe, would
mitigate some of the concerns that have been raised too many views
whilst what we’ve heard as well. The process would begin with the
application ?? fine questions that need to be made. So there are two
opportunities for them to able to hear from the applicant groups before
the decision to recommendation are made for an interview. Other changes
in the process are going to include the fact that there were some
duplicative questions that we did notice in the application they’d
removed and there’re some sections that were not as clear cut with the
responses that we wanted. So those are being revised. All the
application in the automated process should be ready to go by the middle
of July before the application to be submitted by the end of September.
Those were just the brief overviews but the key is that these groups are
now being given the opportunity to be able to provide information back
to the Advisory Board, so it is more open.</p>

Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you very much. Senator Tillman do you have
something to add?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Medley I have been in contact with many of these
people that have been disproved or not approved for various reasons and
I just want to say for the record, if you have a strong financial
background, a strong organizational setup, with a strong board and
access to facilities at your disposal and you are denied where you’ve
been successful in other states, I think we’ve got a flaw in the
thinking there and I want that corrected. I also ask you if a member of
your board or you said we’ve got a great application here and I love it
but I hate to see that it’s an EMO. Whether you did or not Mr. Medley,
that bias is everybody’s opinion that heard that, including mine. Now I
don’t know what’s right or wrong and I want to give you all the chance
to get your house in order but I can smell something in Denmark that I
don’t like. I think your changes are good but unless there’s a mindset
change Mr. Medley, I don’t care how many processes you put on the paper.
 So I want to see a systematic change, you’ve been in there a little
while, you’ve got some great people who can do that job I believe, if
not we’ll look at those options in the long session. That’s all I have
to say.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Alright thank you Senator Tillman. I did have a few
questions over here. I saw Senator Bryant first if you..
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I had two questions. One is I don’t know what an EMO is
and what is the big dispute about EMOs and is it an unidentified flying
object or what is it? I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] An EMO is a financially managed group that promotes
starters in other locations outside of North Carolina and they’re viable
organizations and for some reasons some folks don’t like EMOs, but I’m
looking at innovative ideas folks and I’m looking at whatever we can
gain from somebody else. If it comes from another state I don’t care
whether they’re privately managed or whether they’re corporately
managed, that makes no different to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And I had a second question which is on the summary I
saw the removal of open meetings requirements for charter boards but I
couldn’t see in my quick perusal of the PCS where it is in the PCS? Is
that in there somewhere or not in there, which I wish it were not? But
can I get an answer and then I have a comment to make.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’ll let staff answer that one if they will.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] There is a reference to one of the changes the PCS made
was to take out a section that would have added requirements about the
open meetings law. That actually those requirements are dealt with in
the charters that are signed by the various charter schools. It’s one of
the requirements the state board puts into the charter regarding open
meetings.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I still am trying to understand, it says in the summary
remove the provision that stated that the charter school and its board
are subject to public records and open meeting laws. Where are we
removing it from and where is that in this PCS? That’s what I’m confused
about.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] In the edition of the bill that was introduced, you
have a PCS in front of you so if you look at the first edition of the
bill it had codified provision that charters were subject to personnel
records and open meetings laws and personal records statutes. In the PCS
that codified language is removed so that’s where that provision in the
summary comes from, but the way charters are currently signed and
drafted they are subject to open meetings laws and the personnel records
statute because that is the agreement a charter makes with the state
board in its charter agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  But it is not statutorily required by either statute
or rule?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It is not addressed in the statutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there a reason why we decided to remove it?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Tillman that would be something you might be
able to address.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I don’t know, I was under the assumption that all these
bodies were subject to the open meetings laws of the state so I don’t
know why they’re not and I’ll be willing to look at that. We’re not
going to vote this bill today, we’ve got some work to do on it and I
just want to see where we’re going today to know what we need to do next
week, whether we have this bill or we don’t have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] One brief comment Mr. Chair on that. For some of my
parents I think it will be important to consider that because some of
the parents in my district..</p>

… have felt not as welcome at some of the meetings, since they’re
private non-profits and all. They can come but not as included, and I
think any changes you make like that that might set up a less open
environment would be a hindrance for the involvement of parents, and I
just want to encourage you to codify that if you can. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Points well made. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, do
you have a question or comment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually Mr. Chair,
that was my question there, so… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, very good.
Were there any other questions? This is all for discussion only. I’ll
have one more and then we need to move on, otherwise we won’t get to
anything else. Senator Robinson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Just a couple of questions to catch up with Senator Tillman’s anger over
what’s going on that we didn’t know anything about, but could I have
some information in terms of if…? What I hear is some recommendations
that were made that the state board looks like needs to consider, but
has the state board had time to review the recommendations? Is there set
up somewhere a time period where when the advisory board makes
recommendations, the state board shall receive and consider them? Has it
had time to really review and respond appropriately? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think so, Mr. Chairman. I think so,
Senator Robinson. I’ve not heard any complaint on that end of it. I
think the state board has had adequate time to make their final approval
or disapproval. I have not heard any complaint about that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] A follow-up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And if staff can tell me, how many charters do we
currently have and how many were approved the last cycle? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We’ll have staff get with you on that one. It’s for discussion
only; it’s not necessary to have that right this moment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] They’ll get it to you. We’ve got time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
thank you. We just wanted to open this up so we can get people’s minds
thinking of the PCS is front of us so we could discuss this. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Senator Graham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it’s a very good request that she made that’s
kind of germane to the discussion I think, so I would love to get that
information as well in terms of who’s on first and who’s on second,
who’s been approved and who’s been denied. I think the public would
probably want to know as well as we sit here discussing it, but also,
this next week we’ll talk a little bit more about the approval process
itself, and obviously I support charter schools – I support good charter
schools – and sometimes we need to deny them. So I just want to kind of
get a sense of the anger. I hear more anger than policy here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That’s a very good point. What we’ll do is we’ll get that
information, we’ll distribute it to all the members of this committee.
Well thank you. Thank you for presenting that and we will continue to
move forward on that. Next before us we do have a PCS. Is this correct,
Senator Barefoot? We’ve got a PCS to Senate Bill 815, to see a motion to
adopt the PCS. This is from Senator Curtis. All in favor, aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The ayes have it and the
PCS is before us. Senator Barefoot, please explain. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This bill comes to us as a recommendation of
the I.T. Oversight Committee. It seeks to ensure the privacy of our
student data record. The product that you see before you is one where
we’ve worked with key stakeholders, both with the department, with
associations and with companies that have contracts with the state of
North Carolina, and if I can, I’m going to defer to staff to explain the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 1 of
Senate Bill 815 would make several requirements for the state Board of
Education to make with regards to the student data system. The first
thing they would be required to do would be to create a data inventory
of all the elements that are included within the student data system,
including personally-identifiable student data that gets reported to the
state or federal government. It also requires the state board to
establish rules to comply with state and federal privacy laws, including
FERPA, which is the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act,
which is used nationally with regard to student data privacy of
education records. Those rules would include restrictions on who could
access the personally-identifiable student data in the student data
system, and the list in the statute reflects the sort of requirements in
FERPA of educational professionals who need access. It would also
prohibit transferring that data unless it is otherwise allowed by law or
rule or policy that’s been established. It next requires the state board
to develop a data security plan for the student data system which would
cover access, privacy compliance and audit process, planning for breach…</p>

<p id="20:00">
in the policy for data retention and disposition. It requires the
department, the State Board, to establish a policy for compliance by the
Department of Instruction in those laws, including compliance audits. It
would require that contracts which govern the student data system and
databases, which include student data that are outsourced to private
vendors, would have express provisions safeguarding privacy and security
and would include noncompliance penalties for breaches. And then finally
it requires notification to the Governor and the General Assembly when
new student data is being included and added to the existing data
collection. Finally, part 1 does prohibit collection of four items about
the student or the student's family from being stored in the student
data system. Those are biometric information, political affiliation,
religion, and voting history. Part 2 of the bill is requirements for the
local school school administrative units. It would require local boards
of education to provide annual notice to parents through some means
designed to provide actual notice on parental rights under both federal
and state law regarding student records in the opt-out opportunities
provided for directory information under FERPA and for surveys that are
covered under the Protection of People Rights amendment at the federal
level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. So since the 1970's FERPA has been the guiding document for
how we protect student data and it was designed for a school system in
the 1970's. And so what we're wanting to do, as a state, is make sure
that we have the proper protections in place. FERPA has been changing on
the federal level and so we want to make sure that North Carolina can
continue to move forward the way we have but with proper protections in
place. Most of what you see here in this bill is not out of line with
current policies and procedures within the Department of Public
Instruction. North Carolina has maintained a good rating when it comes
to how we protect students' data because of our relationship to our
research universities and other people that help us crunch numbers. We
have been one of the front-runners in designing the type of contracts
that it takes to do that but as we progress, mainly with the
implementation of Power School, which is the student-wide data system,
as we progress with putting more information online, and I when I say
online I mean on the computers, when we do that we need to make sure
we've got the right things in place when we share it. And that's what
this bill seeks to do, is it beefs up the parental notification. It
allows parents to make a decision about whether they want to opt-out of
optional surveys that are delivered to the students and it makes sure
that all the contracts we have with private contractors that we use
within the Department of Education and LEA's, and even at the school
level have good contracts in place for data that is personally
identifiable and I recommend the bill to you and I'll answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Pate[??] do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Barefoot, is there any fiscal impact that
has been noted for this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is not and part of the reason for that is because under FERPA the
local school districts are already supposed to be providing notice. And
so this puts the force of the statute behind it and it also requires
them to provide an opt-out. There a survey that is done optionally that
is required by the Center for Disease Control that asks questions that
have, I think, become questionable for young children and it gives the
parents the ability to opt-out of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Tarte, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Barefoot, quick question. Do you know
as, well setting this up, cyber security is obviously one of the top
issues of the state CIO and it's an issue they're addressing. Are we
coordinating so we adopt a single set of standards and a single set of
tools around protecting electronic data and would DPI be part of that
solution?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So much of what DPI does is govern by FERPA. And, just so you know, the
CIO has to sign off. So when these contracts are done the state CIO, the
buck stops with him at the end of the day. He has to sign off on what we
call MOU's, or Memorandums of Understanding, between the Department of
Public Instruction and, say, Duke University for example.</p>

Senator Brown: Mr. Chairman?
Mr. Chairman: Thank you Senator Brown, do you have a questions?
Senator Brown: No, I would just like [xxx] favorable report in proper
time
Mr. Chairman: Great, thank you. Are there any further questions? Senator
Raven?
Senator Raven: Yes, thank you Senator Barefoot. I’m just… I think that
the privacy of all of us and the students are important. Are there
penalties for people who breach that and commit some sort of…that
divulge or use embodied in this? Or, do we just say it is a bad thing to
do?
Speaker: So, if this law passes, they would be in violation of both
Verpa, which there are some penalties that come with that, and the state
law. We have not specified penalties. We believe that we should give
some flexibility in that, but, I can tell you, based on my research,
based on the people I have talked to, the biggest penalty will be losing
access to the data for the ones that do this. Duke University comes to
mind: they have been a partner of the states for many years. They use it
to do a lot of the educational research that we ask for, studies on both
students and teachers. It would be detrimental to them to lose that
relationship, but we do provide for that in the bill.
Mr. Chairman: Thank you. Seeing no further questions, we do have a
motion: this motion will be favorable to the PCS, unfavorable to the
original bill. Any discussions? Seeing none. All in favor say aye.
[Congregation: Aye]
Mr. Chairman: Opposed, nae? The aye’s have it. PCS is passed. Thank you.
And our third bill here today is Senate Bill 812. We do have Senator
Tillman to go up and discuss this. Senator Tillman, you have the floor.
Senator Tillman: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I have some technical
amendments that we have to offer and I would like to have the sergeant
in arms pass these out.
Mr. Chairman: Great. As he is passing out the amendment, this is a PCS,
so if we could have a motion to adopt the PCS. All those in favor say
aye.
[Congregation: aye]
Mr. Chairman: All opposed, nay. The aye’s have it. The PCS is before you
and we do have the amendment being passed out. Senator Tillman, if you
could, it’s pretty self explanatory, well not self explanatory, but
pretty simple. If you could explain that while we are passing this out
and then see if we have any questions.
Senator Tillman: Dr. Pierce has worked with me diligently as have the
rest of the staff. I would like her to explain these technical
amendments. One of them may not be so technical but let’s let her
explain them.
Dr. Pierce: Thank you Senators. If you will look at your version of the
PCS, that will also help to understand the amendment. So, in your PCS,
if you will look on page 2, at line 13, the amendment would change the
number of members that the President pro tim of the Senate would appoint
to the academic standards review commission from the overall number
would go from 9 to 11. So then on page 2, line 14, we would go from 3
members that the Senate would appoint, to 4 members. And then if you
would look on line 24, of page 2, the number of members that the Speaker
of the House would appoint, will go from 3 to 4. And then if you look on
the PCS, on line 42, we would delete the line that says that the members
of the commission have to be citizens of North Carolina. Then on page 3
of the PCS, lien 15, and this is to coordinate with now that we have 11
members on the commission instead of 9, the [??corum??] would go to 7.
So that’s why we are substituting the word 7 for 9. Also, on page 3,
line 35, we would rewrite that lien to read just by adding the word
“upon,” that was a technical error on my part because I forgot and put
“up on the following report” And then finally, on page 4, line 16, there
are some examples of different nationally norm assessments that the
state could consider, and just to add another example…</p>

ITBS which is the Illinois test of basic skills so those would be all of
the amendments to the..
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I believe that’s Iowa test of basic skills.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Oh I’m sorry, Iowa not Illinois.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Illinois didn’t think of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Senator Tillman do you have any comments on
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] No I think they’re self explanatory Mr. Chairman. I
move that we adopt these amendments and include them in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Any questions or discussion on the amendment? Senator
Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] A couple questions. Are you not concerned about the
overweighting of the president pro tempore and speaker versus the
governor? I mean typically the three, instead of four shouldn’t we have
three three and three so that there’s balance here?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You can make this bill say anything you want to and you
know the governor could have five or six. No, I think the bill’s just
right the way it is that’s the reason we wrote it this way Senator
Stein, but if you have an amendment you want to take or on the floor
I’ll listen.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up question. I know that North Carolina doesn’t
have citizens but is there a reason why that sentence was deleted?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes, if we did leave that in there how would you verify
whether a person that walks in is a citizen? We don’t have the
capability, and first there US citizens. We didn’t need that at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Any further questions or comments on the amendment?
Seeing none, all in favor of the amendment say aye. Opposed no. The ayes
have it and the PCS as amended is before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Briefly I will tell you how we got to this point. Over
the last six months I’ve been working with tea party, liberal left, with
the exceptions in this room, chamber, governor, best North Carolina,
state superintendent, state board, and you name it. We’ve been around my
table in my office and we’ve gone back and forth and we’ve come up with
some very good strong suggestions from all of those bodies and I think
we’ve come as close as we can to agreement. I don’t think you’ll hear
any big disagreement today. There may be an amendment that we will look
at on the floor, I don’t know, I’ve got to study that. I’m sure there’s
some merit in it at first glance but didn’t have time to study it enough
with this session today. I did not go out looking to change common core.
First heard about it, I heard what could be wrong with national
standards? It’s going to help recruit businesses right? Yeah sure,
national standards would be good but then I got to thinking folks, we
ought to own our own standards and can we make more rigorous standards?
Absolutely. And Jerry Tillman and Dan Soucek’s name would not be on this
bill if it were weakening standards. I spent forty years trying to raise
them in school systems and in schools. Never ever wanted to lower
standards, I wanted to increase them, I still do. There are a lot of
flaws in the common core, the idea was worthy but I believe North
Carolina can do a better job with a bona fide standards commission that
can take a look at what ought to be our standards and our assessments
and make them, number one applicable to North Carolina, and number two
rigorous enough that you can recruit any business or industry to this
state without one single problem and I don’t want to go against any of
the business community because their aims and objectives are good. But
in all of that it kept coming to me, at first from the right, and then
from the soccer moms, wait a minute there’s some things we don’t like
about this. Well tell me about it because I was sort of gullible enough
to believe they were the end all and be all of everything but when you
study them enough, and some of the very groups that are supporting these
did not know what these national standards were, it sounded like a good
idea and so quickly adopted that as our ??? for the state of North
Carolina. I think we can do better, that’s what this bill attempts to
do, and I’ve worked with all the bodies concerned and we’ll continue to,
but I will stop there and see if there’s any comments or questions Mr.
Chairman it’s back in your lap.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Senator Tillman. Do we have any questions? I
see Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The North Carolina common course of study which is what
it’s called under current law gets reevaluated every five years and by
everyone’s assessment the current standards are substantially more
rigorous than the prior standards..</p>

year two of a five year cycle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Finishing year two or finishing year three?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We, the cycle will happen in it's due course. My question to you is, I
hear on the floor when we debated the budget that teachers are the most
important people to educating our children in school. The quality of the
teacher there makes all the difference in the world. Teachers have
invested a couple of years to learn a new way of teaching to higher
standards and this is confirmed both by poll data, which shows 78-82% of
the teachers endorse it, but also anecdotally. Every teacher I've talked
to. My kids are, all three, in public schools. I ask the teachers, I ask
the other teachers in the school and they all say that it allows them to
teach deeper and so that kids have a better understanding. Teachers are
under so much duress and stress right now. Why are we creating a whole
layer of uncertainty in to our public schools at a time when they hadn't
gotten enough pay increases, they have to few teacher assistants, all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do I have a question here somewhere?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm getting there. And that question is, is why are we introducing
uncertainty that destabilizes education and the business community when
it's totally unnecessary and we've got a process by which we will
revisit this a year from now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I think we're doing this for the same reasons that Tennessee is
getting out, Indiana's out, five or six states didn't get in to start
with because we outta own our own standards. We ought not farm that out
to a national conglomerate of anybody. I think we need to own our
standards. This will be back in our hands. Yet, in two years we'll have
the five year cycle of review coming up. This stuff may dovetail just
perfectly with that but the commission won't start until
September/October. It'll be December or January before they make
recommendations. So in the meantime, you've got to take what you've got
and make the best of it. Yes, a lot of work and energy and time have
been invested on something we should have never got in to to start with
and we did. And I'm about three years late in waking up to the fact that
there's a better way and we can own it. Constitutionally, we ought to
own our standards and this will put them in our hands.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, you were just now shaking your head that the current standards are
more rigorous than the old ones. Why should we have not gotten in to
this in the first place? You just said we shouldn't have gotten in to
the standards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. We're a little bit asleep at the wheel, Senator. Yes, the
standards that we have in place of the other ones are better. They're
not nearly rigorous enough in math and they're totally inappropriate for
the early grades. The math part is flawed from the get-go and if you
talk to math teachers you will know that. I must have been talking to
the other 22% of the teachers, Senator. I'm not hearing what you're
hearing. Maybe it's because they're more conservative in my area, I
don't know, but I do know what I've been hearing and I know I've got 40
years of experience that attunes my ear to what's going on. So, I'm
basing it on people I've talked to on both sides. By the way, your very
liberal state of New York has a two year moratorium on it and they will
get out of common core. It's not just the right. It's not a political
issue to me at all. It's what's right for North Carolina. That's simply
what I'm doing, trying to do there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Tillman. I saw Senator Robinson, you had a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a question but, Senator Tillman, I heard you
say that North Carolina outta do it's own but we're gonna do like other
states and get out. But I think you would admit that North Carolina's
been a leader in terms of what we do and so just because the other
states are getting out doesn't mean that that's evidence for us. So my
question here is, have we heard from advocates and are there advocates
in the audience, Mr. Chair, that we are going to hear from later. If
not, I've got another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, we do have some people who are going to be speaking with us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're gonna hear from them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, and the follow-up question, Senator Tillman, because I think that
we're certainly interested and we want businesses to come here but the
key issue ought to be academic achievement of children and what will do
that. So can you point out a few of the flaws. I heard some early, as we
started, too, but I heard that we would have time to work through those
and this would give us time to really evaluate. But I've heard, since
then, from teachers and all that say every couple years you all keep
changing the standards and we can never get adapted to anything to help
to make education better to teach kids. So can you point a couple of
those key flaws?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We spent months with the only subject that we covered was Common Core
with the LRC committee. They had a room committee and we had everybody
to speak for and against. All that testimony is on the record.</p>

The overwhelming evidence that we’ve got that we need to have a change.
So, both committees House and Senate sent this forward to the
legislative for the bill that we recommend. Now the House defers the
matter somewhat as expected. There are many flaws in it and I just told
you some - the mass standards are totally too weak on the upper levels
and they are inappropriate and too difficult for the younger kids. That
needs total revamping but any decision that's made henceforth will be
dependent upon the standards commission to recommend to the state board
of education. And now not be our standard for North Carolina. In the
bill it says, to make a rigorous or more rigorous than any in the
nation. We are wanting some rigorous North Carolina standards and it
will be, I think a high level of standards that you will get from this
commission, I have faith that it will work much better than the
conglomerate of the 50 States. I have always been a little reluctant to
take somebody's yield national effort and think it will do any good, I
have seen too many fails. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to hear a little bit from some other
people in public and then we have got a few senators. Do have some
questions but someone in the public that would like to comment on this
bill, this PCS. And please state your name and who are you with and 2
minutes please. Your microphone is not on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon I’m Mark Jule, vice president of North
Carolina association of educators and an instructional coach from
Guilford County School. I’m here to respectfully urge you not to repeal
the North Carolina common course standards. Our educators are in the
third year of implementing this college and career ready guidelines. Our
common course state standards are providing a regress training work for
class room teachers. These standards were not restrictive and never
meant to be wrote common plays nor were they meant to be live with
creativity of our classroom teachers. The common course state standards
are just that, they are standards, they are designed to bring clarity to
the work done across our state and across our country. And a recent
state wide independent survey conducted by Greenberg, Quinwin and ??
research. 77% of teachers support these standards. They are helping
students to develop better critical thinking and problem solving skills.
Just this morning I received a message from J.N. Halt, a ?? middle
school arts teacher in ??. She states &quot;I’m very concerned about the
possibility of north Carolina reverting back to state standards. After 2
years, I’m beginning to see my teachers were into analyzed text more
clearly and deliberately. Please let me know what I can do to keep North
Carolina common course standards. We hear these comments every day. To
embrace strong standards is critical and supporting teachers who
implement these standards are key to North Carolina's economic success.
Please do what is right for our 1.5 million students, let's keep then
globally competitive in ever-changing, fast paced workforce environment.
Resilient students and resilient teachers who will keep our world class
public school system competitive and continue to move north Carolina
forward are provided with you the key  findings independent research for
your review. Please reconsider this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Yes, please state your name and who you
with and 2 minutes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am Kim Fank and I didn't know there was gonna be an
opportunity to speak publicly so I am speaking of the cough. I am the
chairman watchdog of the coastal Carolina tax press association. I have
flooded all of you emails for the last 8 months. On reasons and data and
research and pictures of homework and a difference between standards and
 curriculum, the thing that makes me the angriest is national standards
do not belong in an individual state. What about sovereignty, what about
the constitution. If you look at what's being fine without parental
approval, without legislative approval; what authority has been given to
the parents over the control of their own kids. We are succeeding for
control of our education system to the chamber of commerce in the big
business entities in the groups of these private public partnerships.
Looking at the standards I have looked at the standards. What most
people have a look at is appendix B. Appendix B includes the methods of
teaching the math.</p>

I forgot, it’s not curriculum. It also mentions the fact that there are
suggested book readings but you guys don’t know about that. But not just
the book, it’s not the whole book. It’s the page, the chapter and then
an assigned task. But, oh yeah, that’s not curriculum and then you hear
that the teachers aren’t using it. It’s bullcrap, people. We need to
keep North Carolina, North Carolina and forget what the big businesses
say, these are our children. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please, I know this has been an emotional issue, but
please know outbursts of noise like that, it’s not proper in this
committee meeting. But thank you. One thing we did when we had to start
a commission with ?? we had long discussion, lots and lots of
interaction and a very long public comment period as well. I did wanna
give a small opportunity from the public as well. We did hear one for
and one against, but you wanna go back to the senders. As we’re running
out of time, I have vote. Senator Bryant, Senator Tarte, Senator Graham
and Senator Davis as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chair. I had one question, I think a
comment. I need to understand the timeline, the sort of process we’re
creating here. So, Senator Tillman, correct me if I’m wrong and add when
I’m missing. We’re creating this Standards Commission that will convene
in September and maybe make a report by the end of the year to the State
Board who still can’t decide what standards we have. And amongst the
standards, they can consider or including the common core standards are
completely out of consideration, regardless and then when will the
teachers have to change what they’re doing. So, I’m sort of asking 3
questions. Do I have this preliminary process correct? When it gets to
state board, what is their authority to kick his common core still on
the table or does this bill say, regardless of what information we get
from any sources out and thirdly, when do the teachers have to then
change what they’re now doing and the status quo reign until some change
is implemented. Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, you’ve got the process and the
timeline about right. A board will be named by the naming bodies. The
governor and legislature – house and senate and this bill becomes
effective July 1st. Common core standards are removed and repealed as of
July 1st. This committee will meet, be named and start working in
September, they work in department administration and they will review
standards and any standards that we have or any that we need are all
subject to be the topics of discussion for this standards commission
anyway can be recommended to the state board. Nothing’s out, Nothing’s
in. It’s ours and not theirs, is the main thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Follow up, Mr. Chair. So what course of study
are we using when kids go back to school in August of this year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Standard course of study is what we’ve always used and
that’s what we’ll continue to use until we have changes recommended and
approved by the State Board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more follow up. So that standard course of study
now includes the common core standards. Am I missing something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Common core standards are a part of the standards that
we’re operating under now and those can be rejected and ?? in part,
whatever. It’s up to the standards commission. That will be doing it and
putting North Carolina’s brand on it. They may take some, all or none of
the current standards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, what I’d like you to do is, read
section 6 on page 4. Let me go to the other Senators, they may answer
your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tarte, do you have a question? Thank You,
Senator Graham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s more of a comment than a question in reference to
this. My concern is the ?? ?? any consistency in policy. We put a policy
in place. We gotta ?? and then we change the policy. We got standards up
to the place for 3 years now, teachers are working to watch them. We got
a ?? too, now we change them. So ?? further your bill and the charter
school, we put up a process in place, we got a ?? too we change them.
There doesn’t seem to be any consistency in policy. That leads to
confusion in reference to education for me, per se. So, I’m voting
against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You decide what kind of policy changes you want to
make on ?? you make it 2 or 3. I don’t make policy that way senator, so
your allegation of that in both the charter and in common core bill are.</p>

False. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman,
at the appropriate time, I’d like to move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Noted. I do see Senator Stein and Senator Daniel did
have questions. Let’s listen to those two questions. Senator Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Tillman, I think I
want to follow up on Senator Bryant’s line of inquiry. You said that
effective July 1, those standards are repealed and removed and we
default back to the North Carolina course of study. Are you talking
about the standards that we had three years ago, or are you saying the
North Carolina course of study remains in effect until which time this
commission has made recommendations to the state board which then makes
changes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s my understanding. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Tillman, I guess my question… following up on
Senator Graham’s question, is it accurate to say that in the past, North
Carolina has always designed its own standards, and what’s different
about the common core is we’ve now all of a sudden tried to adopt some
national standard? And I think that’s, at least in my mind, one of the
things that’s different about the policy direction that we’re going in
at this time and why the change is necessary. I applaud you for your
efforts to get back to North Carolina designing its own standards for
our own students. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Senator Woodard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Senator Tillman, I think I heard you say something I just want
to verify. You said that this study committee could come back and
recommend none, some or all of the common core standards, so is it
possible then that we could be right back where we are? If they come
back and recommend all the standards, we have common core back in place?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, Mr.
Chairman. Senator, that won’t happen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You did say
“all” though. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It could be, but listen: That committee,
that standards commission, will put it in North Carolina’s hands. If
common core was such a great idea, they’d have a test for it, would they
not, so we could compare how we’re doing. We’ve been into this thing for
two or three years and where are we? We have no national test and you
won’t have one. There’ll be no comparison between state to state. We’ll
have that with this standards commission, so I think I trust them. I
trust them to do this thing right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So when you said “all”, you
misspoke then. They will never recommend all the common core standards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t think so but they can do anything they want
to. It’ll be ours and not theirs; that’s all I’m saying. Whatever they
recommend and the state board approves and we approve, we’ll have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Final question will be from Senator Rabon, and then
I’ll hear Senator Wade’s motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m more into the
comment mode because comments are being made. When I started down
personally this trail, common core were guidelines. Now I’m hearing that
common core are standards, and the right solution I believe is the
direction we’re going right now. If the state gives up what are the
standards and what are we doing, then the next thing that comes down on
us here is not only the standard here; it’s how you do it and then what
you teach, and what we teach, the curriculum and the standards, should
be best for North Carolina, not best for somebody else. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Cook. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a
quick comment. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You microphone’s not on. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It’s not working? I’ve had several town halls on this, and the
vast preponderance, and these were big groups of folks come to talk,
were against common core, so it’s not just a little one or two phone
calls; there’s a lot of folks out there who are really displeased about
this, and I’m thanking ?? and Jerry for bringing this forward. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well thank you. We do have a motion from Senator Wade. If I
believe, your motion is a PCS as amended rolled into a new PSCS with
favorable to a new PCS and unfavorable to the original bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Exactly, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that
motion. And all in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed, no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
ayes have it and the motion passes, and that concludes out time today.
Thank you very much for your attendance.</p>
