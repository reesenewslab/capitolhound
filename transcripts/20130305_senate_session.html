27,000 people have died from accidental drug overdoses in 2007. In 16
states overdose deaths exceeded automobile fatalities.  These numbers
may shock you as it did me when we got the data on this also.  Drug
overdose is the number 2 injury related killer of young adults ages 15
to 34.  Noxalone is a drug that provides life-saving respiratory
stimulation. It is given as a nasal or syringe form by prescription.
This bill administers ?? immunity from prosecution for individuals who
contact authorities with an overdose and limited immunity for
administering or prescribing Noxalone. The Sheriff’s Association we have
worked several weeks with them to get them comfortable with this bill.
Also the Medical Society is fine with this. And most of these drug
overdoses, these youth are dead before first responders ever get there.
Mr. President , if I may, I will conclude my comments and allow if
Senator Allran to for this amendment.  If you wish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran, you can have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. The amendment is on everyone’s desk if you’ll
take a look at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I didn’t realize we were putting forth an amendment here. I
thought you were just going to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I handed it for already but it hasn’t been read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do all the members have copies of the amendment? We do? Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. The addition that you have on your desk
provides that Nolaxone can be prescribed, dispensed and distributed.
Nolaxone is an FDA approved drug, it’s a regulated drug but it is not a
controlled drug. But because it’s a regulated drug it does require
prescription to dispense by federal law. The use of the term, or, in the
original term that’s on your desk might indicate that it could be
dispensed without a prescription being written, and the amendment
removes the word dispensed or distributed, from the bill to clarify that
the practitioner must still prescribe the bill. That’s what the
amendment does and I urge your support.
Thank you Senator, is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage f Amendment 1. All
in favor will vote aye, oppose will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting.  The clerk will record the vote. Apodaca, aye.
50 having voted in the affirmative and zero in the negative. Amendment 1
is adopted and the bill as amended is back before the body.

Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, when a company is
looking to locate a business they look at the crime rate and the overall
quality of life in our communities. In 2007, Wilkes County ranked the
third worse in the nation for drug overdoses. After the implementation
of the Lazarus Project, Wilkes county has seen a 69% drop in overdoses
from 2009 to 2011.  And I would like to read you the mission statement
of the Lazarus Project.  Lazarus, excuse me, Project Lazarus utilizes
experience, data and compassion to empower communities and individuals
to prevent drug overdoses. Provide effective substance abuse treatment
and meet the needs of those living with chronic pain. The U.S. Army at
Fort Bragg dispenses Nolaxone to active duty officers and their families
for overdose rescues.  And the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian
reservation does for their residents. So I ask your support on this
legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Allran, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on behalf of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to say simply that the only point of this piece of
legislation is to save lives. Anyone can become addicted to prescription
drugs.  The drugs that were made.</p>

What we'll be talking about in this bill, which are painkillers or
opiates are very widely available in our society. Startling available
and highly addictive. As Senator Bingham pointed out, in the United
States the number one cause of accidental deaths is prescription drug
overdosing. It's number two in North Carolina, after automobile
accidents, but if we don't do something about it that's going to change.
We discussed this bill very thoroughly in the J2 committee and it got a
resounding, unanimous vote out of the J2 committee. The sheriff spoke on
behalf of it, the Psychiatrist is in favor of it, medical folks are in
favor of it, the military, the Indian reservations, and the Project
Lazarus author that Senator Randleman referred to as a minister. Quite
frankly, I'm not sure if anybody has yessed this bill and I urge your

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Hartsell's recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, the bill comes from the
administrative procedure oversight committee. It is designed to create
and identify or deal with a situation where an applicant or a license
with a criminal record, applies for such an occupational license that in
the law that does not provide that that record, or that conviction is a
specific automatic disqualifier. That the licensing board must consider
these factors, that are identified in the bill, when making this
decision on the license application. So far as I'm aware there is no
opposition to this bill. In fact, it's been endorsed by a number of . .

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I'd like to thank my
co-sponsors, Senator Kinnaird and Senator Goolsby for their work with me
and with the J2 committee on this bill. We have a principle that the
expungement process exists to give people who have made mistakes, early
in life in a non-violent way, who were convicted of a non-violent crime
to have their record expunged and therefore have better access to
employment and other educational opportunities. This bill builds on that
premise by prohibited employers and educational institutions from
inquiring about an expunged crime that an individual may have had
removed from their record. In the context of an employment situation,

thank you so, ladies and gentlemen, the Senate and many of you that were
involved in the but meeting the corruption of power is a excellent job
in explaining this bill and for some of you are however briefly, what it
means. every year the General assembly after the federal government and
Congress decides to make a federal law check tax changes out. we usually
appease your following on decide whether we either comply. we need to
agree with it or did the couple or not to agree with it, and so
therefore we are here again, thanks to Congress of making decisions
about the two thousand and twelve cashier waiting to live letter to the
half the twelfth hour, but basically, January second two thousand and
thirteen, making federal tax changes on it delayed us that there are a
number of problems. hours that are anxiously waiting to decide how to
best put in their tax returns and a lot of communes and attorneys are
waiting for also this bill, so hopefully today and tomorrow will get
this passed. so they can move out and provide clarity to the runs filing
taxes, and when preparing the object of this year was to minimize the
general fund impact as much as possible as is been done in the past.
that's number of years are the same time minimizing the complexity for
taxpayers and for the Department of revenue. just as an example, there
are already five hundred thousand tax rate of tax returns in place
today. and some of them will have to be readjusted because of the fact
that the Congress was so late in the end, preparing upcoming phone of
these tax changes so that we tried to do I know well through this yet is
so is basically deciding run. if it was sad possible for us to afford
ease and second, that if the changes were that were made were so complex
that it would require us to go back and have evaluated two thousand
twelve in January to come forward with the necessary tax information and
it would be almost requiring them to have two sets of books. to do so.
so those are the decisions as to how we made it in the decision came
down, so that when we ended up doing was the bonus depreciation enhance
section one seventy nine. we chose been the couple goes to bat does not
mean the businesses don't take advantage of this,what it means is that
it will be depreciated over a longer period of time in fifteen</p>

impact in the general fund of the first year was twenty five million

they would be sufficient amount of dollars for us to meet our needs in

difficult circumstances you more so as he says in five years because of
the very light date on which Congress chose to ask change VRC in the
limited amount of time that that's given us your North Carolina two to
respond that I appreciate the hard work that they have done and not
politically young appeal together on as I thought about the build over
the weekend I I I took a look again at some of the particular things,
shows to do and reflected on the fact that a lot of the provisions that
we are in this bill as proposed, choosing not to conform to not follow
are really useful tools in the present economy to support the additional
job creation and support working families in the present economy as we
continue to labor to get out of the Dutch and I I* took a different view
that although the latest troubles me as a dozen Araujo still think some
of the decisions were made by Congress, or are good onesfor our state
and so I offer for your consideration. remember that would strike a
somewhat different balance about what will how we following how we
conform to the Internal Revenue Code, let me say I will expand amendment
and you should also have a physical memorandum apparently none that I
will also discuss but let me also say that the IV was original
completely that we don't need to be in the as you make changes that
would be retroactive to twenty twelve, and require you to avoid file the
returns to graphical back and amend the return of withdrawing refile
return. so, the amendment does not believe that I just like the basic
building, said Araujo explained to you all the amendment does, or
forward-looking changes that would be for the present tax year. I'm
going for out where it differs from him. I has to lead to is in the
following respects and if you've got the amendment now I'll tell you
where those RC can follow and if you are relate back to the Maysville,
you can do that online. as the first of the changes made and what the
that amendment portion. remember does is it conforms fully to what
Congress did on the extension of the work opportunity tax credit. it
does not lower the rate as the bill proposes to do from six percent to
three</p>

<p id="30:00">
&quot;Just a refresher about what that work opportunity tax credit does,
is it provides employers with a tax credit or a tax incentive for hiring
difficult to place employees. Folks coming off of welfare, if your
hiring somebody off of the welfare roles. Or hiring an ex felon who's
just been discharged from prison. Congress says it's important to try
and get employers to do that and gives a tax credit for that. What the
amendment purposes to do is to follow and conform under state tax code
to that provision that supports the jobs creation for difficult to
employee people. The second thing the amendment does, it starts on line
3 of the amendment and runs through line 9. Again what that does is
addresses the problem that congress saw with the continuing difficulty
we have with the foreclosure situation as people are being foreclosed or
they're engaging in short sales and then saddled with enormous
forgiveness of debt which they have to pay income tax on because it's
treated as income when the debt is discharged. Congress has said that we
ought to allow some slack to those folks who are dealing with
foreclosures and short sales and not require them to treat that
discharge of debt as income. So what the amendment proposes to do is to
continue to conform the internal revenue code on that, in other words
North Carolina would do the same thing the feds are doing but it does
make one change that is different from the federal change. The amendment
would cap the amount of the indebtedness that could be thus excluded
from income at 250,000 dollars. The feds go all the way to 2 million
dollars. That's a rather expensive house. If you're getting 2 million
discharged on your mortgage that's a pretty hefty sum. So the amendment
limits that in order to keep the fiscal impact of the amendment down to
250,000 worth of discharge income. The third thing the amendment does
and fourth thing, it does two things and they're all shown on line 11.
The deletion that's proposed on line 11 affects two provisions of the
base bill. The first of those is that it would continue conforming to
the internal revenue code which allows you to exclude or deduct amounts
you pay for mortgage insurance premiums. Again to try to support the
housing industry, to try and support families who are dealing with
difficult situations who's lenders are now saddling them with high
mortgage insurance premiums because of the credit situation. So again
it's supportive of the housing industry and of homeowners who are trying
to make their mortgage payments.By continuing to conform to the internal
revenues code allowance of that deduction. Second thing that line of the
amendment does is it's full conformity on the earned income tax credit.
Unlike the tax bill it does not reduce the tax rate or the state tax
credit from 5 percent to 4 and a half percent. It conforms to the
federal extension of the 5 percent earned income tax credit in North
Carolina. So the last thing that this amendment does is it pays for
those things. I'll talk in a minute on the fiscal memo on where we
bottom out. Here's how it pays for it. That starts on line 13 and
continues down to line 24 of the amendment. In the last session we
enacted a tax benefit that we were told was to support small business
job creation. That tax benefit was to allow employers to exclude from
state taxable income for the first 50 thousand dollars of income. All
taxpayers could exclude the first 50 thousand dollars worth of business
income. That again was sold to us as a way to support small businesses
in job creation efforts. Some supported that amendment, so supported
that legislation some did not support that legislation. What the
amendment does is it caps eligibility for that 50 thousand dollar
exclusion at tax payers whose incomes are less than a million dollars.
In other words, what the amendment says that if you make more than a
million dollars taxable income in North Carolina, you don't get that 50
thousand dollar small business exclusion, if you make more than a
million dollars. That's the last thing the amendment does, members
should have a fiscal memo that gives you the cost of those items and the
revenue changes on each of those items in the amendment. All I'm going
to do unless there are questions, Mr. President, is give you the bottom
line. If you want to look at the fiscal memo on the amendment, what it
shows is the cost of this amendment in the first year is just at 9
million dollars less...&quot;

million dollars more than the bill that was put on the floor this
afternoon. For the biennium for which we did opt in a two year biennial
budget in the next month or two, the total cost of this amendment is
$38.7 million dollars. The total cost of the bill is $42 million
dollars. Over the next biennium the amendment cost the state of North
Carolina about three million dollars less than the bill that's on the
floor, and in the out years that continues so in each subsequent year
the differential cost is about three million dollars less.
I misspoke, my apologies, my great apologies to all of you, I gave you
the wrong number in the amendment on the $50,000 exclusion. It goes away
over $500,000 dollars, not over a million, my apologies. We;re trying to
get the numbers to balance and we were working very hard on getting the
numbers to balance, they balance at $500,000 dollars so the exclusion
goes away over $500, 000 of net taxable income in North Carolina. My
apologies in the explanation.
Mr. President that's a short statement of the amendment. Again, I think
the amendment by and large conforms to an awful lot of the more
important provisions that senator Rucho covered with you, but the four
adjustments that we make I would urge you to consider because I think
they do support working families. Families struggling with housing
problems, they support the housing industry and they support job
creation.
And they cost something to some tax payers, they cost - they're about
seven to ten thousand taxpayers in this state of nine million people who
might pay more because they won't get a tax benefit we gave them two
years ago. I think its a fair balance, it's a good balance for the
state's bottom line in terms of state budget. And I hope you'll give
favorable consideration of the amendment. Thank you Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Rucho. Senator Tucker for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the amendment's sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clodfelter do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a quick one. So, if we vote for your amendment
the tax decrease that we had two years ago, we're going to voting for a
tax increase on people making over $500,000 dollars a year. So this is a
tax increase?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You will remove - yes Senator Tucker. You will remove
the benefit that those people got two years ago, you would also though
be granting tax relief to a lot of people who make less than $500,000
dollars. The amendment gives tax relief to a lot of folks who make less
than that amount.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, just so I'm clear I'm voting on a tax increase if
I vote for the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're also voting for some tax decreases.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clodfelter you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, you've done a lot of good work on
what is a complicated area, but let's talk about a few of these issues.
Let's talk about the WOTC credit where again, talking about going from
6% to 3% t make it revenue neutral. And something else that everyone
here needs to know is that some of these issues will be impacted when
tax reform comes forward at some point during a session, and so what we
need to do is be sure that the numbers add up and also that we're also
standing on the principals that we have in regard to tax reform.
Let's talk about WOTC credit, urban bookings tax policy sent out a
report on the WOTC program and basically came out and said there was no
meaningful increase in the employment of disadvantaged as it contributed
to the WOTC. And secondly, there also is a situation where we believe
that a person should have the opportunity based on having the skills
rather than just the opportunity of the fact that they could get a
credit. So in essence the employer would try to choose someone who is
prepared and qualified to do that.
Secondly,talking about the mortgage insurance as an interest, mortgage
insurance encourages people to purchase too much house and enters
mortgages beyond their means, which is something that we're presently
trying to work our way out of. That is why in 2009 we started all of
this problem because of the fact programs like this ended up causing
people to go beyond their limits as to what they could afford, and more
importantly they didn't have enough to put...</p>

<p id="40:00">
Down payments on, we would rather encourage responsible lending and
responsible borrowing and thirdly it's also the fact that it's not
interest, it's actually paying the mortgage insurances and it does not
actually help reduce the service so if we are moving in that direction,
we should also provide exemption for home owner insurance. The other
part about it is the exclusion for the discharge of the resident ??,
again another program that the federal government put forward that
allows for as a result turns out to be responsible real estate lending
and again that's why we are in this recession that we can't seem to get
out of. We actually see some light at the end of the tunnel and we don't
believe that we would like to continue that trend down to a responsible
lending and borrowing. And then the last piece of our earned income tax
credit, just some facts about this program, It was started many years
ago in the federal government but let's talk about a couple of issues,
in 2009 the ?? was studied came out and evaluated this program (EIC) and
between 25 and 33 percent there was a a fraudulent rate. In 2006 the ??
a 30.6 percent worse in proper payments and even as the IRS estimates
between 23 and 28 percent fraud as of 2011. If you compare that program
to other programs that are part of the ?? study it talks about other
improper payments like medicare 3.6, Social security (SSI) 8.2, Food
stamps 4.4 but EITC is 30.4 percent. The system is out of control. It
does us no good to continue doing something similar to what we had with
the medicare situation. You want to be sure that the money is used
wisely and apparently on a federal level 23 to 28 percent and some would
have about between 11 and 13 billion dollars an year of cost due to
fraud. Ladies and gentleman of the senate, I appreciate Senator Carl
Ford for bringing this forward but I'd say to you that this bill needs
to pass and I say you defeat the amendment and move on to passing the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Senator McKissick, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With all due respect Senator Ruth's statements aside I guess I simply
have to indicate that that I support the amendment. I think it's fair, I
think it's reasonable, I think it's balanced, I think this is what we
need to do as responsible legislatures. And if you think about the
housing collapse the market that occurred in recent years since 2008 the
onslaught of the recession that many individuals that really were not a
part of it, they were lenders that went at there and established there
fair markets, these people just paid what they were at that time. And
unfortunately there are many people who are upside down in the
mortgageships. Many people who are having a deal with short ?? of their
properties. Many people that are adversely impacted due to the ?? that
or the beyond anything they could control and If you find yourself as an
individual in that particular set of circumstances ?? in fact way this
amendment proposes up to 250 thousand dollars that was cancelled. And I
say up to because it may be 50 thousand, it may be 25 thousand, it may
be 100 thousand up to 250 you would be able to receive ?? of that
cancellation and only on your principle residence. Not about investors,
it's about people who live in those homes who have been adversely
impacted. That's reasonable. Congress thought it should go further,
congress said up to 2 millions. Senator Clark filtered his wisdom, I
think it's a reasonable balance, 250 thousand. And like wise if you are
one of those individuals that's not fortunate enough to have saved up 20
percent down payment, you don't have a gift from a family members
provided to you and you are going with the 10 percent down payment and
you are buying that home for the first time, even the second time, there
are so many individuals are forced to do, are seeked to do, they are
required if they don't have atleast 20 percent down to get the project
mortgage insurance. Congress and it;s ?? has said, it was telling your
principle residence. We are going to allow you to take that as a
deduction the same way you would interest deduction on your principle
residence. That's fair, that's reasonable, that's balanced. You look at
the other components here ?? of income tax when it goes it qualifies for
?? at least among us..</p>

And we oughta try to index it accordingly but try to make sure that we
have something in place as this legislature has done so in the past.
Work force development. We need to have jobs. We want people to be
resourceful. We want employers to receive credits. It strikes a good a
fair a reasonable balance. I would encourage you to support it.
Certainly there’s no panacea. Certainly we could come up many other
variations some of which might be better. Some might be worse. But I
think what we have here compared to the alternatives on the table is far
more fair far more reasonable far more balanced and helps the everyday
person that we have been elected to represent. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask Senator McKissick a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator made a comment that
you did that Congress in its wisdom, I would like to ask you is this the
same Congress in its wisdom that got us into 17 trillion dollars worth
of debt? It is the same Congress we are talking about in’t it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The Congress I’m speaking of was a bi-partisan group that
supported this composed of Republicans and Democrats that thought this
was fair and reasonable. I’m not going to sit there and embrace
everything that this Congress does because there’s many things that this
Congress does that I would respectfully have very serious disagreements
with from time to time. But on this particular issue and we haven’t gone
as far they would go. We’ve tried to strike a balance that’s far more
reasonable far more commiserate with helping that individual that might
be adversely impacted that has that $250,000 in debt on a principle
residence not two million. So I think that Congress understood the
concept that perhaps went a bit too far. But they have in fact tried to
open the door in some areas in a way that we should be sensitive and
responsive too. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein for
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you have to the floor to speak to the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the Senate. There was
a letter that was written by the National Association of Attorneys
General in November to the U.S. Congress. 43 members. About half
Democratic half Republican. And they wrote to urge Congress to pass
legislation extending tax relief for citizens who have mortgage debt
canceled or forgiven because of financial hardship where/g a decline in
housing values. There is a mortgage crisis. Real estate prices have
fallen precipitously in the last four or five years. So it is very
common for people to owe substantially more on there home than it is
worth today. So what lenders are determining is that it’s in the
investors’ interest, the banks interest to go ahead and forgive some of
that principle to make the mortgage more affordable so that the
homeowner can continue to make their monthly payments. That way they
stay in the home. Otherwise this bank has to foreclose on the home.
They’re going to lose substantial amounts of principle because they
can’t sell it at auction for anything more, near what the note is worth.
The purpose is to make people’s lives better so that they can stay in
their homes. That’s why Democrat and Republican Attorney Generals across
the country urged Congress to enact it. In the fiscal cliff negotiations
this provision was added in that bill. It was absolutely not a source of
controversy. Republicans in Congress embraced it just as Democrats in
Congress did. Because they knew we in America have a stake in keeping
people in their homes. By decoupling this provision what you all are
doing is for about 2,000 tax payers in this year Senator Tucker you’re
going to raise taxes on them to the tune of about $5200 because on
average they get about $75,000 in mortgage deduction either to their
note. Or they’ve been foreclosed on and they a deficiency balance. And
the bank says I’m not going to collect that from you. So I can just
write this off, so you can have a clean credit record, and that way your
life can be better and you can start moving on with your life. And maybe
you can become a homeowner again. Well what we’re doing is we’re making
these couple of thousand North Carolinians come up with $5,000 in cash
for $75,000 in paper income. It’s not real dollars cash that they don’t
have. Why else are they struggling? Again this is what the Attorneys
General wrote Democrat Republican. This raises, it creates tax increases
on the very families who can least afford it. So to your point Senator
Tucker this bill that you all are passing unamended is a tax increase.
But the ones you’re raising the taxes on are the families who are
struggling the hardest. And that includes the people with earned income
tax credit. 19%, one out of five</p>
