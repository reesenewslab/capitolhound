to America and offering our continuing support to our soldiers, the
House resolves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Szoka is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I’d ask that the resolution be read in its entirety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas, in 1908, the nation's leaders knew that the most up-to-date
medical experience resided in civilian sector, created the first
reservoir of trained officers in a reserve status, known as the Medical
Reserve Corps; and
Whereas, today over twenty percent of the Army's assets lie within the
Army Reserve; and
Whereas, in 1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act, creating the
Officers' Reserve Corps, the Enlisted Reserve Corps, and the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps, later named the Organized Reserve Corps (ORC),
all of which are forerunners of the current Army Reserve; and
Whereas, in both World Wars, Army Reserve Soldiers answered the call of
duty. In World War I, 89,500 reserve officers were mobilized, and during
World War II, 200,000 members of the ORC participated, with reserve
officers providing twenty-nine percent of the Army's officers; and
Whereas, in both World Wars, Army Reserve Soldiers answered the call of
duty. In 1952, legislation renamed the ORC as the Army Reserve and then
divided it into three reserves: a Ready Reserve, a Standby Reserve, and
a Retired Reserve. Legislation also provided that reserve units have
twenty-four training days and up to seventeen days of annual training;
and
Whereas, the Army Reserve has been an integral part of numerous
conflicts. More than seventy Army Reserve units were deployed in the
Korean Peninsula; well over 120,000 soldiers have provided combat
support and combat service support during Operation Desert Shield/Storm;
and others provided support in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Operation
Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle, and Operation Iraqi Freedom;
and currently over 12,000 Army Reserve soldiers are currently deployed
around the world; and
Whereas, the role of the Army Reserve has changed over time. Moving from
a Strategic Reserve to an Operational Force, the Army Reserve provides
resources and training to first-responder organizations across the
nation, trains soldiers, implements national objectives, keeps the Army
mobile, and enables the Army to do more with constrained resources; and
Whereas, the Army Reserve makes up twenty percent of the Army's
organized units, while providing one half of the Army's combat support
and one fourth of its mobilization-base-expansion capabilities. Now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the House of Representative:
Section 1. The House of Representatives honors the memory of the members
of the United States Army Reserve who have given their lives while
serving our nation.
Section 2. The House of Representatives celebrates the 105th birthday of
the United States Army Reserve, honors its continuing service to
America, and offers the soldiers our thanks and continued support.
Section 3. This resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Szoka is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s my distinct pleasure to speak on this bill
in support of it. The Armed Forces stand there to protect all our
freedoms. The Army, in particular, is a volunteer force made up of three
components, the Active Duty, the Army Reserve, and the National Guard,
all three equally important. It’s particularly important for us to
recognize the Army Reserve today on their 105th anniversary. These are
the citizen soldiers. They’re doing their jobs. For the most part,
driving trucks, being medical technicians, all the things in combat
service support. They’re the ones who are there who come forward when
called in times of nation emergency and national war that leave their
jobs. They come support the Active Duty forces and that are there.
Without the Army Reserve, we would not be able to project the force that
we do overseas, and to fight for our freedoms and to maintain our
freedoms. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve served beside National
Guard and Army Reserve soldiers. Females, males, it really doesn’t
matter because they’re soldiers. They always rise to the occasion. They
do their duty when called upon. And I ask you to support this bill.

In that with the course of others who have spoken and who will speak no
doubt, to congratulate the Army Reserves on their 150th Anniversary. I
was a part of 824th Quarter Masters at Forth Bragg, a rigging outfit
that packed parachutes.
But I can assure you that I did not pack any parachutes, but I did jump
out of planes. I guess y’all could tell that those of you who met me
that I probably bumped my head a couple of times. But I really enjoyed
those at 824the Quarter Masters at Forth Bragg North Carolina.
Comraderie and the times that we’ve had it’s a great time and I know
that you gentleman must be really proud of your contributions. I know I
am. And I just want to commend this resolution to you Mr. Speaker and
thank you for allowing us to celebrate this anniversary date. Thank you
Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker]: Representative Shaw is recognized.
[Representative Shaw]: To speak on resolution Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker]: You're recognized.
[Representative Shaw]: I too want to join in the celebration of the
150th Anniversary of the Army Reserve. When I was invited to join the
army in a few years ago, I got an invitation from the President of The
United States. To ask me to join the army and I did at the time and at
the time he invited me. He even let me stay active for a couple of years
and then let me stay in the reserves for six years after that.
I did two years active reserve duty and the rest of the time was spent
on inactive reserves. But let me tell you what you really have to
understand is that the whole experience gave me the opportunity to
broaden my experiences to the extent that I was able to interact with a
lot of people throughout the world and throughout particularly in the
country.
When I came back off of active duty, and joined the reserves, I spent
those two years in the active reserve with a hospital unit out of Nam.
When we had our little training down in Fort Bragg and even down at Camp
Gordon Georgia. It was a fascinating experience. I was proud to have
been a part of an operation that defended the flag of this country.
I was proud to have been a part of an Army that always served to protect
and defend and even though there was some problems during that time, but
we overcame those problems and now here in this late, late, I’m still
happy for the service that I was able to reserve and for the reserve
duty that I was able to pull. I commend the resolution to you.
[Speaker]: Representative Faircloth is recognized.
[Representative Faircloth]: Speak on the resolution please Sir.
[Speaker]: You’re recognized.
{Representative Faircloth]: Thank you Mr. Speaker and Members of the
House. Some of the most pleasant years that I spent were the 11 years
that I spent in a combination of active and active reserve. I was in the
422nd Civil Affairs Company in Greensboro. A great group of folks and
our company was trained to actually go in and take over a city that
might have been captured and to run that city.
We had all the training and so forth to hold each of the office within a
city government. It was really good education as well as getting chance
to meet some very fine soldiers over that period of time. I guess the
longest 48 hours we spent was during the Cuban missile crisis when we
were wondering whether of not we were going to be managing the City of
Havana shortly.
Fortunately we didn't have to go there. But it is an experience that I
think every young man and now young woman would benefit from to spend
time in the Reserve of the National Guard. It’s giving something to your
country and it gives back a lot to you as an individual. I commend this
resolution to you.
[Speaker]: The gentleman from Macklinburg, Representative Brawley in
recognized.
[Representative Brawley]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. To speak on the
resolution.
[Speaker]: You’re recognized.
[Representative Brawley]: I didn't spend any time in the reserves
because I was regular army and served long enough that I didn't have a
reserve commitment. A lot of my brothers in arms did. Since then the
reserves have continued to serve. I think a lot of people don't realize
just how much they have invested in our freedom. I just pulled up a
listing of the current U.S. Army Reserve Divisions that are fully
staffed and ready to support this country. The 75th, 77th, 78th, 80th,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas, on April 16, 2011, storms produced tornadoes and flooding swept
through North Carolina affecting 30 of the State's 100 counties,
including Bertie, Bladen, Craven, Cumberland, Currituck, Greene,
Halifax, Harnett, Hertford, Hoke, Johnston, Lee, Onslow, Pitt, Robeson,
Sampson, Wake, and Wilson; and whereas a total of 28 tornadoes the most
recorded in state history affected citizens, property, and businesses
across North Carolina; and whereas, the tornadoes caused the deaths of
24 people, half of whom were residents of Bertie County, including:
Louis Chamblee, Gayle Hinchey, Barbara Lafferty, Roy Lafferty, Jr.,
Peggy Leary, Dorothy Mitchell, Robert Perry, Milton Sutton, Mildred
Warren, Celia White, Helen Alston White, and Mary Williams; and whereas,
as one of the hardest hit counties, Bertie County suffered extensive
damage, especially in the surrounding areas in the Town of Colerain; and
whereas, due to the destruction of 67 homes and major damage to 20
others in Bertie County, at least 87 families were displaced; and
whereas, the storm-related damage in Bertie County was over $2.5
million; and whereas, the residents of Bertie County possess a resilient
spirit and quickly came together to help their neighbors after the
storms; and whereas, today, the residents of Bertie County have rebuilt
their homes and businesses and have shown that they can move forward
after a natural disaster; Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House of
Representatives: Section 1. The House of Representatives honors the
memory of the North Carolinians who lost their lives due to the
tornadoes on April 16, 2011. Section 2. The House of Representatives
joins the citizens of Bertie County affected by those tornadoes in
commemorating April 16, 2013, as Bertie County…</p>

?? Section 3, this resolution’s effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of this great House,
it gives me honor and pleasure to recommend this resolution to you. Some
of you were not serving in the legislature during that time, and a
number of the people who were serving, some of those are not here any
longer, but I can ensure whether you’re in the General Assembly or not,
you remember how those tornadoes ravaged North Carolina in 2011. Today
is the exact date that the tornadoes swept through, and I was fortunate
enough to have some of the residents come today, to commemorate and to
remember. Often times we try to forget horrible things but that’s a part
of the healing process, when we remember. So today some of the residents
gave up their time to come and to listen to the resolution that’s been
read and their hearing. One of the young ladies up there, don’t want to
get to personal with her, and I won’t call her name, but during the
storm, she, her mother and children were hubbled together, embracing one
another, and her mother died embracing her during that storm. When I
first got to meet her, she was down in Bertie County, and when I saw her
for the first time to know who I was looking at, she was in a body cast
from neck down. She was still not at home. She was at a church where I
met her. Shortly after that incident, she also lost her father. So she’s
had a lot to endure. When we were meeting in 428 earlier today, she
wanted to say a few words, but she said I don’t want to start crying.
But we know that in times like these and having to try to remember
people who were so close to you, it’s difficult to talk about even now.
She has been restored to another place, but there’s still some healing
that she has to do. She still suffers from the injuries, and she doesn't
feel well all of the time, but she’s still moving about. A number of the
Representatives from Burtie County join us today, and we probably don’t
have all the names because things got kind of hectic prior to getting
here. But one of the former sheriffs spoke today, and he’s talked about
the Sheriff’s Department going out to this particular home that he had
gotten a call to go to, the address. They went out to the address and
the deputy radioed back there’s no house here. We can’t find the house.
Well, you got the address, we’re at the address, but there is no house.
So those are the kinds of things that they had to deal with. Some of the
names you heard in the resolution were husband and wife, husband, wife
and a mother in one instance, where they all perished. People were
finding their material things in the woods several counties over, and I
think I read something in the paper recently about things as far away as
Virginia were found that belonged in Bertie County. That was a horrific
day, and something that they will always remember. As a dedication,
there’s going to be a documentary this evening for those of you who
might have an opportunity to listen at 7:30. They’re going to do a
documentary on tornadoes, and they will be highlighting Bertie County. I
say to my fellow constituents from Bertie County and all of the
officials who took the time to come with them, continue to look up and
know our troubles are not over.</p>

ladies and gentleman, i want to thank you first and foremost
representative for putting this on the agenda, for having this. that was
a tough time two years ago, I think we all learned a lot about
ourselves, and 24 deaths is terrible, just can never justify that in
your mind. We had two deaths in lee county, it was a tough time, and I
will tell you, for all that we had a tremendous amount of miracles in
lee county. I know a lot of you saw the lowes building in lee county
that was completely flattened, we had several hundred in the building
and not a single person died, it was a miracle by itself. That afternoon
I was actually at my store with a couple of gentleman, and you see it on
tv a thousand times and you think &quot;oh, what would you do? what
would you do?&quot;, and it never really crosses your mind, I'll tell
you a kind of story, I walked outside that day and we had heard on the
wrl and channel 11 and radio, that potentially we were going to have
tornadoes, so you walk around and you spark about it and you never think
its going to happen to you, cause I'm 43 and I've never seen a tornado
in my life, had no idea what to expect, so I walk outside, in the five
blocks from where I'm standing and I look up and say &quot;well that's a
crazy looking cloud&quot;, and one of the fellows is with me, I look up
and I said &quot;what are those birds flying in front of that cloud
for?&quot;, I had never seen that, well it was houses it was destroyed.
It was terrible, I couldnt believe what I was seeing, now I'll tell you
the miracles, one of the gentleman was with me, we were trying to figure
out what to do, cause I had had no plan, I had never seen anything like
this, so I was trying to figure out where i'm going to go, he gets in
his vehicle and he goes straight to the lowes where the damage is done,
and I had no clue what to do, i'm trying to lock up, trying to figrue
out what im going to do, and he calls me as the tornado, you dont know
which way its going, as close as you are, you have no idea if the
tornado is coming to you or going where, but for some reason he chases
it, he gets there and helps people, what i realized was that tornado
went right by his house, destroyed every house, but his, it was just
amazing at some of the things we saw throughout that period, we had a
lady that was in a bathtub and her home land down, she went over 200
yards, destroyed her whole home and she survived, we had so many
miracles that we saw that day, that it really touches the community, now
for the freshmen here i'll tell you a story from me real quick. I was
only in the general assembly about two or three months when this
happened and I called my seatmate, well it wasnt my seatmate, it was the
gentleman that was in charge to help me which was representative baals.
He says &quot;I'll be there in 20 minutes&quot;, so he came up from up
from moore county and spent the rest of the day with me, and that day
noone had a party affiliation, no one even cared, we didnt care, we was
just trying to help people, just trying to get out. Our neighbors were
working together, our community, as terrible as things were, whole
neighborhoods completely destroyed. We were out helping each other, and
they came together, it was so much love, its different, its changed us
all, it changed me. The way I see things and the what I predicted how to
react to a tornado, its not how you think you react, plus you realize
its going over and people are potentially dying and theres nothing you
can do, it was a terrible day for Lee county, but the other parts I saw,
the baptist men, I'd heard about them, I'd never seen them in action
before in my life. Ladies and Gentleman its a true honor to see the
baptist men. You ever want to make a donation help them, they come to
your community they set uop kitchens, they set up food, they go out,
they don't ask any questions, they say &quot;what can we do?&quot;, I
was truly amazed at the effort they made to come to our community and
make a difference, and it changed my thought process so much, cause i'd
never seen anything like it before, they were getting limbs off of
peoples houses, taking warm food in with no power, no water was going to
be up for at least a week</p>

and they stayed.  The Red Cross came and they helped out.  They set up
camp at one of our local schools, and people were able to come in.  You
know, I called my wife and I said you know hon, we're so lucky.  These
people have lost everything, and are so happy to be here.  You know, we
don't know how lucky we are.  They didn't have a choice.  It was never a
decision.  It came up so quick, and it happened.  But saying that, it
was a lot to learn.  I would also say that the state department of
public safety came in, and they did a tremendous job.  I don't know what
else we could've done.  If you don't know, I chaired a tornado committee
after that to try to figure out how we could do better response.  I
mean, they did a great job.  FEMA came to town.  They set up.  I don't
know that FEMA could have done anything any different than they did.
They were truly responsive to the people in my community, helping every
way they can.  So, in a terrible ordeal that happened two years ago,
with 24 tragic deaths, I'll say I don't know, I'm tremendously,
tremendously sorry about those deaths.  We learned a lot about our
community, and we learned a lot about ourselves.  And what I learned in
?? county was there's a lot of love, and a lot of great neighbors out
there that will do anything to help you, and a lot of great
organizations that will come in and help you at their most weakest
moment.  With that, Mr. Chair, I would recommend the resolution.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At 4:15 PM, April 16, two years ago, I was laying across my bed in my
home, and the wind began to come.  The moment, I said this is more than
a wind, and got up and moved to the hall to bow down and to pray,
because I prayed the tornado hit my home, and my community.  And I feel
so blessed to know that we were not in the shape of the people of ??
county.  We had the Methodist men, we had the Baptist men, I even had
the Carolina hurricanes at my house with chain saws, trying to help take
down the trees and in my community that day, and in the days that
followed.  And I feel so blessed that the damage that was done to me was
a temporary damage, and we were able to rebuild, and I learned a lot
about people and love during these difficult times.  So I want to say to
the people of Bertie county, my heart and prayers go out to you as you
continue to fix the things that need to be fixed that you can fix.  But
it also goes out to you for the many people that you lost.  And I
commend the resolution.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies gentlemen of the house, it's interesting
that I've had this opportunity to stand here and talk to you today about
what can happen in times of crisis, and especially a weather emergency.
Now, when I came out of the marine core, I have the opportunity's go to
work for another taskmaster, HM Mickey Michaux.  And, believe it or not,
one thing that happened while at work was his building was hit by a
tornado.  And we were in the building, working as he would always have
us doing, and heard it coming.  And ladies gentlemen, if you've never
really heard it, if you've never been in one, and I was in one, it
sounds literally like a freight train.  You've heard people say it.  It
really does sound like that.  My office is one of the offices, he was
kind enough to give me one and offices on the outer perimeter of the
building, buildings built much like these, with big glass windows from
top to bottom.  And, as he went around and said, hey everybody get into
the center of the building, where the functional core of the building
is, where the restrooms and the stairwells and so forth.  I reached back
in my office to grab my coat off the door.  When I slammed the door, the
floor to ceiling glass windows were sucked out of my office, along with
what ever case files or whatever else went out.  And we went into the,
actually in the men's restroom, we didn't go into the ladies room , we
went into the men's restroom and stayed there for a while, and then
periodically he or his brother would go and check.  They wouldn't send
the young lawyers out.  He and his brother would go out and check.  I
think it might've been a liability concern on his part.  But they would
go and check.  And our cars were removed from the parking lots.  The
building next door was totally flat.  The roof was taken off the
building where we were, and it was a commercial building local luckily,
or I don't know what would've happened to us.</p>

But as I talk about that personal experience I think the people of
Bertie County and North Carolina also exemplify to use how important the
work is we do here.  I was Chair of the Homeland Security Military and
Veterans Affairs Committee for a session and talked about, and worked
with, and looked at and tried to take the members over to look at
emergency management and what we had to do in those cases. And of course
we always go through the struggle of what do we do to fund emergency
management, and training and resources, when is it important and what
can we do, and I think this is an example to us to how important the
work is we do do as we plan for emergencies and make sure that help is
there.  And so for those folks who survived and those folks that we were
able to provide aide to as they recovered this will remind us how solemn
are responsibility is to prepare for those times of emergency and take
that extra effort and make sure those resources are there.  So, I
commend a resolution to you.  I would state that this particular day,
April 16th, was one of the most tragic weather days in the history of
the United States.  It was the second highest death toll as a result of
people being killed in storms regionally not just in North Carolina but
in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia.  You
may remember having seen the news reports and so we are like so many
other states except we have this opportunity to plan as we go forward
and learn from this. So, I command a resolution to you and I hope it
will be more prepared in the future and we can save North Carolinian's
lives by better planning and budgeting and looking out for our fellow
man because as Representative Stone said &quot;that's truly what it's
about&quot;.  So, I commend the resolution to you.

Welcome. House bill 468 the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]?? The
substitute of house bill 468 the bill for the ?? act to change the
method of election of the mayor and city council members of Highpoint
and to hold the elections on odd number years and by non partisan
primary. An election method is provided by general law. General senator
of North Carolina ?? [SPEAKER CHANGE]Representative Faircloth is
recognized [SPEAKER CHANGES] speak on the bill [SPEAKER CHANGE] you're
recognized to speak on the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you mr speaker.
The city of Highpoint currently has its election for the city council in
the even numbered years. And they are elected by none partisan polarity
election method. There is a story behind why this change is coming
about. And its primarily because about a dozen years or so when the
change was made to the polarity system and made to the even number
years. I was on the council at that time and we were trying to get a
better turn out for our local elections. We were only getting about 11
percent. So we made the decision to change to the polarity and the even
numbered years and we have gotten a better turn out but the results of
the election have been sort of mixed and so recently the council decided
they wanted to go back to the way it use to be. And before I explain
that if I might to mr speaker I'd like send forth an amendment [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You're recognized to send forth an amendment the clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Faircloth move to amend the bill
on page 1 line 21 by deleting the word date and substituting the word

The change asked for in this bill would change the election back to even
numbered years, excuse me, from even numbered years to odd numbered
years, and would change the election from non-partisan plurality method,
back to non-partisan primary and election method, which is the way it
was in the past. If this change takes effect, it would take effect in
the 2017 election. This is subject of course to a referendum which was
recommended to the council by the Guilford delegation, and the
referendum would take place in November 2014 and would have to be
approved by the voters in order for it to take effect. We do have
unanimous support from the city council and mayor, and we have unanimous
support from the Guilford delegation, and I ask that you support the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Representative
Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of

to certainly support their desires as a part of their legislative agenda
to us. So I’m going to support the bill and encourage you to as well.

passed and will be sent to the Senate, and engrossed before being sent
to the Senate. House Bill 591. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 591, a bill to be entitled an act to specify the term of
office for appointed members of the North Carolina longitudinal data
system board and to make state information officer chair of the North
Carolina longitudinal data system board, to specify the times for
meeting of the North Carolina longitudinal data system board, and to
require quarterly reporting of the progress of the North Carolina
longitudinal data system. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell is recognized to explain the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a bill that
relates to a bill with a very similar title that was passed by the
General Assembly last year. It’s here because we’re doing some cleanup
or technical changes, largely. The bill last time provided for the
appointment of members to this longitudinal data studies board. The
speaker appointing members of the House, the president pro tempore was
going to appoint members of the Senate, and the question was raised as
to whether or not there was a constitutional problem with the separation
of powers because this board under the legislation that we adopted last
year, has the authority to make rules. A North Carolina Supreme Court
decision has held that that is an executive branch function, and
therefore legislators could not be involved in the process. So this bill
changes the bill to recognize that House and Senate members will not
serve on the board. In part, it also reacts to that fact by requiring
some additional reporting from the board, both to the Information
Technology Oversight Committee and to the Education Oversight Committee,
and I believe to the General Government Oversight Committee. The idea
being that we want to keep our finger in the pie to the extent of
staying on top of whether this new board is getting various state
agencies to cooperate together in sharing information that we need, in
order to better evaluate the effectiveness of various programs that we
fund. Apart from that, the only other changes I think are that we
decided to go ahead and designate the state’s chief information officer
as the chair of the board. Before, the chair of the board was to be
chosen from the membership and they would elect him, but we decided to
go ahead and designate the state chief information officer for that
role. And it has some additional dates that are added</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'd like to ask the gentleman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Who would you like to ask?  Representative Hager?
Representative Hager, do you yield?  He yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Hager, I'm just curious, does this
less diploma do the grounding, rather than an electrician?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It actually does, there's 3 definitions there, fire
sprinkler, contractor/plumber or HVAC contractor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Another question Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the gentleman yield?  He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  What exactly does it actually do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It allows the plumber that installs the corrugated
stainless steel piping, or the fire sprinkler contractor, or the HVAC
contractor, it allows them to ground the tubing as they would their
normal plumbing offset.  The plumber normal grounds his own plumbing,
this would allow the plumber that installs it, to ground it also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Can you assure us that a hazard is not going to be
created somewhere down the line by those who are not familiar, people
who are not familiar with this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  If you ask me to assure that there wouldn't be an
incident, I don't think anybody can assure you that as they could if an
electrician did it.  But, they're as careful, and have the same bonding
requirements on the ground.  The bonding and plumbing as they do to the
stainless steel tubing.  So it's fairly subjective.

I'd like to thank the people of District 92. I'd really like to thank my
wife. My son had surgery this morning, and because of people like us,
who have spouses in our homes, like my wife, that allows me to do this
job. My son and my wife did a great job. It was probably harder on my
wife than my son this morning, but he's fine. Publicly, I'd like to
thank her for allowing me to do this, while she stays at home and does a
much more difficult job.

Question for Representative Moore.

Does Representative Moore yield for a question? He does.

Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Moore, you made an announcement about election laws
meeting tomorrow. Did you say we were going to make a vote on that
tomorrow?

We will.

Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Where did the understanding come from? A lot of us that the vote would
not be taken until the 24th, which was the following Wednesday. That we
would be just discussing the bill and talking about it. Then, getting it
out on the 24th. That was the understanding quite a few of us had on
that, Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'm not sure of those dates. I know it will come out of elections
tomorrow and then it will go to, I believe the finance committee after
that. It won't come directly to the floor.

may. Just to concur with the speaker staff, the 24th is more looking at
a vote on the floor on the voter ID bill. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I
would move that the house adjourn, subject to the re referral of bills
and resolutions. I do so in honor and memory of the victims of the
terrorist attack in Boston, to reconvene tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 p.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

the house adjourn, subject to re-referral of bills and resolutions to
