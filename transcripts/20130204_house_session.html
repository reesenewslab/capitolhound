The House will come to order, members will take their seats, visitors

Members and visitors will please silence all cellular phones. The prayer
today will be offered by Eagle Scout and Representative Bert Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We join in prayer. Our Father and our God, we gather again in this house
of the people, as those that have been entrusted with great
responsibility. We ask that you would grant us much godly wisdom. That
we would govern rightly in your sight, according to your word. And we
know from your word that you are able to do exceedingly, abundantly
above all that we ask or think. Father we pray that your spirit will be
the guiding influence that will govern the tone and the actions of this
general assembly. Likewise, we pray for our governor, and all the
Executive Branch of our government, and also we pray for our Supreme
Court, and all the Judicial Branch. We remember those that came before
us. We honor the good, and we repent of the evil. We ask your
forgiveness, and we pray that you will look upon our state with favor.
We would echo the words that begin our state constitution. As we humble
ourselves and honor you, almighty God, the sovereign ruler of nations.
Thankful to you for the existence of our liberties, and dependent upon
you for the continuance of those liberties. We acknowledge that our
rights do not come from governments of men or of laws, but that our
rights come from you, almighty God. Father, this evening, we celebrate
the one-hundred-three-year history of the Boy Scouts of America. We
celebrate the timeless godly values that are expressed in the twelve
points of the Scout Law that we will discuss. We pray that you will help
us, as servant leaders, to demonstrate these in our own lives. The scout
promise begins: On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God. May
that promise be our prayer as well. With the knowledge that other will
offer their prayers as they choose, I offer my prayer in the name of
your son, the lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen. Thank you Representative Jones. At this time members and visitors
in the gallery will please remain standing for the presentation of the

[AUDIO BREAKS]  House Resolution honoring the Boy Scouts of America the
House resolves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Clerk will read the resolution in its entirety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas experiencing a kind gesture from an unknown boy scout during a
trip to England, Chicago publisher William D. Boyce decided to establish
a scouting organization in the United States.  Whereas the [AUDIO
BREAKS] Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February the 8th in
1910 in Washington, D.C. and whereas the Boy Scouts of America was
established to provide an educational program for boys and young adults
to build character, to train in the responsibilities of participating
citizenship, and to develop personal fitness, and whereas by 1912 boy
scouts were enrolled in every state in the nation, and whereas Congress
granted the Boy Scouts of America a federal charter on June 15th, 1916,
and whereas since its founding the Boy Scouts of America has provided
more than 110 million youths with the support, friendship, and mentoring
necessary to live a happy and fulfilling life, and whereas currently
almost 120,000 North Carolinians participate in the scouting program,
and whereas local boy scout youths encourage each boy scout to perform
community service each year, and whereas in 2012, scouts in North
Carolina performed more than 500,000 hours of community service
representing millions of dollars in time, talent, and materials to
improve the state's parks, schools, retirement centers, and other public
areas, and whereas Wayne Brock, an eagle scout from Deep Run, North
Carolina has recently been selected as a chief scout executive of the
Boy Scouts of America, now therefore be it resolved by the House of
Representatives:  Section One, the House of Representatives honors the
memory of William D. Boyce for his role in founding the Boy Scouts of
America and expresses its appreciation to the members of the Boy Scouts
of America for their commitment to improving the lives of the citizens
of this state.  Section Two, the principal Clerk shall transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to the National Council of Boy Scouts
of America.  Section Three, this resolution is effective upon adoption.

Representative Jones is recognized to explain the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr.Speaker.  Ladies and Gentlemen, the House it is an honor
and privilege for me to stand here this evening and just speak a good
word on behalf of the Boys  Scouts of America and what it means to me
I'm.  First of all I would just like to ask my    Eagle Scout
Colleagues, the Speaker now stand earlier as   anacor ?? but the
representatives Bill, Dollar, Ford, Ouiler, Mophin, Steve Ross, Soker,
Wadue and Wales would you stand.  I would also like to  recognize there
is that are known to be parents and even the grant parent   enable to
scale representative Sueson Fisher, representative Ruth Samuelson and
representatives Mophin and  Wales are the parents of Eagle Scouts as
well as being an Eagle Scout and representative either as even the
parent and grand parent of Eagle Scouts. I would just like to
acknowledge my colleagues and thank you for being part of Scouting and
you may be seated.  Especially I wanted to introduce  the parents,   I
think anybody  who has ever been involved in such an endeavor would say
that it would have been very very difficult to do without the support of
our parents.  People get involved with Scouting, I know many reasons.
   There are many things that boys are taught through the scouting, you
learn a lot about the outdoors, you learn about the tying knots. They
learn about the citizenship, they are the mere badges that have to do
with the citizenship, in the community and in the nation and in the
World and  so many things you can learn about   very first day, many
practical things.  Learn CPR  for the first time as, as a Boys Scout.
Representative Corney I know you can particularly appreciate that.  The
Scouting has been  wonderful endeavor and I just wanna say for all the
things that you have learned in Scouts, the most important, the most
important   are those timeless values that are taught to boys and they
are embodied largely in the 12 points of the  Scout Law. I would just
like to remind you what they are.  Scout is  trustworthy, loyal,
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave,
clean and reverent.  I saw some of my colleagues say those along with
me.   Scout are taught to be prepared to do a good turn daily. That's
the scout motto in the  scout slogan.  Scouts are taught to be
physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight. Teaching boys
these qualities, I would submit to you, you have to build men, men that
would be better husbands, better fathers,  better soldiers,  better
citizens, better people.   So I would submit to you that we have all
benefited from those values that have been taught  to you countless
thousands of boys in this State over the last 103 years.  With that in
mind Mr. Speaker, I commend the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate, hearing none, the question for the
house is the adoption  of house resolution 52.  All in favour will vote
AYE,all who opposed will vote NO.  The clerk will open the vote.
Clerk will lock the machine and    record the vote. 116 having voted in
the affirmative    and zero in the negative.  The resolution is adopted
and ordered permit.   Wue?? will recognize our justice Nuvie's time
would like to recognize a few folks in the gallery.  We have with us
Secretary, Bill Dotrich who is an Eagle Scout and a recipient of the CU
Silver Wever, presently serves on regional  Board of the Boys Scouts of
America.  Thank you for being with us today, Mr. Secretary.</p>

<p id="020:00">
[APPLAUSE] At this time we welcome Justice Nouvie to the well of the
house for the report to the state on behalf of the Boy Scouts of
America.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, from the mountains to the
city, Boy Scouting in North Carolina is flourishing. Almost a hundred
and twenty thousand North Carolinians are involved in the eleven
councils of our state. Equipping young men and women to do their duty to
God and country. These 87,000 scouts and 33,000 young adult volunteers
provide more than one half million hours of community service each year
benefiting the people of our state. On your desk you will find a copy of
scouting’s 2013 report to the state and we commend it to you for your
consideration. Scouting develops leadership and character, which is
illustrated by the leaders of our state who as youth attained the rank
of Eagle Scout. For example, as you’ve heard 10 members of this chamber
as well as 5 Senators are Eagle Scouts. Likewise Secretary of
Administration Bill Daltridge was an Eagle Scout. As well as the new
National Chief Scout Executive Wayne Brock, who is from Deepron in
Lenore County. While the traditional scouting programs flourish, so do
the innovative ones. One such program is the Rocky Mount Police
Department Explorer Post 774. Will the explorers and adult leaders of
post 774 please stand? They’re here. Since 1977 this post has nurtured
and guided socially disadvantaged young men and women in the community,
introducing them to possible careers in law enforcement. The program has
produced several law enforcement leaders, including U.S. Marshall Scott
Parker and Captain Martin McCoy of the Rocky Mount Police Department.
Both of these men credit the Explorer Post for their direction and their
successful careers. Thank you, Post 774. You may be seated. Another
[APPLAUSE]
Another unique program is High Point Troop and Venture Crew 7 which was
developed to help Hispanic young people be comfortable with their own
heritage and American Scouting ideals. Will the members and leaders of
Troop and Venture Crew 7 please stand? Over on this side.
[APPLAUSE]
This 100% Latino troop and crew have over 30 young men and women
learning skills which enable them to help their community. The scouts
serve their community by volunteering as translators during times of
emergencies. Collecting funds and goods for disaster relief and
identifying and meeting other community needs. These scouts discovering
the joy of serving others. Thank you Troop and Crew 7 for being with us.
You may be seated. Now some of you may be thinking that scouting can’t
be all that challenging. After all, you’ve seen which of your colleagues
are eagles. But, if you think that you ought to watch the new reality tv
show debuting on the National Geographic Channel on March the 4th, Are
you Tougher than a Boy Scout? As part of a nationwide talent hunt, 11
scouts were selected, but only 1 was chosen from Southeastern United
States. And that scout is with us tonight. Will Big South Flemming. Will
would you please stand to be recognized?
[APPLAUSE]
Will is a third generation Eagle Scout from here in Raleigh. A senior at
Braughton High School who serves his local boy scout 388 as an assistant
scoutmaster. An avid skeet shooter, Will is a member of the National
Skeet Shooting Association. He’s currently ranked as an A+ class
shooter. Shooting all four shotgun gauges with an overall average of
96%. He hopes to qualify for team U.S.A. at the summer Olympics. Good
luck, Will, we’ll all be pulling for ya. Since 1910 the Boy Scouts of
America have helped develop exemplary character in the young people of
our land. The 12 points of the Scout Law as recited by Representative
Jones are as important to civil society today as they were 103 years
ago. Likewise the Scout Oath’s emphasis on emphasizes the value of
integrity. On my honor I’ll do my best.</p>

source of our liberties. It begins, we the people of the state of North
Carolina grateful to almighty God, the sovereign ruler of nations, for
the preservation of the American union and the existence of our civil

[SPEAKER] Committee Substitute for House Bill 4, a bill to be titled an
act to address the unemployment insurance debt and to focus North
Carolina’s Unemployment Insurance Program on Putting Claimants Back to
Work.  The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. Many
of you were in the Finance Committee Meeting last Thursday and heard a
lot of the parts of this Bill, and we’re going to go over it again
tonight.
This is an offer, an option to the turning, it’s an alternative by
addressing number one, the issue. And the issue is, and I had to change
these numbers this morning. We currently owe $2.5 billion to the Federal
Government. And this is a debt of all the employers across the State of
North Carolina.
So what’s the consequence with this debt? It puts North Carolina at a
sheer disadvantage with respect to trying to recruit jobs and bring in
new industries to North Carolina. The day that a new company opens their
doors for business in this state, they automatically become a debtor.
They have to repay part of this debt to the Federal Government.
And as I said, this proposal offers an alternative to the current
repayment plan which has a final payment date of 2019. And in each year
the Federal tax will increase on each employer for each employee that
they have on their payroll. And that’s the Federal Government’s
repayment plan. We didn't select it. It was automatically given to us,
the repayment plan of this debt.
If you pass this bill tonight, and the Senate does likewise, and the
Governor signs this bill, we can have this debt repaid by the last
quarter of 2015, possibly 2016. And we will have a billion dollars in
our soda ??  fund which makes our plan solvent. We don’t have to do
anything. We can continue on the same course that we've been on for many
years. But we are not doing justice to the employers of the State of
North Carolina. This is not a state debt. This does not have anything to
do with the general fund but we have the authority to change our state
plan, and that’s what we’re trying to do now to become solvent in a
shorter period of time.
Tonight, I’m sure that we’re going to hear some accusations regarding
who’s at fault. Well, I can assure you there’s enough fault and blame to
go all the way across the town of Raleigh but that we’re not going to
gain anything by doing that, pointing fingers and proving that in 1994
certain things happened, in 1996. You can go all the way back and the
facts are there. And the facts that you are going to hear, they’re the
truth. I’m not going to argue that, that they’re not. All of the
accusations in that part are the truth.
I’m also sure that you’re going to hear a lot of accusations about how
this bill was crafted, that it was done behind closed door, there was
sunlight on this bill, that the information was not made public, that no
one knew what the outcome of this bill was going to be. But will tell
you factually that that is untruth.</p>

they did business the way they will do business after July 1 of 2013 I'm
proud to say that we have the new director of the division of employment
security on the floor tonight and that gentleman David Clag is totally
committed to implementing this bill and doing the right thing the thing
that we have looked at we all knew we had a problem and [??] excuse from
this statement but it also has to have us know that we had a problem but
we failed to address that problem because it was too difficult one of
the charges to the division of unemployment will be we want to put
people back to work opposed to becoming dependent on a weekly cheque and
that cheque was never meant to be a long time solution it's certainly
not a living wage and back in 19 and 35 when this program was created
the definition was short term bridge to re-employment slowly it is
becoming something different that's why we have to address this
situation there's also another part in the bill that focuses on
fraudulent abuse and the ability to collect those improper fraudulent
payments that are out there in the state of North Carolina while were
working on this bill we found that a 131 people incarcerated over at
central prison were using the public phone calling the division of
unemployment and that was their check in so they were able to draw
unemployment benefits when they checked in they were reporting that they
were able and available for work when we now have the provisions in
place that we can reclaim those dollars the way we fix that little
problem was we just blocked the number for the division of unemployment
from over at the prison they can't call that number anymore another
chief component is the division of workforce solutions and that's under
the directions of the department of commerce gentleman by the name of
Roger Shackle Ford I believe his assistant secretary over there and they
will be implementing all of the necessary parts of this bill one piece
that I will bring to your attention there will be a face to face
interview with all new claimants the purpose of that is to assist their
skills to determine if they need re-training or training but to match
these new claimants with jobs that are available in the state of North
Carolina and folks we wanna help these people find a job when I was at
home this weekend talked to a lot of folks and most of the people who're
currently on the unemployment they want a job they want to go back to
work and this is our objective to help them find that job I won't tell
you this bill is not perfect times change people change circumstances
change but I'd like to draw your attention if you have a copy of the
bill in front of you section 10 to be established a joint legislative
[??] committee and I'm gonna promise you that's gonna be a working.

Committee. I believe there's going to be four members appointed by our
speaker to serve on this committee, and there will be four members form
the senate appointed by the president pro [??]. And as things change in
the future, we will be able to sit there and address these changes with
the department. It's gonna be a partnership that we work together. I'm
gonna give you the short summary of the bill. The bill is lengthy but it
was even longer in days gone by, and we didn't take anything out, the
only thing that we did was just combine some of the language to make it
easier to read.
There's something called the employment security reserve fund and that
is money that is collected from a surtax, a surtax that all of your
employers pay. I want you to think about three silos. You have the [??]
tax paid by the employers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard if the lady will yield without
objection the chair will suspend the 15 minutes time limit so that the
member can continue the explanation. Is there objection? continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. There's the three silos and all of the
taxes are paid by the employer, there's no contribution by the employee.
So this employment security reserve fund we have now - we will restrict
the uses of this fund and cap the fund at $50 million dollars or the
amount of the interest payment from the previous year. And any excess of
this surtax will be swept to the federal government to apply toward our
debt.
There's a worker training trust fund and training employment account and
we found several different accounts at the division, and we're going to
eliminate these accounts because worker training is paid through a whole
different source of funding from the federal government. And we're gonna
take all of these dollars and transfer any balances in these accounts to
our UI fund. There's the special security employment administration
fund, and we found there was about 16 million dollars just laying in
that fund. We're going to take ten million dollars and have that swept
towards our debt, holding six million just in case there's an emergency
for some unknown reason.
The financing change, the SUTA changes, remember that's one of the three
silos, SUTA, the state unemployment tax assessment. We're gonna increase
the minimum and the maximum contribution by .06 and we're also moving to
a formula as opposed to a very complicated tax table. This is a tax
increase that the employers of the state of North Carolina have asked
and agreed to have imposed on themselves.
Another one of those three silos is the 20% surtax, it's been on there
for many many years, but we're putting a trigger on that surtax and if
the UI fund equals or exceeds one billion dollars than that surtax,
again being paid by your employers, will trigger off putting more money
back in the general fund of the employer with the hope that he or she
will create those new jobs. However, if the fund drops below that
billion dollars it automatically triggers back on. There's three
subgroups. That's the Indian Nation, the tribe, we only have one, that's

[Speaker changes.]...Cherokee tribe.  All government entities and all
non-profits. They do business in a different way because they have a
special, federal cut-out provision that allows them to do that.
Currently, today, we, the State of North Carolina, each of your cities
and your counties, unfortunately have the prerogative to have their
benefits paid out the day that they are supposed to be paid out but they
do not reimburse the fund for some...in some cases, twenty-two months
later. So you can see that that's a drain on our account. When this bill
passes, the State of North Carolina (That's why you see a little fiscal
note?? with this bill.) The State of North Carolina and each city and
each county will post one percent of their taxable wages in an account
and that account will be used as a &quot;draw account&quot; and my
friend, Representative Starnes used the analogy that this was currently
... they were usin' a credit card. Now they will be using a debit card
because they will have the money in the account.  That account will
be...well, we'll true up that account once a year and everybody is
playing at the table. When I talked about that this was a carefully, and
sometimes painfully crafted bill.  When those people came to the table,
they were not thrilled, they weren't happy but they too
understand...this is their tax base...in every city, every county...and
they needed to be at the table to be able to pay their fair share in a
timely manner.  Now the benefit changes. There's not a lot of
conversation about the benefit changes, about ????? the State of North
Carolina will be looked at twice a year to make any adjustments.  If we
could ever get to 5.5% of unemployment, we don't need but just a few
weeks to put people back into jobs. Another change is the calculation of
the weekly benefit and that will be based on the average of the last two
quarters, opposed to the high quarters. Talking about some of those
changes, that change was made in 1994. The maximum weekly benefit,
that's what all of your emails have been flying about...to max that out
at $350. Many folks have asked, well, where did that number come from?
It's pretty simple, if you look at the chart and add up all of the other
states, divide by the like number, you're gonna come up with $350. I am
not proud when I look at the chart to see that North Carolina is outside
of the bell curve.  We are the highest benefit...weekly benefit state in
the south...sixteen southern states. That's not anything necessarily to
be proud of.  We want to be equal to but we don't need to be above.
There's a waiting week requirement. We require a waiting week for all
new claims and removing the waivers with regard to the waiting week. We
have repealed the extended base period, the extended benefit trigger, we
retained the two optional triggers but only when the benefits are paid
100% by the federal government.  There's something that's called...and
I'm almost done, ya'll!</p>

<p id="055:00">
[Speaker changes.] There's something that is called attached claims.
Unfortunately, the business community in the state of North Carolina has
used attached claims as part of their business model. If their chief,
cook and bottle washer is currently employed at this restaurant...let's
use the restaurant...and business gets a little slow and they don't need
him to work every week, the employer simply files an attached claim for
this employee and that means that that employee is still somewhat
attached to that business. He, the employee, does not hafta look for
work, does not hafta go to the employment security office, does not
hafta be reassessed for training or re-training. We have eliminated for
all practical purposes the provision of attached claim. Was your
business community excited about that? No, but it was the right thing to
do because better than half of the debt that we owe the federal
government directly came from attached claims. We do provide a provision
if that employer has a credit balance in his account, then he can do it
one time per employee up to a six weeks' timeframe. There will be no
further extensions where we've had attached claims ???????? for
sometimes three to four months. The disqualification is based on each
application for the benefits. We have removed substantial fault and most
of the &quot;good cause provisions&quot;. We retained good cause for
domestic violence and also spousal relocation due to a military
assignment.  We did eliminate most of the other &quot;good cause
provisions&quot;. We have provided a clear definition for suitable work.
It is defined as suitable work as &quot;any work after ten weeks with UI
benefits&quot;.  Ladies and gentlemen, that is the brief explanation
and, Mister Speaker, at this time, I'd like to make a motion.
[Speaker changes.] The lady is recognized for a motion.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, I move that we give House Bill 4 a
favorable and I stand to answer any questions, not trying to cut off the
debate and, secondly, Mister Speaker, I'd like to ask that staff be
permitted on the floor.
[Speaker changes.] The staff are permitted on the floor and available to
any member as needed. Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the bill and then to offer an amendment.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.  Members of the House,
this is a very unbalanced bill. The people who are not included in the
discussion of this bill are the unemployed. The unemployed people of
this state had no advocates at the table as this bill was crafted.
Representative Howard has presented the bill as she has talked about
this group and that group and the other group but she has not talked
about the groups not represented and that means the unemployed people of
this state. What that has meant is that when she says very eloquently,
and I appreciated very much her presentation...when she says we're all
at fault or everyone's at fault, please remember the unemployed are not
at fault. The unemployed had nothing to do with the decision of the
General Assembly six times, sometimes with a Republican Speaker,
sometimes with a Democratic Speaker...through the 1990's to lower the
unemployment tax so that employers paid less into the unemployment
insurance fund. Workers had nothing to do with that yet workers are ....</p>

<p id="060:00">
A major hit in this bill. How major? The staff did a calculation. The
staff did a calculation of the impact between July one 2013, when this
bill takes affect, and December thirty-one 2017. So, basically, we're
talking about four and a half years. In that four and a half year
period, the increase in the state unemployment tax to employers, the
increase is twenty-four million dollars total, between 2013 and 2013.
Cumulative, twenty-four million dollars. Try to guess how much is being
given up during that same period by the unemployed of this state. The
answer is, according to our fiscal staff, two point seven billion
dollars in lost benefits. That is to say, in this bill, the ratio of
taxes imposed upon business, state unemployment taxes, is twenty-four.
The hit on workers  and other unemployed is two point seven billion.
That is a one to one hundred ratio. To me that is simply indefensible
and could only happen because there were no advocates for the
unemployed. Let me say, well, why would that have really been necessary,
certainly the bill could be developed. Friends, in 2011 we had workers
compensation reform, as it was called. Advocates for workers were at the
table. We had medical malpractice reform, attorneys for those who filed
claims were at the table. So, this bill is unusual and extraordinary in
leaving the unemployed away from the debate and if you've gotten emails
the way I have over the weekend, you'll have very clear emails from
unemployed saying nobody talked to me about what it'd mean to my family
in terms of loss of the ability to pay health insurance. In some cases,
couple letters I've seen, the ability to pay my mortgage, so there will
be a foreclosure on my house. And a very telling point from several of
the letters which I received, was this; you're cutting my unemployment
benefits which means I will be going to the department of social
services, I will be going to the department of health, I will be going
to the emergency room of the local hospital. In other words, you're just
shifting costs here. You're hurting me. You're hurting me financially
and you're forcing me to go to ask for government assistance, which I'd
rather not have, but you're forcing me to do that. In other words, I can
not live on the limited amount of the unemployment that, benefits that
you're imposing in this bill. I'm sure of it because I'm barely getting
by on what I'm being payed right in my benefits and I know I can't do it
on the reductions that we have. Now, why in addition to that, basically
one to one hundred ratio, which to me is enough reason why we ought to
vote down this bill and star over with a more balance package. It's also
important to know that North Carolina is not so out of whack with other
southern states. For example, according to staff report, first of all
North Carolina is at the national average. The national average for
unemployment, average weekly benefit is two hundred and ninety-seven
dollars. North Carolina's is two hundred and ninety-one. And as to there
being no other state in the southeast that is close to North Carolina,
well North Carolina pays two ninety-one average, Virginia pays two
eighty-eight. There's no difference there. So, Virginia, we're not out
of whack with Virginia. We will be a whole lot lower than Virginia with
this bill, which will hurt the unemployed of this state. But it's just
important not to exaggerate the problem and i think it's also clear when
you look at the title bill. That the title of the bill is actually
incomplete, is understated. Because what needs to be stated in the title
of the bill, you have it on the screen or you have a hard copy. It says
a bill entitled enact to address the unemployment insurance debt North
Carolina, etcetera. But, it should say; and to address cuts in the
benefits of the unemployed. That's really what's in this bill to such a
major extent. The last point I would make before offering my amendment,
members, is this; the payments being made by employers, both the state
taxes and taxes that are being paid to the federal uninsurance,
unemployment fund are temporary. When the debt is paid off, as
Representative Howard has said, when the debt is paid off...</p>

that extra tax is going away. It's a temporary increase in people's, in
employer's taxes. But the benefit cuts are permanent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is so unfair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will yield.
Rep. Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Rep. Luebke a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Luebke, in the bill, and I have read this several times, this
information, the increases in the sorta tax that are being put in this
bill against all employers, sir, do you understand that that is not
temporary, that that is a permanent taxation on all of the employers and
it would take the will of this chamber and the Senate chamber to remove
or reduce those taxes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Howard, what I'm referring to is the additional taxes. Of course,
?? is in our statutes. But the additional taxes we're talking about, the
additional hit on employers under ??, the state tax, is just 24 million
over this entire period.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, Mr. Luebke, with all due respect, do you understand that the tax
increase for ?? tax in this bill is permanent. It does not go away once
the debt is paid. I just want to be sure that you heard that clearly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I do understand that piece, but the piece I'm referring to is the
amount of payments that people are making to the federal fund. And those
will go away, indeed that's the whole purpose of running the bill as you
have. Is for that to be a temporary event that happens more quickly than
would otherwise be the case. Those will be going off, they are
temporary. But the cuts to the employees, to the unemployed are not
temporary. Thank you Rep. Howard.
Mr. Speaker, with that I'd like to move adoption of my amendment-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has been recognized for comments, the gentleman will be
recognized to send forth his amendment in turn. The gentleman also has
time left if you'd like to continue your debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, I know we'd all like to eat dinner tonight, so I'm finished. But
are you saying Mr. Speaker, that you'll recognize me in a few minutes
from now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the clerk is in possession of 6
amendments, all amendments will be heard. We have conferred with the
minority caucus, and I think that there is some agreement to try and
limit the discussion on the amendments. The chair has every intention of
allowing anyone who wishes to speak on the bill to speak, and we will be
here as long as we need to to extend you that courtesy.
Rep. Tine is recognized to send forth an amendment, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Tine moves to amend the bill on page 8, line 51, to page 9, line 2,
by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I understood that amendments were being taken later, but
you would not recognize me for my amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recognized in turn, the chair recognized you for
comments, the chair now recognizes Rep. Tine to speak to his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
To start I would like to thank Chairman Howard again, and the revenue
oversight committee for their work on this extremely important issue. It
is very important that we get this debt paid as quickly as possible so
if we should have another setback inside of the state we're more
fiscally sound and prepared for that event. Therefore my amendment does
not adjust the timeline in any way, and still creates a payback by 2015.
What my amendment does is change the max payment from $350 to $425, that
would be offset by an increase in the ?? by 15/100ths of a percentage
point. This would create some additional pain from employers and future
unemployed. The result of this amendment would increase the benefits by
$120 million and cost about $37 per employee, or on a million dollar
payroll would cost about $1800 per year.

responsibility on this unemployment insurance. The only thing that I
will say to you is that I come through a rural county, and I am sure I
am looking out here at a lot of other folks who come from rural
counties, and the county I come from does not have the availability of
jobs. I thought, when I was campaigning, one thing I heard most on the
campaign trail the most was, we need to go to Raleigh and compromise –
not on your principals but on those things that are going to affect NC,
especially those constituents you represent. I thought that, that was
what this bill did. It laid out a very good compromise that was fiscally
responsible and did not over burden the employers. Therefore, I urge the
members of this body to pass this amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I too, want to express my gratitude to the
member offering the amendment, for his courtesy and openness in bringing
this amendment to us.  But with that said, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to
have to ask that we vote against this amendment.  The new rate in the
bill is at .06, and that represents an impact of $12.54 per employee.
And if you only have one or two, ten, maybe 100.  That's not serious
money.  But when you have thousands of employees, every dollar certainly
counts, and I'm not saying that every dollar doesn't count for
everybody, but what this amendment will do is take the .06 rate and
increase it by an additional 1.5 for a  total rate of .21.  And this
would have an impact per employee, the total impact would be $52.67.
That's the $15.05, plus the amendment which creates additional cost of
37.62, for total of $52.67.  Has a pseudo tax.  Let me remind you, that
these employers are already paying additional ??  tax.  That's imposed
by the Federal government.  I would ask you to vote no on the amendment,
and let's do what this bill is designed to do.  To leave those dollars,
as many dollars as we can with the employers, and let them create new
jobs, and have work opportunities.  That's what this is designed to do.
I remind you again, the definition of the program when it was instituted
in 1935.  Short term bridge to reemployment.  Nobody can live on the
amounts is what I keep hearing.  Then I want to ask you, what's the
difference in the price of a loaf of bread in the state of South
Carolina than what it is in the state of North Carolina?  All this
running states have capped their maximum benefit much less than ours.
The average benefits remain the same.  And folks making in the, up to 40
thosand some dollars will see absolutely no change in what they're
drawing.  So let's give this bill an opportunity.  I ask you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.

I'm kind of caught between a couple of things. I

Does the gentleman wish to be recognized for a purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not at this time.

Further discussion, further debate?  If not, the question before the
house is the passage of the amendment offered by representative Tine to
house bill for the House Committee substitute.  All those in favor, vote
aye.  All opposed, vote no.  The clerk will open the vote.  All members
wishing to vote, please record now.</p>

The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 41 having voted in the
affirmative and 74 in the negative, the amendment fails. Representative
Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke moves to amend the bill on page
8, line 51, through page 9, line 2, by re-writing those lines to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, Members. Let me say, first of
all, that this amendment does not challenge the premise of the bill,
that there will be a pay-off in 2015, of the debt. It accepts that there
will be the speeded-up payments. The payment schedule that is advocated
by the bill sponsor, and I accept that at this point for purposes of
this amendment. What I am referencing in the amendment is the fact that
North Carolina has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country
right now. We heard that multiple times, multiple times from a Governor,
and a candidate, who now has told us that he is going to sign this bill.
But during the campaign we heard again and again how North Carolina has
9% unemployment, about the worst in the country. Well, now we have a
situation where we are cutting off benefits to the unemployed at the
very time that we acknowledge that we have a huge unemployment rate. And
particularly in those areas of the west, far west, and east of I-95,
there is terrible unemployment. Many of you know, republicans and
democrats alike, that you have counties in which your unemployment rate
is 15%. That means there are not many jobs out there, and the idea that
somehow we are pampering the unemployed, one of the premises of the
bill, is just wrong. And so, what my amendment does, is two things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will yield, Representative Blust, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the gentleman will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll yield when I'm finished explaining this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields at the end of his debate. The
gentleman may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I didn't want to lose the point here that
we, first of all have terrible unemployment above 15% in many of our
counties. And I want to stress, too, that one of the underlying impacts
of this bill, so far unstated really by anyone, is that, just as
Representative Ross has referenced the fact that people in their 50's
and 60's have a harder time getting jobs, we need to speak the truth on
this floor. Our African American citizens have a harder time finding
jobs, being employed, being re-employed, than do white citizens. So the
fact of the matter is that this bill does have an impact
disproportionately on the African American citizens of our state. We
need to recognize that. Now what my amendment does is this. Very simple.
It says that, given that we have so many long-term unemployed in the
state, shifting the maximum number of weeks back to 20 weeks is just
wrong. 45 of the 50 states have 26 weeks or 25 weeks. That's what we
have under current law. My amendment would bring us back to the current
law. It would say that you could have up to 26 weeks. Does it mean
everybody takes 26 weeks? No. It means those that are having a hard time
getting a job, they can have up to 26 like we used to. This bill says
the maximum they can ever have is 20 weeks. That puts us in a situation
where we are less friendly, less understanding of the needs of long-term
unemployed than Mississippi and Alabama, which, continue to recognize 26
weeks. What I would like to do is bring us back to 26 weeks and note
that to help the long-term unemployed with this amendment, it is a tiny,
tiny cost in terms of the increase in the insurance. The insurance goes
from a 2.9% rate to 3.15%. Truly that is tiny in exchange for bringing
more balance to the bill. If you vote against this amendment, you really
are saying you don't want balance. Because I've identified a place where
the long-term unemployed could really benefit from those extra 6 weeks.
And I've also asked staff to find that place in terms of the cost of the
bill...</p>

[Speaker Changes] Cost of employers, its a tiny amount. So members I
would ask you in the name of fairness, many long term unemployed, that
we amend the bill to go back to the 26 weeks that we have had for
decades in our state law. Speaker, I urge the adaption of the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Blust. Representative Luebke indicated
that he’d be willing to yield to a question.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentlemen wish to pose it at this time?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker, that’d be fine.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Leutke, you said that someone has said
that we’re pampering the unemployed, and I’ve been here the whole
debate. I’ve not heard anyone say that. Who has said that we’re
pampering the unemployed through this bill?
[Speaker Changes] Well first, Representative Blust, you and I are both
in the finance committee and several members said that. They said that
if only the unemployment benefits were available shorter workers would
find jobs faster. Implying that workers are slack and don’t really want
to work. So that was said here. And secondly in the bill’s explanation,
there were references to the fact that we really were two generous to
our people in North Carolina. Why, for example, as it was just said a
few moments ago, should workers in North Carolina receive more
unemployment benefits than those in South Carolina, when the difference
in the cost of a loaf of bread isn’t all that great. My answer to that
would be because we want to be more humane and more caring to our
workers and recognized their situation and how needy they are. But the
fact is, Representative Blesky, it was referenced both in committee and
on the floor.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] During the offering of the amendment, I tried to
quickly get some numbers. This amendment is more costly than the
previous amendment. That would take the psuedo tax and the surcharge to
$77.75. Again, I’m just gonna ask, lets give this bill a chance to run
and go into place. It has been carefully crafted. Again, I’m going to
ask you to vote no on this amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
Representative McMannis, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] I would like to agree with the amendment because of
the people in my district that I’m going to share a personal, but
someone that was with my campaign whose husband worked as a manager with
Townsend who lost his job, had a good job and a good salary, and she
said its not killing us because our house was already paid off, our cars
are older, they’re paid off. But where we had to upgrade our chicken
houses, we’ve got all these loans and they’re killing us. Then she lost
her job. Now fortunately, they both have found work now. She actually
did not go on unemployment, but he was on unemployment for that full
amount of time. He is 59 years old. Think about this, because a lot of
us are somewhere in that age range, he had a good salary and they had
debts that they had to meet. And he lost his salary and he couldn’t find
a job, and its very hard at that age to find work. To find work that
even, any kind of work. He ended up, what he did find, he’s making a lot
less money and he is traveling a lot, but he was thrilled to find it.
And yes, during the finance committee, there were implication that
people chose not to get a job because it was easier to have the
unemployment money. He was so embarrassed and humiliated about not
having a job, he quit going to anything. He quit going to church, he
quit going to functions. It is not easy to sit back and draw
unemployment, just so you can pay your bills when you are trying your
best to get a job and you just can’t find one. I don’t think 26 weeks is
an unreasonable amount. And I think it puts us in the range of 43 other
states. I think thats only fair. And I would like to commend this
amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion, further debate?</p>

sent forth by representative Luebke for the house committee substitute
for house bill 4. All that's in favor vote aye. All oppose vote no. The

commend the bill on page 8 line 52 through page 9 line 2. Rewriting
those lines to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Speaker. My
amendment is sent forth in the spirit of the 16th president of the
united states. One Abraham Licoln. Who defined a conservatism. What is
conservatism. Is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new
and untried? If in deed, Lincolns definition makes sense. Then my
amendment is definitely in his spirit. Because what it does is permit us
to maintain the maximum benefit of $535, as we have in the existing law.
It permits us to maintain the formula that are just that benefit
annually. Based upon the reality of what is going on in our labor
market. And it also in lines 1 through 8, offsets the cost. So that
everything else that has been discussed, in terms of accelerating the
payback does in deed take place and the maximum benefit is kept. In this
debate we have had a reference, I've heard references for instance, of
what goes on in other states. I submit to you ladies and gentlemen that
we live in the great state of North Carolina. Not in the sovereign state
of South Carolina. Not up in the mountains of Tennessee or in the tide
waters of Virginia. What we should be concerned with, is what is just,
what is equitable, to the citizens of north Carolina. The existing law,
only generates a maximum benefit that is 66 and 2/3rds of what the
average wage is. 66 and 2 thirds. The proposal before us un-amended
would reduce that benefit to around 44% of the average wage in north
Carolina. If indeed the existing amount is deemed by many to be
inadequate, as we have heard in this debate. A dial back to 40 something
percent is less than inadequate. I don't know about most of you, but my
email account has been blowing up with communications from rank and foul
citizens. And those citizens have said over and over and over again that
each floor as presented is and i am quoting, a really bad idea. Over and
over and over again.</p>

do, and what it does is it helps those employees who have taken fewer
hours or maybe taken a little bit of a pay cut to keep their job, and
make sure that they don’t get penalized by having their unemployment be
maybe 100 dollars less simply because of what might have happened in the
last two quarters with their employer. People talked about the chief
cook and bottle washer getting cut back on hours but then the employer
having to let them go. This would protect that chief cook and bottle
washer up to 350 dollars, to make sure that he doesn’t maybe get 100
dollars. Maybe he could get 200 dollars a week while he’s looking for
work. Again, the cap would be 350. This is what the vast majority of
states do. This is what our law was back in 1993, and so I commend the
amendment to you. I think it’s the very least that we can do for people
that are out of work through no fault of their own. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment
we had in Finance last Thursday, and again, I’m going to ask you to vote
no on this amendment. It seems that it isn’t harmful to the formula, to
the balance of the bill. It is egregiously harmful to the balance of the
bill, and without trying to go into more depth, I will just say please
vote no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate.
Representative Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and
fellow House members, it’s clear that we are all human and we aren’t
perfect in what we do, and so to take an opportunity at this time in
part of the process to try and improve what we’re doing for the citizens
of North Carolina, certainly we should not take offence at that. We
should not shy away from that. We should say if we can do something to
change something to change this and make it better… and I understand
Representative Howard’s comment, that she says “Well let’s just do it
like it is and we’ll fix it later.” Well using that same principle,
that’s how we got to where we are, isn’t it? Didn’t we say “Let’s
continue to let the account balance go down and get into the negative,”
and “We’re going to fix it next year,” and “We’re going to fix it
later,” and “We’re going to fix it later”? And where did we end up?
Where we are now. And so I would ask that you think about how did we get
here, and are we repeating what we did before? If this is an opportunity
to improve the bill, if this is an opportunity to be fairer to the
citizens of North Carolina, then we should take that opportunity. If you
have 100% of the bill and 5% of it is wrong, you’ve got a 95% bill. If
you can improve it, if you can do something to make it better starting
out, then we won’t be repeating the mistakes of the past. I’d ask that
you support the amendment. Let’s try to make this better as it moves
forward. Certainly you have the votes for the bill, certainly this is a
small change, but let’s not be stuck on doing what we did in the past,
which was kick it down the road and say “We’ll come back and fix it
later.” We know it’s a problem, but we’ll come back and fix it later.
Let’s fix it now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?

Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, this is a simple and
sane amendment. It changes the date of the - well I was gonna call them
long-term benefits, emergency unemployment benefits. With the change
long-term benefits will continue to January 1, 14. Without this change
you're going to cut off $25 million dollars a week that flows into North
Carolina and it is 100% federal money.
If you don't make this date change that I'm proposing you're also gonna
cut off emergency benefits to 80,000 North Carolina families. And folks
if you don't think that emergency benefits are going to people who are
in emergency situations, let me tell you I see them all too often. My
county for one month , one month out of three and a half years came
under 9% employment. We did that in November. Guess what happened in
December? We went right back up. So I see a lot of long-term unemployed
and they are in emergency situations. And I suggest that you approve
this amendment, you will help these desperate North Carolina families.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the house, we
know that the votes are here to pass the bill as it is. But sometimes we
get caught up in a whole canopy of issues here and we forget about why
we are here. We forget about who sent us here. We forget about the
service that we are to run. Now this amendment that's been offered by
representative Wilkins is very simple. You've got 80.,000 people out
there who are drawing this emergency unemployment. It's not costing the
state of North Carolina one dime. But you've got 80,000 citizens, people
that you have come here and sworn that you would protect and defend.
These 80,000 people are our folks. So they are in need of these
emergency funds., you pass this bill as it is right now those funds are
cut, they have nothing except for what's left here. It's not gonna hurt
anybody to put this date off until such time as they will not lose those
benefits, which would be the end of the year as outlined in the relief
act signed by congress. Folks think about the people. We're gonna pass
the bill anyway, but just think about those 80,000 folks out there who
are gonna be lost, who are gonna lose that emergency relief. I ask you
support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley please state your
purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ladies and gentleman this is a tough issue. I'd like
to commend representative Howard and her committee for the work they've
done. But we talk about helping people that are out of work and I've
even referred to as a permanent unemployment. The only reasons it's
permanent unemployment, representative Wilkins I believe used the term a
while ago, they've been out of work for three and a half years, 80,000
of them out of work for three and a half years, $25 million dollars in
benefits. If we put up that $25 - if we don't keep the bill like it is
somebody's got to pay that...</p>

The thing to remember is this we all pay federal taxes. When a law past

will not be able to get something that is entitled to us, under the bill

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, it  is my understanding that even those are
currently covered on extended benefits will be cut off on this date. But
the reason they will be cut off. Is because the same federal government,
that's done nothing for four years to help create jobs. Pass a bill
January the 2nd and signed into law. That North Carolina or any other
state for that matter, tries to take action, to alleviate the problem or
correct the problem or pay off there debt. then the federal government
is going to cut off the funding. So they pass law to tell us  we have to
spend the money, to correct their problem. if the federal government and
the people who feel so strongly about keeping people unemployed. And
that's the way I look at it. Then let the federal government pay this
debts. Thank you.

not been looking for a job. I can tell you four, five, six, or seven
right in Durham County. That have been looking for job what years. That
have not been able to do it. I know folks that have basically taken jobs
at McDonald and other places. Who hold a degrees. Who can't  get a job.
Now folks this people hurt. Six months you gonna cut them off. They
should be able to get that money. Is 25 million dollars a week coming
into our economy. That we, people get. It does two things it boost our
economy, and it gives this people an opportunity to continue looking for
the job. you want them to lose there homes and who you want them to lose

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't want to spread the blame for the situation were in. we have
offered several amendments to try to soften the burden on who pays for
it again. this is an insurance plan, paid for by the employers in our
state and I was here in some of those years back whenever are are a
trust fund was reasonably healthy, but we realize it was not ready for a
recession, but on the eve of that recession. we also could not find the
consensus in the body to raise the rates as that recession began to
unfold in front of us. so what happened is over the last forty years,
North Carolina has benefited the employers of North Carolina
administrated in lower premiums. we are full in favorability in
unemployment insurance rights of all the states in America, so we had
very favorable rates through this recession, but now it's time to pay
the debt. so what we what this bill are looking at doesn't does favor
that the debt is I believe I know I'm not from the employers which is
the intent of the nineteen thirty five, until the video world that was
partnered with the states and the federal government with the Social
Security act and the unemployment act of nineteen thirty five to
stabilize unemployment where citizens are not communities across this

To a fair system for our citizens with a reasonable, a common sense and
decency tells us that this recession is long and deep and many of us
know people are hurting. That's why the 26 weeks has been reasonable
it's been reasonable for decades in North Carolina. We realize that it
is hard to make it on 44 percent of the average, that average, 44
percent of the average salary in North Carolina will be our cap if we
don't go back. Going back to 66 percent of the average is not ??, is not
excessive so whenever we get this debt paid, let's be fair with our
citizens and go back to those, those previous perditions in North
Carolina where we indeed protected our workforce and our communities and
our families from something that like any insurance policy nobody wants
to use. In the, before the recession North Carolina was always in the
top two, three, four states in the number of people who took
unemployment and how quickly they went back to work. We can get back to
that if we indeed focus on creating jobs in this state and working
together to do that, but to say that this is a job's bill when all it
does is cut unemployment benefits, I think that's a little disingenuous
and we can at least fix it when we get the debt paid back to something
that we can be proud of in the state, so I recommend the amendment to
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's
rather disappointing to hear the members say that the only thing the
bill does is cut benefits that isn't true and I don't believe that the
member meant that in the context that it was stated but I'm bringing it
back if you have a paper copy of your bill or if you can pull it up on
your screens to section 10 of this bill and four members of this body,
four of ya, will be appointed by our speaker to scrutinize the changes,
what impact they have, how things need to play out totally in the bill
not just the benefit changes, not just the 26 weeks but the entire
portions of the bill the bill intact. Now I'm going to ask you to vote
no on this amendment because we don't know as I stated in my opening
remarks, things change, people change, circumstances change. That is the
purpose of having this very active joint committee. I ask you to vote
no, if you want to get involved sign yourself up to be a member of this

[Representative Adams]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Speak on the Bill please.
[Speaker]: The lady is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Representative Adams]: Thank you Mr. Speaker, Members of the House.
This is certainly not a difficult choice for me. I’ve heard from a lot
of citizens in Gilford County and throughout this State, who really
believe that we’re doing the wrong thing. I agree with them.
I want to appeal to you tonite for some compassion for the thousands of
people who will be hurt by this Bill. I guess if you have a job and you
make $30, $40 thousand dollars a year, whatever you make and you loose
that job, then you’re reduced to taking a benefit of $300 or $500 a
week. It’s still not enough for you to make ends meet for your family.
I’m asking you to have some compassion for families who, we’re asking
now to get by, food, clothing, whatever else they need to do, because
many of them who are unemployed don’t have any additional income at all.
This is a severe cut that we’re proposing. In other states, I’ve done
some research and no other state has ever made such a severe cut. We’re
punishing innocent people who don’t deserve it.
Reducing the number of weeks. This is a double whammy to folks. You’re
reducing the number of weeks that persons can receive benefits. You’re
reducing the amount that they can get. We’re cutting off emergency
support that may be available for them. North Carolina, yes, we do need
to stabilize this unemployment compensation fund, but this is not the
way to do it.
I want again to appeal to you tonite to vote against this Bill. I know
it’s on a fast track as we say around here, but I think we need to be
careful about whom we penalize. Many of who are the least of these. We
should not forget those unemployed workers who once provided support for
our economy. Paid taxes and did all the things that many of us have been
privileged to do.
And they’ve been sort of caught as innocent victims. Victims of
circumstances. Circumstances around an economy that was on a downward
spiral, struggling to make a come back. Circumstances around jobs that
are no longer available in North Carolina.
I want to appeal to you tonite to listen to the people that sent you
here. Many of them are, some of them are Democrats, some of them are
Republicans, but they’re all struggling. I would ask that you would
think about those people. Let’s put people over profits tonite. Vote
against this Bill.
[Speaker]: Representative [??], please state your purpose.
[Representative [??]]: Speak on the Bill.
[Speaker]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Representative [??]]: Thank you Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. I
understand the speakers admonition that we have tomorrow to debate this
also. But this is just such a topic that is so easy to demogog and a few
things do need to be addressed from the start.
I’ve already read reports in the press that just can’t quite seem to get
the essence of this right. I don’t know if that’s purposeful or just
accidental, but something I can gather just from what some of the
Members have said today, this evening, some don’t realize that one of
the essences of this Bill is to keep a rather large tax on North
Carolina employers on their, that they get burdened for by having
employees.
This is a tax on employers for having employees. There is a programmed
increase that’s rather hefty coming in the future. If you want to create
more unemployed out there in the future, just try not addressing this
problem some more. I don’t know if there’s a purposeful design to
deceive, but there’s been some things that have in effect have been
deceptive tonite, I do want</p>

The members that, that brought this subject up can, if they've got as
many facts as they spewed out from this report, this projection done by
our staff, then they must know some of the other figures that they've
left off. I've heard a couple of times the one hundred to one. It's one
hundred to one unemployed, burdened on the unemployed versus the
employer. Now that comes from reading one column on SUTA, state
unemployment tax from this report and totally leaving out another column
on FUTA, which is the entire purpose of the bill is to stop some of the
FUTA increases in the future from occurring, and they leave off the
eight hundred million that is projected from the FUTA. So that one
hundred to one is totally false and I believe is designed to get that
somewhere out there in the public and in the press and in peoples' minds
so it just looks cruel and heartless. And I hear that motif over and
over on issue and issue that you guys can't really be serious about
doing this, you're just so heartless. And the heartlessness is not doing
something about a problem that you might hear the term we inherited.
I've heard that term for several years now, at the national level, if
you will look at a handout, for, that I had distributed, now this
problem is partly of our own making. If you will look back in January of
2009, there was nothing owed. And as we went through 2009, February,
March, April, May, June, July, that year the legislature did not get out
until August. There was almost a billion dollars in debt run up while we
were in session. Now, I think it was sometime around April or maybe even
March that Governing Magazine had an article about how this problem was
arising and I don't think that we were unaware of it. And Representative
Luebke, you were one of the chairs of the finance committee as this debt
materialized, and I didn't see any attempt to address it. And it is a
shame that members here are having to take this difficult vote this
early in the session, this is the fourth legislative day, seventy
percent plus are in their first or second year. Had this legislature
acted, they wouldn't have to be taking this tough vote on this issue and
it, it's just a shame. And to hear members from the other side talk
about kicking the can down the road, it's just rather disconcerting now.
We're also hearing no other sate has done this. This is just draconian.
There was another handout given out in finance committee on Thursday
that shows North Carolina has the third highest debt owed to the federal
government behind California and New York. Oh, we're gonna get out, none
of our South Eastern states have had to cut their benefits or do any of
this, but Florida's, a rather large state, is only six hundred and
eighty four hundred in debt. South Carolina is six hundred and seventy
five million, and the rest of Southern states trail that so North
Carolina is three and four and five times what's happened in the other
states. So we have a much bigger problem. That's why we're having to
take bigger steps to fix it. So there is a valid reason behind doing
what we're doing. Is this a balanced approach? I would point out that
the, this figure on how balanced it is between the unemployed and the
employer is just a projection. There is no way to tell in two hundred
and, in 2016 and 2017 what the unemployment rate is gonna be, who's
gonna be unemployed. This program is designed to give temporary
assistance, not pay everybody's bill, give temporary assistance for
twenty six weeks. Now we're cutting that to twenty, but you gotta
remember the average duration is only sixteen weeks. Not everybody who
qualifies gets twenty six weeks. So it's been exaggerated how much this
affects the future unemployed, and that's another thing to remember.
This bill is affecting people who become unemployed as far as the
benefit structure after July first 2013, it's not affecting benefit-wise
those who are currently on unemployed, unemployment.</p>

of course, all of you are entitled not to vote on any matter. But we’re
trying to do that to make the process as expedient as possible.
Representative Davis, please state your purpose.

Mr. Speaker, just had a question. If members mistakenly voted their
conscience, are they going to be allowed to change their votes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair’s always open to members changing their votes. Incidentally,
on the day of the session and not the following day. Ladies and
gentlemen, this completes the calendar for today. We’ll go to notices
and announcements. A couple, or one other housekeeping matter, right
now, is the intent of the Chair to hold session tomorrow at 2 p.m. and
on Wednesday at 2 p.m. Currently, we’re planning for 1 p.m. on Thursday,
but the Chair is trying to work with committee members and others to see
if we can move that earlier in the day. And we will, we will attempt to
do that as much as possible, particularly earlier in the session. But at
this point, please plan for 1 p.m. It will be no later than that, and it
may possibly be earlier. Notices and announcements. Representative
Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One announcement.

staff make some presentations on the overall environment, which our
budget is operating some past history and the like. We will have a
similar session, probably looking at revenue</p>
