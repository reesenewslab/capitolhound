Good afternoon. The quorum being present, the House Committee on
Transportation is now in session. The sergeants at arms serving us today
are Bob Rossi, Doug Hanes, Barry Moore, and Billy Jones. Our pages
today: Jamal Hall from Durham, Joshua Garner from Randolph County, Miles
Heath from Wake, and John Hodges from Wake. Thank you for your service
today. First item on the agenda today, House Bill 211, Weight Limits
Animal Feed Trucks. Representative Dixon is recognized to present the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee.
I’d like to thank Representative Brisson, Representative John Bell and
Representative Larry Bell for joining me on this piece of legislation.
Members of the committee, House Bill 211 makes an addition to
legislation that we passed in the last session, in Subsection 3A adding
feed, processed feed that is delivered to poultry or livestock from a
storage facility, holding facility or mill, to a farm. It’s an important
piece of legislation for our livestock producers throughout North
Carolina, in that it gives us an additional method of staying
competitive with those who are closer to the supply of the ingredients
for feed. I consulted with the highway patrol up front, Lieutenant Hook
is here should any of you have any questions of him. I’ll be glad to
answer any questions concerning this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Are there any questions for the sponsor? Representative Shephard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to make a motion at the appropriate
time, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay thank you chairman. Mr. Torbitt? Okay,
are there any comments? Your motion’s in order, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to make a motion that we approve this bill and I forward it to
the next committee, if there is one? Mr. Chair, agriculture. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So the motion is favorable to the bill, with referral to
Agriculture. So many as favor the motion, say aye. All opposed. Thank
you for an excellent presentation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you members
of the committee. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] A brilliant job of
presenting the bill, if I’ve ever seen one. House Bill 109,
Representative Torbitt’s recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe we have a proposed Committee Substitute on
motion of Representative Shafer. The substitute is now before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just like to kind of rehash very briefly some of the
discussion that went on. As you know, the origins of this was a helmet
law was implemented or mandated by the state government of North
Carolina because it was an access to federal funds, years ago. That
later was proved unnecessary. A lot of states, 31 of 50, chose to exile
that and to have choice in their wearing of helmets. So 31 of 50
currently have that. Some of the other reasons is statistical
differences in fatality between freedom of choice states and universal
helmet law states are miniscule. That shows that the helmet is not the
answer. Of the top five most expensive states for vehicle insurance,
four of them have or mandate the helmet law. Of the five least expensive
states for vehicle insurance, four of them are choice states. Of the top
twelve states most expensive states for inpatient hospital expenses, 7
of 12 have the helmet law. Five are choice states. Of the twelve least
expensive states for inpatient hospital expenses, 4 have a universal
helmet law, 8 are choice states. So as you can see as we discuss, that
some of the information it just makes good common sense about the helmet
but when it comes to factual data, it’s just not supported. Also at the
last meeting it was brought forward about our Governor’s health safety
task force, Governor Safety Task Force, it was mentioned that</p>

Cityscapes and a writer surveyed agreed with the current helmet all and
give you a breakdown that will and anybody in this rent pretty much
understand how polls are and there were 200,000 licensed motorcycles and
North Carolina study interviewed 601 license drivers subsidence and most
only 43 of these people reported they were licensed operators of
Microsoft so essentially the response right you got was 43 out of 600
and anything they would motorcycle sign that they do support motorcycle
of that is you that here once again those numbers are pretty much I just
is really not supported and I will finish up with take a point in my
present herself here last two mins ago.scheme he was emphatic that what
you members of the committee notice because he might statement he went
back to check this statement and statement made was that currently three
states mandate insurance and he the least him your email very apologetic
he was incorrectly found that only two states mandate insurance partly
in one of those a $10,000 without close share request represented more
of Mecklenburg Bakula musculus love quick comment and emotional it is
appropriate have the skeletal thought about it at first you know I was
in favor with bill first came here with people 18 years in and under
would be required compulsory of 21 I would understand and I'm in favor
would be my preference is I will ride a motorcycle without Dylan in
several years many years that I've always wore a little helmet to
protect myself but when you look at a person's right send endear of an
and you have a right to decide whether he wants to wear and 21 eight
they should be able to make a reasonable decision whether they want
aware of Hellman a not so I will Oedipal every time I will like to make
a most representative claim represented Brisson thinkest you all imagine
the insurance is that medical ensures that required hours ago Leo are
slow or the Shiite telephone noninsured just to stay the accepted
liabilities and responsibilities of the individual whatever about health
website for the they accept motor vehicle accidents of which cars are
the largest things they accept pedestrians which are just number
motorcycle so it it is just no barren bicycle so, question follow-up
searches this insures visit to the above include medical insurance that
the latest to get is my medical insurance side effect that did not lead
so they would be made noninsured all interested in what we can only hope
that's correct you know a course we have uninsured in the four wheeled
vehicles now North Carolina when you understand insurance but I guess
the the the law is that it's is for licensure pedagogical terminology
this follow up to what the other person was asking as I read this you'll
have that insurance if you Ryland after helmet represented Blackwell
find this chairman I'm not sure if this is sure if she told her for
staff is I understand the bill now, somebody convicted of violating the
statute wants its amended would be committing an infraction and I would
pay $25.50 for violating the statute that they would be exempted from
paying court costs my questionnaires if reading is correct what other
infractions do we similarly exempt from paying court costs for example I
assume that not wearing your seatbelt I am a car is an infraction are
they exempted from court costs or</p>

<p id="10:00">
Are there other infractions exempted from court cost? Do you have an
answer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right we're going to give him a minute to find it.
Would it be all right if I allowed Representative Shepard to ask his
question while we wait? Thank you. Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My question was concerning the same issue.
Representative Torbett, why did that come into play just for the court
cost? Could you share with us why this came into play exempt ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] An effort to not clog the court system. It to be
pretty much a simple citation. That was the intent. So in other words
you pretty much pay a ticket and there is no court cost, other than just
the maintenance for doing the ticket.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there other-- Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chair. I have a question going back
to the - and I may have missed this because I did come in a few minutes
late and I apologize if I did - the $10,000 of medical benefits. Where
did we come up with that $10,000 number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Starnes that was to
simulate, for example, State of Florida that allowed the bill to move
forward once people felt reassured there was some insurance attached to
that law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you have any objections to raising that number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually we based off the states that have it, and
10,000 is the only common of the 2 of 31 that actually mandate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? Yes, Mr. Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Finish up on Representative Starnes. I have no problem
lowering it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Chairman. Having served on the state public
health commission, I have concerns about the cost to the public of
long-term brain injuries. Having had a motorcycle myself, and wearing a
helmet it saved my life before. I do respect your bill, but I probably
will be voting no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I do, I want to respond to
my colleague if I may before I ask my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ?? recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I really don't think that's a road that we want to go
down on, because every single year there are people who don't care of
their health. They don't take their high blood pressure medication. They
don't look after their diabetes. They eat a piece of cake at every meal.
We are always going to pay for irresponsible people. I think that not to
vote for this bill because of that is really going down the wrong road.
We don't want to start going there. That's my comment. My question is:
how do we know if someone's 21 years old or younger? Is there going to
be any way - and maybe I missed this comment, I apologize - but is there
going to be anyway to differentiate between who's 21 and who's younger?
Thank you, Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently in the-- oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I tell you what I was
told. A policeman is a trained observer. And they do a real good at the
job and the function that they serve to the public. When it comes down
to 1 year, it's often times just obviously to determine, especially with
a helmet on, if a person's 21 or not 21. With a helmet off, of course
that becomes much easier. But even so there would still be some
apprehension as to gauging the age. So I would allow on the police
officer as a trained observer, as the courts will tell you that's what
they do. That's a large part of their function is they are more highly
skilled in the aspect of observation, that we lead it to their guidance.
And should it present a problem, there is a simple remedy. And the
remedy would be a notation on a license tag of the vehicle, something
that would discern them based on 21 years of age. And I didn't
incorporate that. I'm thinking that if police come back in a couple of
years and say, &quot;Hey, look. There's a problem that we can't really
tell.&quot; Then we can take it to the next step and just make a
different colored plate or something.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Staff has an answer to Representative
Blackwell's question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's my understanding that you were asking about
whether people convicted or found responsible for infractions pay court
cost. The seatbelt law, the driver of the vehicle.</p>

He’s responsible for court costs. The fine is 25 dollars and 50 cents.
But they are responsible for court costs. The rear seat occupant who
violates the provision whose an adult is not responsible for court costs
and is subject on to a fine. Speeding is an infraction and there are
court costs in those instances. So it depends on the particular
infraction and as to whether or not the person has to pay court costs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Carter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So are you suggesting that you all haven’t done an exhaustive search but
there may be other examples of infractions exemptive of court cost?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct. There’s no general exemption of infractions from court
costs. So there may be some other instances where the infractions are
not subject to court costs. But I can’t identify them at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Except for the one about someone in the rear seat of a car
who is not wearing a seat belt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. Well, we looked at the seat belt statute just because that was
one that we knew is an infraction that may or may not carry court costs
and we found that it did have court costs for the driver but not for the
occupant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was part of my question was what the seat belt infraction was in
terms of who pays what. And I think that answers my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Gill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I’m looking again at the medical insurance. The 10,000
dollars at least, for insurance policy if you’re a rider or a operator.
What if the rider does not have insurance? I mean as there a penalty for
either not having insurance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The only answer I have for you would be the 25 dollars and 50 cent fine.
I would guess for an infraction to that law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Chairman. I would just comment to that that I think
the 25 and 50 is adequate. I mean, if the person driving the motorcycle
chooses not to wear a helmet, if anything happens, he’s not hurting
anybody but himself. If he has a passenger and they either have a helmet
on or they don’t, that’s their responsibility, I would think. And so, I
don’t think anything beyond the 25.50 should be imposed on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion. Representative Moore moves. Favorable to the
proposed committee substitute for House Bill 109 on favorable to the
original bill with a referral to judiciary. Yes, Mr. Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize. I’m a freshman here, so I’m trying to learn the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s okay. We can still talk. You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I sure would like to vote for this but I think what gives me pause is
just simply the court costs and everything. I would love to support the
Bill in terms of the age of 21, but I want to put some teeth in it to
the ones who are underneath 21. And so for me, I think making the court
costs and the infraction a piece of that would be good. But I wanted to
get your thoughts, Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m a sophomore but it’s my guess that that debate will be carried on in
it’s entirety in judiciary. And if you allow it to go to judiciary
because I’ve been in that room before and they don’t let anything slide.
Most of the members are counselors of fine standing.
[SPEAKERS CHANGES]
So it seems like since you called for a motion, maybe mine is out of
order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Actually I never understood why we wait to finish the debate to make
the motion. I’ve always thought you have to have the motion before you
can debate it. So we’ll just follow the rules. I’ve got my little red
book like everybody else but mine’s not published by Chairman Meyer. Did
you have a further comment, Sir? Okay. Further discussion. Further
debate. The motion is approval of the proposed committee substitute,
with a referral to the judiciary. All in favor say “Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair believe the Ayes have it.</p>
