To debate the bill.

The gentleman has floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the house the title describes accurately the content of the
bill itself, most of you heard this and the Appropriation Committee, I
will differ to Representative McGrady for some further explanation with
regard to the Coal-Ash section and then Mr. Speaker I believe three or
four members have some amendments that they wish considered tonight for
the bill. I will be happy to answer any questions but I would refer
first to Representative McGrady to discuss the details of Coal-Ash
section.

  It was to make sure we had money sufficient to fund the ?? Management
Act to make one other small technical change. Those are reflected in
section 7 &amp; 8. In committee, those of you who were there, I amended
the bill to do two things. The ?? Management Act that we passed had a
whole set of previsions related to dam safety. Many of you may have
heard from your constitutions that they were surprised since they
didn&#39;t own a ?? basin of any type, that their dams were now being
deemed potentially subject to this legislation and that in fact they
might need to go out and get an engineer to do the engineering report.
The limits that are offered in committee that are sections, I believe 8,
and 9, and 10 do two things. One, they extend the deadline for owners of
 ?? higher and immediate hazard dams to submit an emergency action plan
until December 31st of this year rather than March 1st of this week.
Second, it clarifies that the EAP does not require a license engineer
necessarily to review, approve and stamp the report. That&#39;s the
substance there, they&#39;re relatively minor and very specific issue
that arose once we passed that legislation, and I urge your support for
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stan
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Stan moves to amend the bill on page 1 lines 2 through 3
by deleting the language.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman from Wake, Representative Stan has the floor to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the house. I&#39;ll save a long
explanation, if there are questions. The short explanation to strike
section one, because the purpose for section one has gone away. Section
one would of taken $100,000 essentially from conversions that we
wouldn&#39;t be able to spend next year to send to the rules review
commission for an extra set of lawyers. I&#39;m reliably informed that
the purpose of that was to defend claims 4, 6, 7, and 8 in this
particular law suit. A few days ago the plaintiff in that case dismissed
those claims and I&#39;m reliably informed they&#39;ll stay dismissed if
we pass this bill and the senate agrees to it. So, we saved $100,000
this week, on lawyers no less.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. For what purpose
does the gentleman from Pender, Representative Millis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Pender? Does
the gentleman wish to ask about the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Forgive me, Mr. Speaker, I&#39;ll turn my light off here and I&#39;ll
ask a question on the bill itself. I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Very well. Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? If not
the question before the house is amendment one offered by Representative
 Stan. Submitting in favor of adopting of the amendment will vote aye,
those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
lock the machine and record the vote. 110 having voted in the
affirmative and 4 in the negative, the amendment is adopted. For what
purpose does the gentleman from Pender, Representative Millis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Speaker, we&#39;re currently drafting an amendment that we&#39;ve
been working on here for some time, I just wanted to see if in the
course of the calendar if this is the last thing on the calendar or not.
We just need a little bit more time with staff to get the amendment
correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
How long does the gentleman think he&#39;s going to need before an
amendment is prepared?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We may need to ask Jeff Hudson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, well we&#39;ll . . . It is the chairs intent . . . I understand
the amendment the gentleman is looking at would require a title change,
so its the chairs intent that any amendments that would require title
change be done tonight, because what&#39;s going to happen is, its going
to cause the third reading to go over and this bill is time sensitive.
The chair will hold back on a delay but would ask the member to please
move as expeditiously as he can in preparation of the amendment. For
what purposes does the gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To see if Representative McGrady would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Does the gentleman from Henderson yield to the gentleman from Nash?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I yield.

  <p id="15:00">
  I began to receive some telephone calls from little old ladies who own
farm ponds and that kind of thing because they got this letter from ??
about this intermediate dam hazard and so forth. My question is this:
When I think of an intermediate, or what&#39;s the worst term that&#39;s
used, high hazard or whatever it&#39;s called, I&#39;m thinking of a dam
that could burst and kill people, or you know wash their houses away, or
all that kind of thing, what defines a high or intermediate hazard dam,
that I would have to have some kind of investigation for and give a
report for?
I&#39;m not technically capable of answering that question, maybe one of
the engineers among us could, but my understanding in layman&#39;s
terms, it&#39;s a function of different things.  One is, what if the dam
broke, what would be downstream?  So a lot of people, a lot of houses,
could lead to a higher classification of a dam.  And then also the age
of the dam, the type of the dam, all of the things that determine
whether the dam, how stable that dam is and how long it&#39;s going to
remain in place.  But it&#39;s a function of several different things.
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
I yield.
He yields.
I guess my other issue is, is this something we have just defined, is
this a new requirement, or a requirement that we&#39;re adding on new
people with the coal ash bill, that we signed into law last year? Is
this something we just didn&#39;t realize we were doing?  We&#39;re
requiring a lot more dam owners to have to be investigated than used to
be or not?
The short answer to your question is yes.  When the bill came to the
floor, you may remember I said that, to my knowledge, there was only one
provision in the bill that was broader than the coal ash management
issue that we were facing.  It turned out that there were two.  How it
got there, it came over originally in the governor&#39;s proposal, was
put in the Senate bill, and of course that&#39;s what we took up.  It
wasn&#39;t a clear understanding that the dam safety provisions were
being changed, not just to affect the coal ash basins, but in fact to
affect a broader set of dams.  That was, that fact became clear during
the ERC process, and because you and others among us had constituents
that received this letter.  So yes, it was a surprise.
Let&#39;s take a break for a little bit.
The gentleman from Nash has the floor to debate the bill.
I&#39;m still not really sure how I&#39;m going to vote on this bill,
but I&#39;m also still kind of shocked that it is something that I
didn&#39;t know I was doing to my constituents when I voted for this
coal ash bill that we passed last year.  And, not being an engineer, I
didn&#39;t realize what kind of consternation I was going to cause a lot
regular old people that have dams that in my opinion, my humble opinion
even though I&#39;m not an engineer like my seatmate, really don&#39;t
cause much real hazard to anybody.  If the dam broke, it might be a
little bit of water on somebody else&#39;s property that they don&#39;t
particularly like, till it rolls off or dries up, but certainly not
enough to kill anybody or float their house away or anything like that.
So I would really like to see us at some point, I don&#39;t think this
bill does it, I don&#39;t know if Representative Mills&#39; amendment
may do it, but I&#39;d like to see us repeal that portion of the bill
that we&#39;ve pushed down on the people of North Carolina where if
you&#39;ve got some kind of farm pond, you&#39;ve got to get it
investigated every year and be considered a hazard to your neighbors and
so forth.
What purpose does the gentleman from Forsyth, Representative Lambeth,
rise?
Send forth an amendment.
Gentlemans recognize to send forth an amendment ??
Representative Lambeth moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 13, by
deleting the word &quot;and&quot;
The gentleman from Forsyth has the floor to debate the amendment.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen. This came up after our
preparations committee meeting last week, so I apologize for that, but I
think it is appropriate that we take action.  This amendment actually
requires a performance audit of Medicaid eligibility determinations by
county departments of social services.  We will be recommending to
reallocate $300,000 in the budget that was for personal care services
study that will not be done over to the state auditor to perform these
audits, and you can see in sections 11-5 what we&#39;ve asked them to
do.  This is absolutely critical as a part of our Medicaid reform
efforts as we&#39;re positioning to move forward with that effort that
we know how well our counties are performing, so I recommend this
amendment for your approval.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, this was an over siding in the Coal, I mean the
mine energy bill. Basically, all of this does is a technical change that
allows the Mine Energy Commission to look at the statement of Federal
guidelines on air toxic, and if they are adequate they use I mean if not
they adopt their own. We just didn’t allow them to look to State and
Federal air toxin programs so they could use it. That’s all the
amendment does.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you guys for your patience here. What
you see on your dashboard here is within the intent of Representative
Collins, what actually happened last session in recording these EAPs,
there is little kind of discrepancy between Deener and the actual board
of engineering about what will be required to actually have an engineer
see or not, we are actually specifying in the legislation that only the
actual EAPs associated with the Coal-Ash empowerments would require an
engineer CO in all of the ones would not, and also there is a provision
for Deener to actually work along side of the actual board to discuss
this matter and move forward if any corrections need to be made. So it
actually roles back a little bit of the increase regulation that
Representative Collins and all of us aware about of the EAPs but more
aligned with our principles here. So I will answer any questions you may
have and thank you again for you time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson Representative
McGrady raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m okay with the amendment, I just want to make clear though that in
the Coal-Ash Management Act we put in place the requirement of EAP, EAPs
meeting with dams whether they were Coal-Ash dams, with Coal-Ash dams or
not. This amendment will provide that engineers are only required with
respect to the Coal-Ash Management dams. And therefore, there are gonna
be some high hazardous dams that will have an EAP and may or may not
have an engineer who puts it together. Now, some of maybe cause for
concern and I certainly understand that cause but I think in the
practical world…

involved and why is that because engineers carry insurance for what they
do and when they put together the EAP required under the Dam Safety Act,
if you have got something that’s really pretty dangerous you are not
gonna wanna throw together an EAP create one of ability for yourself
than you otherwise would might well have had. I think it’s the practical
matter, this is a good middle ground and I would also stand and tell you
that this is a position that the Senate is fully supported. So I think I
can get the bill back over there and perhaps I get it in place before we
hit our first deadlines so I recommend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate on the amendment? If not the question
before the house is the passage of amendment 4 offered by Representative
Millis, so many favoring passage of the amendment will vote aye, those
oppose will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock
the machine and record the vote, 91 having voted in the affirmative and
23 in the negative, the amendment is adopted. Further discussion further
debate on the bill as amended? If not the question before the house is
the passage of the House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 14 on its
second reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will vote aye,
those oppose will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
lock the machine and record the vote, 113 having voted in the
affirmative and one in the negative, the House Committee Substitute for
Senate Bill 14 passes its second reading and will remain on the
calendar. Members and the Chair I want to restate and email that was
send earlier today in a formal way as we mentioned early in session we
talk about having a formal spring recess for the house something that
hasn’t happened before and that was a request that came from both sides
to give folks an opportunity to actually plan trips and do these sorts
of things, and what we have decided to do is to make the week of April
to sixth of that week here and which I believe corresponds with most of
the spring breaks around the state assuming we don’t have any more
blizzards or anything. That’s the week we will do and so the way we will
do this is, we will simply make it a no vote week, or no vote session
that week. So members will be encouraged, if members all here working
then they should draw for days, as they normally would, for those
members who aren’t here those days are obviously would be encourage not
to draw on those days but for your planning purposes you can count on
that week of April 6 has being a no vote week for the spring recess. The
