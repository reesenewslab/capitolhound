Thank you Mr. Speaker. I had an opportunity to read the Senate rules, we

we need to point that out and kindly return the bill to them so they can
actually take proper action on the bill. So I move that the bill be
returned to the Senate for appropriate action.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House come to order. Representative Setzer, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, as we travel along life's road, we often miss opportunities to
acknowledge the accomplishments of those around us. And also while we
are on that road, we often see a gray and black car approaching us in
the rear view mirror and we pray in advance that our actions have not
triggered that response.
However, today presents us with an opportunity to formerly thank the
members of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol for 85 years of
dedicated and devoted service to the citizens of the State of North
Carolina.
The professional, steadfast and devoted actions exercised by those brave
men and women who serve on the patrol are worthy of our appreciation and
gratitude. Not everyone is called upon to sustain the duties and
obligations that these brave men and women have chosen to bear. But with
grace and purpose, the members of the North Carolina State Highway
Patrol meet the challenges without hesitation or mental reservation. And
for that, we would like to say thank you and may the blessings of God
always attend you.
Therefore, in honor and recognition of the North Carolina State Highway
Patrol and its 85th anniversary and its members, a State flag has been
flown over the State Capitol in honor of the patrol on behalf of all
members of the North Carolina House of Representatives. I commend the
resolution to you. And this flag will...</p>

Presented. May be presented to the command staff at the earliest
possible occasion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I rise just to read the names of four highway patrolmen who
have given their last full measure in the line of duty from my county,
from 1985. Trooper Giles Harmon, shot in the line of duty April 1985.
Trooper Calvin Taylor, died in a tragic roadside accident in the line of
duty, 2001. Trooper Anthony Greg Cogdill killed in a tragic roadside
accident in the line of duty, May 2003. And Trooper Shawn Blanton shot
in the line of duty June 2008. That’s just four good, solid law
enforcement officers in one troop in Haywood County. These men gave
their lives and their honor and their duty to this state and I recommend
their resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pittman,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I tell you, I so admire
highway patrol. When I was a little kid, I wanted to be either a game
warden or a highway patrolman. But the good Lord said, well this boy’s
going to spend too much time in the woods hunting and fishing anyway so
we can’t make him a game warden, and he’s not going to tall enough so we
can’t make him a highway patrolman. So I’ll just make him a preacher
instead. And I had just always appreciated their work, and when I was
16, I was making a left turn and I hit the signal switch, but it didn’t
stick and I went ahead and made the turn anyway. And a patrolman pulled
me, and I know he got the shock of his life when this 16 year old kid
thanked him for doing his job and giving me that ticket. That’s just how
strongly I feel about what they do. That they’re out there to protect
us, to make our roads safe, and these people every day when they get in
that car, they turn on that blue light, or even just going out to go to
work in the morning, they don’t know that somebody might be shooting at
them before the day’s over. And you know, if I was facing that every
day, I might have to think twice about that profession but they go out
and face that and do that for our well-being and our safety. And I am
just proud to vote for this resolution and I thank them so much for
their devotion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You know as a Chairman of Transportation, I get a lot of
comments about highway patrol and I’ll tell you something that’s
universal. People say they are polite. They are professional. And they
give you the ticket, because if you deserved it, you’re going to get it.
What I also know is people, particularly women that have talked to me
about being broken down on the road at night, if a car pulls up next to
them, if it’s black and silver, they relax. Of all the law enforcement
agencies I know, the one that nobody distrusts is the highway patrol.
And I’m grateful for what they do and grateful for the chance to vote
for this resolution and let them know how grateful we are for the image
they project for our state and for the protection they provide for our
highways. Thank you gentlemen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As a country
person, one who lives in the rural area of North Carolina, I’ve always
appreciated that uniform and that black and silver car. When I was in
college, I remember going on a trip and if I’m not mistaken, I got a
ticket on that trip for speeding. And I think I ignored it. But then one
day, we lived back up in the ??</p>

...it was in the country, in the woods. And one day a trooper came to my
Mom's house looking for me. He was very kind. He was very stately. And I
can't remember whether he said it to my mother or whether he went back
and said it to somebody else, but he was coming back in that woods to
look for Annie Ward.
He got there and this big 2-story house that we lived in was not a
pretty place back there. But the word went out that as he went back
there and drove back about a half a mile into the woods looking for
Annie Ward. The house that he came upon was immaculately clean. We
didn't like the house but we couldn't do much better than what we were
doing.
But as he talked about how clean that place was that he came to visit
looking for me, he was, again like I said, very kind. And he thanked my
mother for what she had done in terms of rearing, not only me but the
other brothers and sisters in our home. And I don't think I'll ever
forget that.
And as I came to prepare to come here, my son was approved to be a
highway patrolman and even though he did not make his rank that he
wanted to make earlier today, he is still excited about being a highway
patrolman and remains positive about what it is that he wants to do. And
I can let you know that he must have tried it about three times to be a
highway patrolman.
So to the members of the highway patrol, I say thank you for allowing my
son to serve in your ranks and I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I have a unique opportunity, not only to
work with the highway patrol with the appropriations with the Justice of
Public Safety here, but also professionally. We live in a rural county
and the funeral home, we have the medical examiner's contract. And I can
tell you that when we go to car accidents, the highway patrol is there
and they have the hardest job of having to go and notify the families of
the death. But they've always been very professional, compassionate and
most of the times they'll put the family in their cars and bring them to
our office where they could identify their loved ones.
I have the utmost respect for them and the toughest job to me would be
go to knock on the door of the family of the person that has just passed
away and to tell them that their child has been in a car accident or
their loved one. So I commend the resolution and thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the resolution, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think all of us in here will
agree that the first and foremost priority of government is to protect
the safety and the security of our citizens. For without that, we would
have literally nothing else.
Ladies and gentlemen, at the state level, the highway patrol are those
individuals, they are at the tip of a spear. And I think it's wonderful
that we honor them today for they should be cherished each and every day
for the safety and security they provide to each and every one of us and
our folks back home. And I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know over the years when
I've hired a lot of young fellows and young ladies to become law
enforcement officers, fully 50% of the ones that I talk to when I ask
them what their goal in life was to be, they said I want to get a little
bit of experience with a police agency and then I want to go with the
North Carolina Highway Patrol.
And that spoke over time to me an awful lot of pride, an awful lot of
admiration, an awful lot of the good things about a law enforcement
agency...</p>

<p id="020:00">
very positive thoughts from young people who were looking up to go to
the North Carolina Highway Patrol. I also had a personal experience that
told me a lot about the character of folks in the Highway Patrol when I
went out to the University of Louisville back in 1967 and was a
classmate with a fellow named Major Lee Lance of the North Carolina
Highway Patrol, and he was my classmate out there at the Southern Police
Institute. We were out there a semester together and I got to know him
so well, and we’d sit around at night and talk about police stories and
Highway Patrol stories, and one of them, I’ll never forget, just shows
you how innovative those Highway Patrol officers are. Lee always had a
smile on his face, and he was telling me that one day he was the only
trooper between Asheville and the Tennessee line, and it was a Sunday
morning, and he was telling me if they weren’t busy, if a sheriff got a
call and didn’t have a deputy to go on a call, they would help out, so
he said the call went out that there was a fight at the church up on a
certain hill, and so he was close by so he contacted… I think at that
time they were using phones in the cars. Anyway, he contacted him and
said he’d take care of it. Lee said he drove over there to the church
and pulled up to the edge of the yard there and they were fighting like
mad. Said there was four or five different groups and they were knocking
each other down and kicking each other around, so he said about all he
could do, he yelled at them and they didn’t pay any attention, so he
said he picked out three and he walked over and put them under arrest,
took them over to his car, put them in his car, and he climbed in the
car and they started driving off. He was asking them who they were and
what was going on and all that, and about halfway toward the jailhouse
where he was taking them, one of them looked at the other one and said
“Why are we letting him take us to jail?” He said “There’s three of us;
there’s only one of him,” and I said “Well Lee, what did you do then?”
He said “Well I just pulled the car over at the side of the road and got
out and pulled out my revolver,” and I said “Well what were you going to
do?” He said “Well I knew what I was going to do but they didn’t,” and
he said they suddenly looked at each other and said “Wait a minute! What
are you doing?” He said “Well I’ve got to shoot you. I can’t fight all
three of you,” and he said they looked at each other and said “Oh man,
get back in the car. We’re just kidding,” and he took them on to jail.
So those guys are not only sharp and they’re looked up to, but they’re
very innovative in certain moments as well. I commend the resolution to
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Turner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady
is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank the
sponsors of this resolution and I agree with all the comments that have
been made, but as a retired Clerk of Superior Court, I just wanted to
commend them on their accuracy and how much time they’ve saved, time and
energy they’ve saved, to other state employees, and I appreciate their
willingness to be helpful and professional in their attitudes. Thank
you. Commend the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Goodman,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, in 1957, maybe the most notorious criminal in the history of
North Carolina shot and killed a Highway Patrolman in Richmond County;
his name was J. L. Reese. Then he drove to Lee County where he killed
another Highway Patrolman; I believe his name was James Brown. Then he
made his way out to California, and my father was a sheriff in Richmond
County at the time and had to go out to California and extradite him
back to North Carolina for trial. Well he got a life sentence in
Richmond County and he got a life sentence in Lee County, and he served
57 years in Central Prison, longer than anybody has ever served in
prison in North Carolina. I just want to say he deserved every day of it
and I recommend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further
discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the House is the
adoption of the House Committee Substitute of House Resolution 1227. All
in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 117 having voted in

Committee Substitute for house Resolution 1227. The resolution will be

Greene, Craven county, the Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of
the gallery to the best commissioner of agriculture in the United
States, our own Steve Troxler. Steve, please stand and let us welcome

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Resolution 1269. House resolution honoring the memory of George
Foster Peabody and James Beard in expressing appreciation for their
contributions to, and influence on, American culture. The House
resolves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative John Bell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask that the resolution be read in its entirety and to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read the resolution in its entirety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas George Foster Peabody was a successful investment banker,
philanthropist and benefactor of the University of Georgia. Whereas the
Peabody Award, named for George Foster Peabody, acknowledges excellence
in radio, television and web storytelling and is considered by many in
the broadcast industry to be the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize.
Whereas the prestigious Peabody award is awarded each year by the Grady
College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of
Georgia. Whereas James Beard was a renowned cookbook author, cooking
show host, restaurant owner and cooking instructor whose name is
synonymous with American cuisine. Whereas James Beard served as the host
of the first television food show and went on to inspire countless
others to take an interest in the culinary arts. Whereas, each year, the
James Beard Foundation Awards are given for excellence in the food and
beverage and related industries. Whereas the legacies of George Foster
Peabody and James Beard have made it possible for Vivian Howard and Ben
Knight to be inspired to create delicious foods with local agricultural
products and to share their creations with others through their
restaurants and television show. Whereas in 2006 Vivian Howard, a native
of Deep Run, North Carolina, and her husband Ben Knight, a Chicago
native and professional artist, opened a high-end barn-to-fork
restaurant in Kinston that serves the seasonal and creative cuisine with
more than 70% of the restaurant’s food supplied by local farmers.
Whereas, in 2013, Chef Howard and Ben Knight opened a second restaurant
in Kinston and aired the first season of their television show A Chef’s
Life on PBS. Whereas A Chef’s Life is a documentary that follows Chef
Howard and Ben Knight in their farm-to-fork restaurant and examines
their traditional and modern uses of classic southern ingredients.
Whereas, in 2014, A Chef’s Life was awarded a Peabody Award and named a
finalist for the James Beard Foundation Awards and whereas the success
of Chef Howard and Ben Knight has brought great honor to the state of
North Carolina. Now, therefore be it resolved throughout the House of
Representatives. Section I: the House of Representatives honors the
memory of George Foster Peabody and James Beard and expresses its
appreciation for their lasting legacies, which are recognized through
the Peabody Award and the James Beard Foundation Awards. Section II: the
House of Representatives congratulates Vivian Howard and Ben Knight on
being awarded a Peabody Award and for being named a finalist for the
2014 James Beard Foundation Awards. Section III: the principal clerk
shall transmit a certified copy of this resolution to Vivian Howard.</p>

and Ben Knight. Section IV: this resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the general assembly. Today we
honor the memories of George Foster Peabody and James Beard and express
appreciation for their contributions and their influence on American
culture. Their legacies live on through the Peabody Award, which is
known as the Pulitzer Prize of the broadcasting industry, and the James
Beard Foundation Award, which is given for excellence in food and
beverage industries. These awards inspire many but are rarely attained.
One of those inspired is our own Chef Vivian Howard from Deep Run, North
Carolina. Vivian and her husband, Ben Knight, opened Chef and the
Farmer, a high-end farm-to-fork restaurant in Kinston, North Carolina in
2006. Chef and the Farmer, which has grown in popularity, is the
background for the Peabody-Award-winning series A Chef’s Life which airs
on our PBS. What started as a restaurant and cooking show has now grown
to so much more. A Chef’s Life has helped make Eastern North Carolina a
dinner destination. The show is responsible for introducing Eastern
North Carolina to a national audience. The first season of A Chef’s Life
was broadcast in PBS markets covering 92% of the country and has been
viewed over 15 million times. This has had a direct impact on tourism
and the economy of the city of Kinston, Lenoir County and all of Eastern
North Carolina. On any given night, you can meet people from all over
the country that have come to Kinston just to eat at Chef and the
Farmer. A Chef’s Life showcases our rich agricultural heritage and the
farmers that make our community very special. Viewers can gather oysters
from Cedar Island, pick sweet potatoes at Tull Hill Farms, grab a drink
and a snack from Pleasant Hill Grocery and Gas or visit Warren Brothers
to find the best produce. Chef Vivian works with over 15 small farmers
in Eastern North Carolina to supply the restaurant with the proteins,
produce, dairy, nuts and grains that make the farm-to-fork concept a
reality. Mr. Speaker and members of this body, I ask that you join me in
commending this resolution honoring the memories of George Peabody and
James Beard and the successes of Vivian Howard, Ben Knight, Cynthia
Hill, and A Chef’s Life. May they continue exploring the South, one

Thank you Mr. Speaker and to my colleagues gathered here today I’d like
to extend a heartfelt welcome to those citizens that have travelled here
from Kinston and Lenoir County to be a part of this assembly today. I’d
like to say that we have total respect and appreciate what has happened
here with Ben and Vivian, in terms of what they’ve brought to Eastern
North Carolina. It’s not just a local restaurant, it is a national
restaurant and people from all over the United States and abroad come
and visit Kinston because of this fine facility. It was a old moose
stable, downtown in the heart of Kinston, and it was converted to this
fine, upbeat New-York-style restaurant. I want to say to you that the
food is extremely good, because I go there, but I want to say one other
thing if I may. We’ve created over seven million dollars of new
investments in the center part of town because of this restaurant and
what it is able to do. We’d like to say that the tax credits that kept
us in ?? we need to guarantee that they are there because they continue
to allow small communities, small counties, cities to develop by having
that particular credit available. Along with creating jobs, working with
the farmers on this crop and livestock, to have that purchased locally,
to prepare the food locally, to distribute the food, is just outstanding
and Mr. Chair I commend the resolution. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A little over a year ago, a young man by the
name of Representative John Bell came to visit me at my desk and said,
“Susi, you’re the lady that knows a little something about the film
industry in the state, aren’t you?” I said, “Yeah, what can I do for
you?” He said, “There’s a couple of people I want you to meet that are
filming a documentary right now about a farm-to-fork restaurant, but
they have more of a reality show kind of thing.” It was then that he
introduced me to Vivian and Ben, and they travelled to Wilmington and
had lunch with me and my daughter. We sat down and got to know each
other. It was an instant connection. Vivian’s vision for the restaurant
and for the show is really</p>

what North Carolina culture is all about. It’s about showing off to the
rest of the world what’s great about being a North Carolinian, a lot of
which has to do with food. What she added to the mix, she and Ben, was
the agricultural piece. From what I learned that day, Vivian grew up on
a hog farm, I believe, and Ben lived in a big city, a big city called
Chicago. They met in culinary school, worked together in big cities for
a few years before coming back to North Carolina to make their home and
I think it’s the perfect mix and the perfect recipe for success in a
town like Kinston to bring the agricultural heritage, the food culture
and the world of television to the community to grow its tourism, to
grow its economy. I think we can pretty much embrace Ben now as a North
Carolinian. We’re glad to have him here, we’re glad to have you both
here, and I commend the resolution to you.

and on behalf of all members, many of us who have enjoyed more than one
great meal in your restaurant, the Chair is happy to extend the
courtesies of the gallery to the following list of distinguished guests
in the gallery to the rear of the chamber: Vivian Howard; Ben Knight,
Vivian’s husband; Cynthia Hill, filmmaker; Amy Shumaker, executive

elected officials: Craig Hill, chairman of Lenoir County Commissioners;
Commissioner Mac Daughety; Commissioner Eric Rouse; and Commissioner
Linda Rouse Sutton. Please stand and welcome. Vivian, I have to admit my
only regret is that, when I heard you were going to bring some samples
for others who may not have been to your restaurant, that for some
reason we couldn’t get the pork belly pot stickers here. We have to see
those sooner or later but, ladies and gentlemen, if you’ve not been in
this restaurant it is extraordinary, it’s a great success story, it’s
something you can all be very proud of. It’s having a huge economic
impact in the Kinston and surrounding area. House Resolution 1265 the

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Maya Angelou was one of the most renowned and
influential voices of our times, hailed as a global renaissance woman. I
had the honor of meeting Dr. Angelou years ago and my last time with her
was in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In both settings, Dr. Angelou’s
words and actions stirred people’s souls, energized their bodies,
liberated their minds and healed their hearts. Today I want to share
excerpts from one of her well-known poems and two of her many quotes
that I especially love. Phenomenal woman.</p>

Pretty women wonder where my secret lies. I’m not cute or built to suit
a fashion model’s size. But when I start to tell them, they think I’m
telling lies. I say, it’s in the reach of my arms, the span of my hips,
the stride of my step, the curl of my lips. I’m a woman. Phenomenally,
phenomenal woman, that’s me. I walk into a room just as cool as you
please, and to a man, the fellows stand or fall down on their knees.
Then they swarm around me, a hive of honey bees. I say, it’s the fire in
my eyes, and the flash of my teeth, the swing in my waist, and the joy
in my feet. I’m a woman. Phenomenally, phenomenal woman, that’s me. My
first quote that I love from the Dr. Angela is each time a woman stands
up for herself without knowing it possibly, without climbing it she
stands up for all women. And my second quote is, “I have learned that
people will forget what you have said, people will forget what you did,
but people will never forget how you made them feel.” Dr. Angelou’s
words inspired enriched our culture and she always choose words to give
her audios and leaders piece and power, he ___[01:40] into some and

Thank you very much. Upon learning of Dr. Angelou’s death my breath was
temporarily taken away. I had indeed it had indeed been a quite since I
had actually seen her except on television. Naturally reflections about
how we met came to mind as these memories surfaced the thoughts of a
woman of courage, conviction, class, commitment and fairness to justice
and love for all people regardless of their position and status came to
my mind. If you share a space with her at anytime you would never forget
her nor her words. Maya herself was a phenomenal woman that’s why she
wrote so passionately about the ‘Phenomenal Woman’. God gave her so many
gifts and she shared them freely with the world. My fondest memory of
her always resonates through her graciousness, she made all people feel
better when they were with her and she knew they would never forget her
words and they didn’t. She was an author, poet, historian, song writer,
play write, dancer, stage and screen producer, director performer singer
and civil rights activist. She was well known for her books, a very
popular one I know ‘Why the Caged Bird Sings’ which was nominated for
the national book award. The first black woman Director in Hollywood,
Angelou wrote, produced, directed and starts in productions for state,
film and television. Dr. Angelou served on two presidential committees
was awarded the Presidential Medal of Arts in the year 2000. The Lincoln
Medal in the year 2008 and received three Grammy awards. President
Clinton requested that she compose a poem to read at his inauguration in
1993. Dr. Angelou reading of her poem on ‘The Pulse of The Morning’ was
broadcast around the world. Dr. Angelou has received over 15 honorary
degrees and was appointed Reynolds’s Professor of American Studies at
Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I actually met
her before she took that appointment. Her words and actions will
continue to stir our souls and energize our bodies, liberate our mind…

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can stand here and say wonderful things about Dr.
Angelou but her words speak better. And I’d like to recite one of the
poems that as a little black girl, helped me through many, and continues
to help me today, and it’s called Still I Rise. You may write me down in
history with your bitter twisted lies. You may trod me in the very dirt,
but still, like dust, I rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you
beset with gloom? ‘Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells pumping in my
living room. Just like moons and like the sun, with the certainty of
tides, just like hopes springing high, still I’ll rise. Did you want to
see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders following down
like teardrops, weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend
you? Don’t you take it awful hard ‘cause I laugh like I’ve got gold
mines diggin’ in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, you
may cut me with your eyes, you may kill me with your hatefulness, but
still, like air, I’ll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as
a surprise that I dance like I’ve got diamonds at the meeting of my
thighs? Out of the huts of history’s shame I rise up from a past that’s
rooted in pain I rise I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide, welling and
swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I
rise into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear I rise bringing the gifts
that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise
I rise I rise. I commend the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To

came to speak on the resolution and not to debate the resolution. If
you’ve lived as long as I have, you’ve had the privilege of meeting a
lot of people and knowing a lot of people. And in my lifetime, I’ve had
the privilege of meeting many, many people of note. People who have had
a great influence on my life. And one of them that I met during my
lifetime was Dr. Maya Angelou. It was my privilege to have been in her
company on many occasions and in fact to have visited in her home in
Winston Salem. And North Carolina should be proud to have, that she
chose our state to be our home. And on the occasions that I was in her
presence, I always left with the feeling that she, this great lady was a
tower of power, a rock of ages, because of the aura that surrounded her.
Maya Angelou wrote of the trials and tribulations of a black woman
growing up in the land of the free, shackled by the bonds of poverty and
racism, she knew that being black was not defined by the color of one’s
skin but by the condition of one’s mind. So early on in life, she
developed the mindset to succeed in spite of. So I guess the one way I
can really describe her and what I got from my short relationship with
her, can be developed by a play on the words of ?? She chose not to be a
common woman, because she conditioned her mind to be uncommon. She
sought opportunity, not security. She did</p>

not wished to be a kept citizen humbled and though, by having the state
look after her, she took the calculated risk, to dream and to build, to
fail and to succeed. She refused to barter in Senate for a dole. She
preferred the challenge of life  to the guaranteed existance, the thrill
of fulfillment to the stale calm of utopia. She did not trade freedom
for beneficence, nor her dignity for a handout. She never cowered before
any master, nor bent to any threat. She recognized that her heritage was
to stand erect, proud and unafraid to think and act for herself, enjoy
the benefit of her creations, and to face the world boldly and say
&quot;This, I have done.&quot; She was a teacher who taught us through
the written word that we as a race can overcome those barriers that have
been put upon us. How to take those things and turn them into
contributing factors. She taught us, both black and white, to understand
that in the beauty of diversity, that the only  melodies of beauty
coming from a piano are when you play the black keys and white keys
together.
She has made and is still making a great contribution to our way of
life. This tower of power, this rock of ages, has through her written
words, her experiences and not only a black woman, but as a woman, as a
human being, the mindset necessary to achieve. A mindset that would help
us all to a brighter, more fulfilling tomorrow. There is so much more
that I could say about this great lady, but she says everything so
eloquently in her words which I challenge all to at least read once or
twice. So as she passes on with the pantheon of others who passionately
wrote about life: Langston Hughes, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Richard Wright,
Chester Hines, Amiri Baraka, and those who have made significant
contributions to our society in spite of, I think it only fitting and
proper that her final benediction be taken from the words of Rev.
Pearly, upon the completion of the funeral services of the plantation
owner that was held in a small black church on the plantation. And those
who want to know a bit more about that, see me afterwards. But this I
think would be Maya Angelou's words to you as she travels that road to
Heaven. &quot;Today my friends, I find in being black a thing of beauty.
A joy, a secret cup of gladness, a native land that neither time nor
place, a native land in every black person's face. Be loyal to yourself,
your hair, your lips, your southern speech, your laughing kindness. A
black person's kingdom is as vast as any other. Accept in full the
sweetness of your blackness, not wishing to be white, nor red, nor
yellow, nor any other race or face but this. Farewell, my deep in
Africaning brothers and sisters, be brave. Keep freedom in the family.
Do what you can for the white folks and write me in care of the heavenly
post office. And now, may the Constitution of the United States go with
you, the Declaration of Independance stand by you, the Bill of Rights
protect you, and may your own dreams be your only boundaries, henceforth
now and forever. The song is at an end, but the melody lingers on.&quot;

Maya Angelou and I were introduced to Wake Forest University at about
the same time. She as the featured speaker at ?? auditorium, and I as a
freshman accountant in the finance department at Wake Forest medical
center. I think it appropriate that her memorial service was announced
as a celebration of her rising joy. For anyone who knew Dr. Angelou,
heard her speak or read any of her literacy works, they knew that she
was deep devout woman of faith. Dr. Ed Wilson, provost emeritus of Wake
Forest, was one of the many dignitaries who spoke at Dr. Angelou's
service. He eloquently described her as, &quot;an enormously gifted
woman who would be welcomed anywhere in the land ?? to this southern
university and make it her home. I think that because somehow  besides
honoring her we would love her and we wanted her as a companion. As her
colleague and fellow teacher, he would remember her as one who taught</p>

from her soul, and wanted to learn from the hearts of the students who
entrusted her. I personally recall how popular her classes were, they
always filled up quickly. Dr. Angelou was a renowned artist, professor,
and a master of words, and an ambassador for courage and truth. One of
my favorite sayins is on courage: &quot;Courage is the most important of
all virtues, because without courage, you cannot practice any other
virtue consistantly.  History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I've learned that no matter what happens or how bad it seems today, life
does go on and it will be better tomorrow. I've learned that you can
tell a lot about a person by the way he or she handles these three
things: A rainy day, lost luggage, entangled Christmas tree lights. I've
learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll
miss them when they're gone from your life, I've learned that making a
living is not the same thing as making a life. I've learned that life
sometimes gives you a second chance. I've learned that you shouldn't go
through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands, because you need to be
able to throw some things back. I've learned that whenever I decide with
an open heart, I usually make the right decision. I've learned even when
I have pains, I don't have to be a pain. I've learned that every day you
should reach out and touch someone, because people love a warm hug or
just a friendly pat on the back. And I've learned I still have a lot to
learn. These incredible life lessons are described in the words of a
remarkable gifted writer, renowned poet, activist, trail blazer,
activist teacher and mother, phenomenal Dr. Maya Angelou. Dr. Angelou
served to inspire generations over her lifetime, which spanned over 8
and a half decades. And what a blessing she's been and will continue to
be.
I had the pleasaure of meeting Dr. Angelou and being in her presence
many times, as she was a frequent visitor on the campus of Bennett
College, interacting in formal and informal settings with our students
and even serving on our board of trustees there. She was community
oriented and during her early years, she made appearances  in various
locations and events throughout the triad area. And I always made my way
to wherever she was to hear her powerful poetic messages, always in awe
and I was always inspired and mesmerized by her presence. And on May
28th, our state and our nation and this world lost an incredible
humanitarian. A skillful writer and extraordinary orator, whose poetry
spanned our journey, chronicled our hearts, and documented our struggles
as we move from the orations of Martin Luther King Jr., to the
presidency of Barack Obama. It was an extraordinary honor for me to
attend her funeral several weeks ago and to witness the celebration of
her amazing life with musical and historical legends. Dr. Angelou was
indeed a phenomenal woman, she was a role model, she was a
&quot;shero&quot; and an arousing spirit who loved who she was, and she
taught others, especially African-American women and young girls to
embrace themselves and to acknowledge their greatness. She was rooted in
culture and grounded in the goodness of the Earth. Dr. Angelou was so
vividly articulated, this love and her sense of pride in her amazing
famous poetic renditions, a phenomenal woman as you've heard already.
This writing was among thousands, including her best known book I Know
Why The Caged Bird Sings. They demonstrated her talent for weaving words
into songs and songs into melodies. She was versatile, she was focused,
she was fixated on humanity and helping to bring love and kindness into
this world, and indeed she did that. And like every great artist, she
emerged from deep and sorrowful struggle to reveal a beautiful,
confident, calm and wise soul. And she used that struggle to transform
herself, and she made us believe</p>

And we too could transform ourselves. So I truly thank God today for the
life of this remarkable woman, Dr. Maya Angelou, who was indeed
phenomenal. Who’s phenomenal in her strength and creative genius, woke
up this nation and caused us to take a good look at ourselves and how we
should treat one another, reminding us of the quote that you’ve already
heard. That people will forget what you said. People will forget what
you did. But people will never forget how you made them feel. Mr.
Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of this House, I’m pleased to support this
resolution and I commend it to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Mobley, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on
the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I won’t be long. But I just did not
realize that this woman, as great as she is, and how I learned from her,
until I started to listen to some of the things that were said about her
during her passing. I have a habit of stopping people sometimes when
they call me by my first name and they really don’t know me. And I found
out during the week of her passing, that she did that. She would stop
them and say, no I’m not Maya, I’m Dr. Angelou. So when I stop people
from calling me by my first name, my defense of that is saying, you
don’t know me so how do you feel you can call me Annie? But I think
that’s just the times that we’re living in. I think she was a phenomenal
woman, and she has taught me to be just that as well. And I’m going to
close with this quote from her. Life is not measured by the number of
breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer-Butterfield, please state

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Senate Amendment #1 I happen to agree with,
but I want to thank Representative Horn and Brody for allowing me to
speak on this. Without airing the dirty laundry in my community I will
say that I agree with the Senate amendment but, because the House is not
acceptable of that amendment, I would ask that you vote with
Representative Horn’s recommendation not to concur so that I can
possibly work out a solution that would satisfy this House. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion? The question before
the House is the motion by Representative Horn to not concur in Senate
Amendment #1 for House Bill 1212. All in favor vote aye, all opposed
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine
record the vote, 116 having voted affirmative and none in the negative.
The House has supported the motion to not concur in the Senate Amendment
#1 for House Bill 1218. Representative Horn and Representative Johnson,
if possible, I would like to get conferees as quick as possible so we
can get to work on the conference report, and by as quickly as possible
I mean over the next 10 or 15 minutes. House Bill 1247 the clerk will
read.</p>

be an act to require North Carolina courts to commission the study, same
thing we were talking about last week, requiring cities and counties to
remove personal information from their websites. The same rules are
still applying. We’re still looking at things. One of the points that I
wanted to make that some of the people have been talking about was city
and county websites from which nonelected officials may request removal
of their personal information, some people wanted to know whether or not
that might include the Register of Deeds or whether or not we should
take it out. That’s something that we’re going to look at. Thank you.

thank Representative Malone for going this way. The bill he wants to do
is an incredibly good thing to try and help out law enforcement
officers; however it creates a lot of unintended consequences and I’d
like those people on the Courts Commission to take a look at it to
figure out all those unintended consequences and if there are ways to
avoid them, and I will tell you that as Chair of the Courts Commission,
I promised that we would hear it at our first meeting, so I’d ask for

Members, this is the first day of my last month on this floor and
because that can be trying, I wrote out some of my comments but I
thought I’d keep them kind of short. I wanted to talk about the things
on my desk, because all of us have things on our desk that mean
something to us, and when we take the time to ask people we’re often
curious to see them. So one of the first things that will always be on
my desk is a box of tissue, because it’s so you-know-what cold in here,
that my nose is always running.</p>

<p id="090:00">
And that is one of the few things that I will not miss around here. The
second is I have this license plate from the Catawba Lands Conservancy
and the Carolina Thread Trail. As Representative Carney will know, we’ve
worked on this for as long as I’ve been in politics, and it’s the one
project that in my entire time in politics I know I will love until the
day I die. It is also symbolic of my love for the environment, which is
based on what I believe is the Lord’s commandment that the environment
is a gift to us and we are to use it but not abuse it, and every time I
look at this, it would remind me of that. This you heard about when we
had the NASCAR Hall of Fame. This is my season pass to the NASCAR Hall
of Fame. I love the science of NASCAR, but unexpected to me, last week
it became the tool to the answer to a longtime dream of mine to be
invited to the White House, and I wasn’t here last week because Pricey
Harrison was kind enough to get my name on a list to honor Jimmy
Johnston, who was one of my constituents, and I got to go to the White
House because of NASCAR. My mother will be astounded. The other thing
here is a Valentine’s Day present from my grandchild on his first
Valentine’s, and I’m looking real forward to spending a lot more time
with my family, but it also makes me think… Some of you know that this
child was not a planned child and that it involved many protocol issues
with various family members, and I know that many of you have the same
issues with your family, and when we’re here we’re so business-related,
we don’t often think about our families, and so I wanted to encourage
all of you to care for one another when I am gone. In here is… I used to
call it mind candy because everybody else has candy, but it’s versus
from scripture, it’s quotes from famous people, and I have them there to
always remind me how valuable and important it is for us to learn from
the people who go before us and to particularly learn from the word of
God, which has been my lifeblood. Under my glass here I have a seating
chart, and the seating chart, every time I look at it it reminds me of
my favorite time every day when we’re in session, and that’s to be here,
because it’s the easiest way to connect with everybody and when needed
to go about and encourage or equip us to do the work that we have been
called to do. Under my computer I have a map of the state of North
Carolina. It used to be accurate on districts; it’s not anymore, but it
is accurate on counties, and it helps me realize as a native North
Carolinian how wonderful our state is and the role that each of you play
in making that state wonderful, and it also sometimes reminds me of my
first session here when I realized I’d never been t the Outer Banks –
there were lots of parts of the state I’d never been to – and went and
took a tour, and I wanted to thank Representative Daughtry for taking me
to my first ever hog farm, and what an impact that made on me to be able
to see a hog farm and to experience parts of the state that I had not
been to. But the deepest… I shouldn’t have looked at him – and the most
personal pieces of my desk have always been these hymns that I keep
under here because when things get really testy, sometimes I’ll look at
these hymns and I’ll read through them and just sort of quote them to
myself and remind myself that there is life outside of politics, and so
I wanted to close with these first and last verse of my favorite hymn –
at least my favorite in the glass. Hold on a second. This doesn’t count
toward my time. In Christ alone my hope is found. He is my light, my
strength, my song. This cornerstone, this solid ground firm, through the
fierce, fiercest drought and storm. What heights of love, what depths of
peace when fears are stilled, when strivings cease. My comforter, my all
and all. Here in the love of Christ I stand, no guilt in life, no fear
in death. This is the power of Christ in me. From life’s first cry to
final breath, Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell, no scheme of
man can ever pluck me from his hand. ‘Til he returns or calls me home,
here in the power of Christ I’ll stand. I’ll love and miss you all, but
I’m looking forward to my second half.</p>
