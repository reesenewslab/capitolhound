[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President Motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has a floor for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President this motion is relating to Senate Bill 3, Mr. President we
are in budget process with the house process we go through every year
instead of hammering out of budget the house is over Senate Bill 3 for
concurrence. There are number of problems with this latest political
___[01:28], the biggest problem is the bill violates the balanced budget
requirement in our constitution in our State Budget Act. We are under
duty to have a balance budget. Senate Bill 3 spends a lot of money but
it doesn’t account for all of the debts that out there, you can look
right at the bill and see that. A non partisan fiscal staff has
___[01:52] us that there are range of unfunded debts dealing with
funding medicate over the next year. I ask they pass out of hand that as
I continue. Senate Bill 3 ignores this range and all is to figure follow
odds with our fiscal staff. If we ignore staff’s testaments we are
setting the state for a gapping budget hole next year. We aren’t allowed
to do that under the constitution or the State Budget Act, I hereby move
the Senate Bill 3 to be sent back to the House of Representatives for
further consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection so ordered. Senate Bill 3 will be returned to the house.
