Now we're back on the bill, is there any comment from the members?
Representative Harris?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have
a, was an original sponsor to the House companion to Senate Bill 3 ,
ours was a little bit more of an ambitious standard, but never-the-less,
I participated in many of those 90-plus member stakeholder meetings
where we got concessions from the industry, and from consumers, and from
environmental advocates and others who were concerned about the state of
our energy policy in North Carolina. We had contracted a study with La
Capra back in 2007, that anticipated making a significant amount of
clean energy jobs in North Carolina, it projected to have the energy
rates reduced by a significant amount for rate payers as of 2021, it
also indicated we'd be creating a clean energy economy, and creating
energy security for our state. I think that the La Capra study has come
to bear and we know that on recent reports that we've seen that we've
got about $3.7 billion in North Carolina's economy in clean energy
investments and revenues, 1100 clean energy businesses, 21,000 clean
energy jobs in North Carolina, at a time when our economy wasn't in very
good shape, and we've seen also a commensurate decrease in energy rates
if you look at the analyses that have been performed on rates that have
actually been impacted by the renewable energy standard, have been
pretty much stagnant, so it has not resulted in the rate increases that
have been claimed. I think it's a terrible signal to business to have
this policy in place, to entice these businesses to locate here, create
this energy economy which, we're the number two state in the country for
clean energy job growth, and we've become a clean energy manufacturing
hub here in North Carolina, so it seems crazy to just throw that all
out. I know personally a large foundation that's interested in investing
in swine waste energy, but has held off as a result of all the
uncertainty about the potential for refilling our clean energy
standards, so I just think there's so many reasons that this is bad
policy, whether it's our economy or whether it's energy security, or for
the rate-payer, or for clean air, I think there's all kinds of reasons
that we ought to be concerned about this legislation, and I urge you to
vote no.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar...sorry, Representative
Hager, then we'll get Representative Dollar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I've seen the same numbers that Representative Harris
said, but I want to address one issue real quick, and this has been just
a misconception as we've gone on through this, Representative Harris
counted 21,000 jobs, and if you look at the La Capre report, it's not
21,000 job-years. The last time job-years were used was with the
stimulus package and how many job years. As you guys know, one job
created for four years is four job-years, so if you do the math, it's
about 3500 jobs total, 3500-4000 jobs. And I find it funny that this is
a clean energy bill, but you'll allow swine waste and poultry waste to
be burned. And I find it funny that it's a clean energy bill, but you
don't allow all the hydro to be used, which is one of the best renewable
sources we have. So you've got to look beyond that and say, what kind of
a bill was this, this is a bill in which a sector of business was born
on the backs of the consumers, on the backs of State government, and the
backs of the rate-payers. Why else would you have to have federal tax
credits, state tax credits, and renewable energy credits in order to
regulate your portfolio for your business to survive? If the business
doesn't need these, and if it is cheaper than what we have now, then why
do we need tax credits, why do we need subsidies, why do we need
mandates? That's the question you have to ask yourself. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman, and I will apologize to the sponsors in advance, I've
only recently had the time to sit down and take a look at the bill, and
of course I appreciate having the PCS, and got a chance to look at it.
My question is directed toward Duke Energy, as Duke is now the
consolidated, primary provider of power in North Carolina, and I would
like to hear, Mr. Chairman, if Duke Energy is here, a representative, I
would like to pose a question to them.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anyone
here from Duke Energy? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you would, come forward and
state your name and who your with, for the record, and Representative
Dollar, we'll let you ask your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, my name is Kelly Cocurra, I'm with Duke
Energy, three months and one week. Happy to answer any questions I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, if you...[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Miss Cocurra, could you...</p>

<p id="05:00">
Tell us what analysis has been done by Duke Energy on the impact of this
bill and to the extent that you all are making an assessment or have or
haven't made an assessment on the PCS that's been offered. The impact of
this bill with regard to rates, to power production, to availability, to
the energy market here in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] yeah, I'll be happy to share our perspective on that
representative Dollar. Some of you were here in 2007 and know that
senate bill three was a very carefully crafted consensus bill and while
Duke Energy did not specifically request modifications to senate bill
three our goal with house bill 298 would be and is to once again work
with representative Hager and the other sponsors of the bill and
interested stakeholders to find consensus. We have ran a number of
models, just read the PCS a few moments ago so our experts will need to
go back and take another look to be able to specifically answer your
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What was your analysis of the prior bill before the
PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ability to recover - our concern just to back up a
moment is our ability to recover for our contracts and based on this
most recent PCS the ability  to recover for our contracts appears to
remain intact with this current PCS but again I would want someone with
more experience than I have at this stage to take a look at that to be
able to give us a better answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman if I could just ask one more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Representative Dollar, another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I won't belabor the point but what's the impact?
What's Duke Energy's assessment of the impact of 298 on residential
consumers and others?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In terms of financials or? I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Financial and otherwise if you...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have the specific statistics or data on that
based on the PCS today but I will be more than happy to provide that to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. If I could I'd like to make a
comment and then ask a question followed by as many follow ups as you
would graciously allow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well we have 15 minutes and I have Whitmire is the
only other member that I have that wants to speak, and Alexander. Are
there any other...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Whitmire's pretty quick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me just check, a real quick check and see who all
wants to speak. Alexander did you want to speak? Leubke, is there any
others? Okay, we should have time for all that. Feel free representative
Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. My concern with 298 is it
seems like to me that we're talking about trying to end the subsidy in
an industry that is by definition subsidized. They have monopolies on
where they exist. In my neighborhood I don't have an option of energy
choice, I must use Energy United or I don't get electricity.That is a
subsidy one way or the other. It may not be a financial subsidy but is a
guaranteed monopoly. This bill doesn't change that fact. I'm also
concerned that this bill doesn't affect third party sales in removing
quips [??]. If we're going to go free market let's do it. To me we're
splitting the baby in half, and my concern is we're allowing - and I
don't want to single out Duke Energy, but we're allowing the electricity
companies to have the benefit of senate bill three form 2007 and taking
away the parts that aren't as beneficial maybe perhaps to them. My
question if I could to the bill's sponsor is I've heard that this will
reduce energy costs but yet when I got my bill from progress, Duke
Progress Energy, I don't know, whatever their new name is, at my
apartment literally yesterday, it had a sub-line item. So it's my
understanding that this current legislation - I guess my question is,
and I don't know the answer to this, I really don't know the answer. My
understanding is the reps comes out at a separate...</p>

...line item which costs me, on my current bill, 43 cents per bill, per
month, and it doesn't have a direct impact on my actual electric rate.
Am I incorrect in that assessment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Hager. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First let me address
the comment in talking about a free market and subsidies within North
Carolina for a Duke Power partner/synergy, whatever. As you may or may
not know, Representative Jeter, Duke has what's called a responsibility
to serve. That may not mean much in your area, living around Lake
Norman, but it means much to everybody in the center rural area. For
instance, I live 3/4 mile off the road, they have to serve me, they
don't make any money off of me, they have to serve me. And there's this
thing called the transmission system that they have to keep up, there's
this thing called the grid that they have to keep up, they have to...you
like your refrigerator run so it at the right voltage, they have to
maintain that, you like your t.v. to run, so it has to be the right
frequency, they have to maintain that. There's more than just what you
see as far as the generation side of Duke Power. They have a
transmission side, they have a distribution side, they have a grid
parity side also. So it's all that rolled in together, so if you want to
unroll that, you've got to unroll the whole bill. You can't just say,
&quot;well, you can't have the part that makes money, but you've got to
have the part that maintains responsibility to serve.&quot; I think
that's a whole separate conversation but I do appreciate your comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's OK. And to answer
the question about the bill, it was very clever the way the bill was
crafted, I look at it and as you may or may not know, there's three
types of rates in North Carolina, there's Residential, there's
Industrial, and there's Commercial. And you look at the numbers and you
find that yes, it was true that you're paying a little bit on the
Residential side, but you've got to look at the Commercial side, you've
got to look at the Industrial side, and I'll tell you, those two things
actually drive the economy and drive inflation, more than what you pay
on your Residential bill. And as a good example, I think on the
Commercial, on the Industrial side, the maximum charge is $1000 per
month. It's, I think it's a couple hundred dollars right now, $200-$300
dollars right now, which is different than the 42 cents that you see on
your bill. The Commercial is in the $30-$50 charge, somewhere around
there. So you may see that come down, and it comes down, I think,
proportionately, in the Industrial and the Commercial side too, in the
cents-wise, it comes down 10 cents on your bill, it probably comes down
10 cents on the other bill. So you see the more egregious side, you
don't see the more egregious side, which is actually as costs, through
our small businesses, and through our manufacturers that we are trying
to attract. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, since I have three
others in the queue, I'm going to let them speak, and if we have time, I
will come back to you. We have public comment from 12:30 to 12:45, and
we're voting at 12:45, but if time allows, I will come back to you and
let you ask the others. Representative Whitmire. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chair. I have a three-part question, I'll direct it at the bill
sponsor, but quite possibly, if it needs to be deferred, I'll leave that
up to you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, if you could be
all summed up in one question, it'd be great, because I do have two
others, and we have ten minutes here.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. All right,
first of all I commend the intent here, to try to get current capability
and reasonable aspirations of increased renewables to a realistic level.
When we look at the cost per kilowatt of wind and solar, and we look at
that compared to conventional, plus the amount of subsidy it takes to
create these, I would love to know the numbers, and, you know, the
western part of the state has a lot of hydro production, but yet,
nothing exceeding 10 megawatts with this amendment, which is now part of
the bill, is allowed. Someone please quantify how small a lake or flow
has to be not to exceed 10 megawatts? Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] You want that in gallons? To
not exceed 10, Lake Lure, for example, is a smaller generator, and it
actually fits under this bill, but if you know Lake Lure is about
700-and-some miles of shoreline. Pretty good-sized lake. Really doesn't
determine the size of the lake, it determines the size of the hydro in
there. A lot of the small mountain lakes, like up there in Franklin  and
that area would qualify, and be under that 10 megawatts, around your
area.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Alexander. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just simply wanted to make an observation
that, as a student of history, I've noticed that if you want to grow a
market, if you want to engender new technology, then at some point,
those activities have been subsidized. I remember the 16th president,
one Abraham Lincoln, who worked for the railroads, and during his first
term, encouraged Congress to subsidize the development of,,,</p>

said, railroads as they came across the great continent through the use
of essentially the eminent domain powers of the federal government in
order to give land to those private companies that they were able to
then turn around and sell and develop. We talk about hydroelectric. The
TVA is an excellent example of a government subsidy to help create and
generate electricity. I could go on and on, but I say this to you to say
that Senate Bill 3 was not onerous. It was not anything new and it is
helping to put North Carolina at the cutting edge. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
have Representative Luebke and then Representative Samuelson and then
we're going to move to public comment. Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this is a question, well, it
is a question for staff. Miss Fennel I think would be the one. I'm
trying, as a former finance chair I'm interested in what has happened to
the tax credits here and what I mean by that is as you remember we
enacted some tax credits that related to renewable energy in separate
bills, bills separate from Senate Bill 3, so my question is whether in
this House Bill 298, which is seen as an update and change of Senate
Bill 3, whether also all the tax credits are repealed that we had put in
at different times and often as separate bills, sometimes as part of the
finance package, etc. So can you tell me about the tax credits. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. I will say there was one tax
credit enacted in Senate Bill 3 and this bill does not touch that tax
credit, and that was a tax credit for donation to a non-profit for that
non-profit to invest in renewable energy property. So that is not
touched by this bill. I believe you're referring to the Business and
Energy Tax Credits, for example the tax credit for investing in
renewable energy property. That tax credit is set to expire in 2016.
That is not affected by this bill and it has not been changed. I'm not
sure what other information you're looking for but these don't change
those. A lot of those are expiring very shortly anyway because of some
other reform efforts here at the General Assembly. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a quick follow up, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So basically what you're saying is that bill that you
just described, this energy tax credit, it has a sunset on it as we
typically did in finance at that time, and it's because of the sunset,
really, independent of this legislation, that that will be expiring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee. It's no secret that I don't support
this bill and made some comments last time and I won't remake those.
I've actually got a question and if there's somebody here from the
utilities commission, because my understanding was not only did the
original bill have cost from the renewable side, but cost from all the
parts of the bill that we're not talking that are currently reflected on
your bill, but I was under the impression that even that obligation to
serve to the degree that it cost the utility something that they were
able to recoup the cost and I think even to make that that's part of the
equation in a rate case on their earning profits. So if there's somebody
from the utilities in here, I thought that did, was something that they,
I hate to say make money on it, but part of the equation of allowing a
regulated monopolistic utility to have a profit is that that's factored
into it as well. Is there somebody here? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there
some? If you would just state your name and who you're with for the
record please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dan Conner, and I'm a staff attorney
with the Utilities Commission. If your question is whether or not they
can recoup their investment, investment in public utility that invests
in a solar or wind project would be able to pass their costs if that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Clarify my question. No, actually I was talking about
the answer that this bill sponsor gave on the fact that with the
obligation to serve that there are certain costs that I think the
statement was, and I wasn't writing it down to get it quoted, but that
when the utility has these costs to provide service that that costs them
and that they don't make anything on it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There will
certainly pass through when they open up a general rate case they can
put in costs. That would be required, too, when they have to provide
some</p>

-to an individual or residence. If they incur costs, those would be able
to be passed through into the general rate base.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman and representatives, that's not what I said. I was telling
Representative Jeter there was more than just producing power into what
Duke has to do. Manage the grid, have the responsibility to serve
everybody where other folks don't have those issues if you just compare
apples to apples. It's not apples-apples comparison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I got the answer I needed which was that cost is part of the
right case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That completes the committee remarks and we will now move to the public
comments and I have four people who have signed up to speak, I'm just
going to call them in order. I have them here on the sheet. John
Morrison, you're first, and if you will, try to limit your comments to
two minutes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you very much. I'm John
Morrison, I'm the chief operating officer of Strata Solar. Strata Solar
is a solar development and builder of solar farms here in North
Carolina. We're the largest solar company in North Carolina, the fourth
largest in the nation. Today I brought with me- well, let me back up.
First of all, we build solar farms that are typically thirty-three acres
in size. We sell electricity from those farms to utilities to do
progress, co-ops, ??. Today I brought with me a bottle of Texas Pete.
For those of you who were at the House Committee hearings a couple of
weeks ago, remember that the sponsor of this bill brought forward a
bottle of Texas Pete and explained a scenario whereby these premiums
that are paid for renewable energy ripple through our economy and create
additional costs to the ratepayers of North Carolina. If that's the
case, I would like to have some, please. We do not receive additional
payments from the utilities or the rate payers for the electricity that
we sell to them. We sell at avoided costs. That's utility-speak for the
marginal cost of the utility. That's a rate set by the Utilities
Commission and it represents the cost that Duke or any other utility
produced the next incremental kilowatt hour of energy. The rate is set
by the commission so that the utility is financially indifferent between
buying electricity from us or generating it themselves. Now, when Senate
Bill 3 was passed, there was a premium for energy, and this was the
genius of the legislators who created that bill, because they created a
market mechanism that relied on competitive forces, and when the bill
was first passed, the supply of renewable energy was very limited. The
cost of renewable energy was about three times the avoided cost.
Entrepreneurs, businesses like Strata Solar, jumped into that
opportunity and have dramatically increased the supply of renewable
energy, so much so that that premium is essentially zero at this point,
and so to the point of rate payers or paying a premium for renewable
energy, it simply is not true. The rapid decline that's occurred as
companies like ours have come in have taken a number of people by
surprise. The utilities included-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Morrison, if you could be wrapping your comments up. Your two
minutes is up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I would close by saying that the objectives of this
bill will not be realized because there is not an impact to the rate
payers of North Carolina from renewable energy that we are now building,
and at the same time the economic opportunities and benefits that occur
from the construction of those farms and the operation of those farms to
tax base to land owners and to individuals earning income, payroll from
those jobs would be beneficial. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Next up I have Kent, and I apologize, I'm not going to try to
pronounce your last name, so I'll let you come forward and I'll let you
do that. If you could just state your name and who you're with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Kent ??, director of ?? Academies, but lifelong engineer. Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, I've spent much of my engineering career
working on energy-related projects, including nuclear, hydrocoil, coal,
oil, gas, and renewables in the US, Europe, and Asia. The following
three examples from Europe describes what happens when governments
attempt to make what should be unregulated, free market decisions.
Example one: wind energy. A senior manager for Denmark's
&quot;Vestas&quot;, the world's largest wind turbine maker, reported to
me in 2010 that the company was downsizing as a result of reductions in
government subsidies. Clearly it's an unsustainable industry. Bloomberg
News reported last week that Vestas had lost its second CFO in the past
eighteen months due to continued financial losses. Example two: solar
energy. Despite major government support, the German newspaper &quot;Die
Welt&quot; just reported that the German solar industry is dissolving,
with one third of the country's solar related business just having
closed in the past year-</p>

house bill two-ninety-eight and will not support any changes to the
writs in any form we believe in all renewable projects should ultimately
be self-sufficient but it must be understood that certain initial market
risks that's associated with the development of renewable energy
projects accounting for these risks and without financial encouragement
of the as written legislation this state will create a business impasse
in the investment of the cost effective self-sustained renewable
projects ?? Energy which is a subsidiary of Prestage Farm is currently
in final negotiations for a poultry litter gassification facility in
Bladen County Prestage certainly see its large waste of energy project
halted without the support of senate bill three as it's currently
written basing the  established mandate Prestage has already invested
millions to help fulfill the utility company needs and our project is a
cost effective repairs in North Carolina and provide financial stability
to two of the largest employers in this state we will also lose the

we would invest annually in the economically depressed areas that we
serve a certain long time markets are establish projects similar to what
Prestage is already pursuing could be develop with little or no

of an house sort of shotty set-up in the first place we really need a
better energy policy in North Carolina the RPS mandate of two
thousand-seven has failed to meet the stated purpose that was put forth
to begin with it worsens consumers needs with higher prices general
assembly business winners and losers make questionable environmental
decisions if the purpose of the RPS was to benefit energy consumers why
haven't rate payers seen any tangible benefit rate payers in the state
had additional cost energy bill rammed down their throats people who are
against this bill talk over and over how consensus people bought to the
table for estate holders but the ?? holders are the rate payers of the
energy themselves people who are in support of keeping the writ in place
are people who have direct financial incentive to keep it in place it's
ridiculous</p>

Yes, you know.  Yes we now have a substantial solar energy in North
Carolina but it wouldn't have been that if the RPS in general wouldn't
have guaranteed them 1/8 of the market of the energy market in North
Carolina by 2020 in the first place.  It's ridiculous that the general
assembly was ever supposed to pick winners and losers.  Since 2005
families with household incomes in North Carolina between $30,000 and
$50,000 have seen their energy rates increase by 20%, not 20%, but 20%
of their income used to pay for energy.  That's not insignificant for
low income households.  Energy  consumers in RPS states can bet on
gradual increases for utility prices and taxes.  The expected result of
government intervention, the non, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? if you could be rapping it up please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The non-partisan state that the research.  Yes sir.
Found that states with some form of RPS on average have 39% higher
energy costs.  I urge you to do the right thing and vote in favor of
House Bill 298.  The bill will cap, roll back and sunset the RPS and
greatly benefit the North Carolina rate payers, your taxpayers, your
constituents.  These rate payers will not consider with the passage of
the Senate Bill 3 and 2007.  I urge you to think of them now and be a
leader in this nation.  Other states are watching you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager we will recognize you for closing
remarks and then we'll accept a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Now what we're talking about
here guys is very simple.  I think this bill is to a point now to where
if you oppose this bill you oppose a mandate that allows, I mean you
support a mandate and subsidy that will virtually last forever.  You
have to decide yourself do you want your kids, your grandkids, your
great grandkids paying for a subsidy that will last forever.  If you do
then this is the bill for you.  If you think that subsidizing a sector
of business for the next year pick your number 25, 50, 100, 200 years is
ok, then this is the bill for you.  I think we got to end the subsidy.
I think we have a fair bill here that soft lands the industry.  Mr.
Morrison was at the, spoke first, but he's told me himself that by,
potentially they probably won't need the tax credit when it expires,
it's fine.  Reps will be, if they go for too long it'll be fine and
they'll be in strata solar which has a good business plan, will be fine
as these things go away.  So I like it a lot to a bear at Yellowstone.
You know there are signs there if any of you have been there that says,
what does it say? Don't feed the bears.  You know there's probably two
reasons.  One,  you might get your hand bit off.  Second is, if you feed
those bears they don't know how to go look for food anywhere else.  I'll
leave you guys with that visual.  Another thing to think about if the
only way this sector of business can move forward and the only way that
investors want will come here is to make sure we have subsidies and tax
credits, I think we need to rethink the business.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There are two members hands that went up we actually
are public are committee remarks are from 12 to 12:30.  We have four
minutes left before we're gonna vote.  I will quickly allow you to ask a
question or make a comment if that's what they need to do,
Representative Luebke and Hamilton, and then we're gonna vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Actually I would have a
question, but I respect what you're saying about wanting to vote at
12:45.  I will say that Representative Lucas said he needed to get
something to eat and oh is he back.  Alright well thank you.  I didn't
see him and I'll pass on my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton and then we'll be ready for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I'll be brief.  You know, I'm
just compelled after listening to all this discussion to mention the
fact that the Federal Government in the United States of America for the
last 40 or so years has in fact subsudized and given credits and grants
and what not for reasearch and development for the oil and gas industry.
 So I'll ask a question and it's rhetorical and I don't expect an
answer.  If we're gonna go after subsidies, credits, grants, whatever
you want to call them for renewable sources of energy, perhaps we should
start a campaign to go after research and development dollars for the
oil and gas insdustry.  Now I don't believe we should do either of those
things.  I think it's moved this country forward in our domestic energy
policy by providing government support for research and development and
oil and gas just like we've done in the state of North Carolina by
providing research and development and financial support for the
renewable energy sources which have made us a leader in the nation.  I
encourage you strongly to vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins we'll allow you to make a
remark and then we'll take a vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that question Representative Hamilton.
We hear that a lot that all sources of energy are getting subsidized and
maybe I should have printed this up for you, but this shows Federal
subsidies of electricity sources per mega watt hour and if you notice
there's one line there that's real high and another one you can just
barely see and the rest of them are basically flat.  That one line
that's really really high is solar at almost $800 per mega watt hour.
The one you can see is wind at about 50 and natural gas and coal and oil</p>

-are so small that they won't even show up at less than ten dollars per
megawatt hour.  So there's a huge different in the way these sources of
energy are subsidized.
