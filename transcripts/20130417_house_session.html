The House will come to order. Members please take your seats, visitors
please retire from the chamber. Members and visitors of the gallery,
please silence all cellular phones and personal electronic devices. The
prayer will be offered by Representative Ken Goodman. Members and
visitors of the gallery, please stand and please remain standing for the
Pledge of Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is probably no saint more revered and well known in all of
Christian history than Saint Francis of Assisi. Today, Christians and
many non-Christians alike celebrate the life and legacy of this medieval
Italian man who is known the world over for his exemplary life of
holiness and model of peaceful living he leaves to us nearly 800 years
after his death. There is also probably no Christian prayer more
popular, with the exception of the Lord’s Prayer, than the one that
bears the name of this saint from Assisi. The Prayer of Saint Francis:
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me
sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith.
Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where
there is sadness, joy. Oh Divine Master, grant that I may not so much
seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to
be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive. It is in
pardoning that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born to
eternal life. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to
the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

Information about healthy pregnancies and birth defects. Resources such
as Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby, and a smartphone application that includes
health information and a journal is available. Colleagues, when I was
just a young lad, my mom was one of the moms that marched with the March
of Dimes from house to house, taking up dimes. And I went with her, and
I really enjoyed that job because I got to count the dimes. I’ve been
fortunate enough as an adult to be on the board of the March of Dimes, a
wonderful organization. And this is a very important year for them. I
ask for your support in joining me in recognizing the March of Dimes
with this resolution, for their 75th anniversary. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gill, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady
is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very
much. I belong to a sorority called Zeta Phi Beta Sorority,
Incorporated. And we have partnered with the March of Dimes for the past
50 years, to help promote pre-term, I mean to reduce pre-term births,
through their prematurity campaign. And our project is called Healthy
Babies, and every year we have throughout North Carolina, Bowling for
Healthy Babies to raise money for March of Dimes. So I commend this
resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, when I shared with
you about one of my grandmothers when we honored the grams, and I have
another grandmother that was afflicted with polio. And I only knew her
as a bedridden woman with crippled legs. But what an amazing woman. But
I also was one of those elementary school students who had my little
book and collected the dimes and turned them in and was excited the year
I was asked to chair for my class, collect all the books and go count
them in the principal’s office. But I want to share with you what the
March of Dimes has done with infant screening. They were the pioneer in
our newborn screenings. I want to share with you, we voted in this
chamber on a bill and all of you to me are pioneers in this effort of
newborn screening for our ?? bill. And Representative Fulghum was the
lead on that, Representative Murray was one of the sponsors. But we too
are pioneering in that field of heart screening for newborns, so I
commend the March of Dimes for all that it has done for our newborns and
for our youth and I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was one of those children
that y’all went out and collected dimes for. I was born with a cleft lip
and palate, and have had 30 operations, which makes me question the
ability of modern medicine if this is the best they can do after 30
surgeries. [LAUGHTER] It’s not funny. [LAUGH] But you know, it’s
interesting. I’ve had 30 operations and when I was born in 1973, there
was a, the March of Dimes was influential to my family in helping us pay
for some surgeries. There was a big argument of at that time whether or
not you fixed cleft lip and palate with a prosthetic or what was called
a phalangeal flap. At that point, the common practice was the
prosthetic, which led to speech problems and March of Dimes and my mom
got together and decided that they didn’t want me to have a problem
talking. So I apologize about that too. [CHUCKLE] But without the March
of Dimes, my life would have been dramatically different. Without the
people that Representative Lambeth, Carney and Gill referenced that have
walked and collected those dimes, my life would have been different.
There’s been no resolution or bill that’s had more of an impact on
what’s had an impact on me, than what we’re about to vote on today and I
strongly commend the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Graham, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, I’m

judgement exceeds the deposit by 25% or more. General Saine of North
Carolina, Indianapolis.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Jackson, please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this bill is gonna attempt to
address what many of us who have practiced in this area of law believe
is DOT's current practice of not depositing just compensation when they
condemn property. In 2012 in fact, every jury verdict throughout the
whole state exceeded by more than 25% of DOT's deposit. With an average
jury verdict of an additiona. 637%. This bill, and there is a fiscal
note and I'm reading from that because the summary has been updated
since yesterday's committee reading. Section one of the bill requires
interest on DOT condemnation award be paid from the date of taking to
the date the judgement is paid. That's currently how every other debter,
judgement debter is treated ?? the interest is figured until the court
house receives the check and the clerk has deposited the funds.
Currently DOT is treated a little bit different, and so if they delay
30, 60, 90 days of sending that check to the clerk's office the property
owner is not getting interest on that amount, and so section one would
just treat DOT like everybody else. Section two of the bill authorizes
the court, in a condemnation case, toward a reasonable attorney fee,
appraisal fee, and engineering fee, if the final judgement obtained by
the landowner exceeds the amount of the initial deposit by 25% or more.
The attorney's fees are not to exceed one third of the difference
between the original deposit and the judgement amount and of course that
will be up to the judge's discretion. Like I said earlier, there is a
fiscal note. I wanna thank fiscal staff for turning it around from
yesterday's transportation committee so quickly. There's no fiscal
impact for the next two years. The fiscal note shows up minimal impact
for the following two years, and then beginning in 2017, 18, there's a
fiscal impact estimated between four hundred and sixty five thousand and
three point four million dollars. From the fiscal note, there's a
provision I wanted to read to you because this summarizes how the bill
sponsors feel about this. &quot;There's a disagreement exists as to
whether this agreement will increase or decrease the number of jury
trials. Incurring the additional costs of fees may encourage the DOT to
increase settlement offers and avoid trial&quot;, and that's hopefully
exactly what will happen. The DOT will make a fair offer to the property

Rep. Stam: Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, of course, I support the
bill itself. The amendment is purely technical. Staff came to me and
said the way this was formatted in handwriting in committee yesterday is
not the way we'd like to see it in the statutes. There's no substantive
change in the amendment.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Further discussion, further debate on the
amendment.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Stam for the House committee substitute
number 2 for House Bill 272. All in favor vote aye; all opposed vote no.
The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine and record
the vote. 111 having voted in the affirmative, none in the negative, the
amendment passes.
We're now back on the bill. Further discussion, further debate.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the House
committee substitute to House Bill 272 as amended, on its second
reading. All in favor vote aye; all opposed vote no. The Clerk will open
the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 110
having voted in the affirmative, 1 in the negative, the House committee
substitute number 2 for House Bill 272 as amended has passed its second
reading and without objection will be read a third time.
Clerk: General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Further discussion, further debate.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the House
committee substitute number 2 for House Bill 272 as amended, on its
third reading. All in favor say aye, all opposed say no. The ayes have
it. The House committee substitute number 2 for House Bill 272 as
amended has passed its third reading. The bill will be engrossed and
sent to the Senate.
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
Rep. Moore: Motion pertaining to today's Calendar.

purpose.

The Speaker Pro Tempore: Will the Representative yield?
Rep. Moore: I do.
Rep. Luebke: Can you explain the urgency of why we have to add this to
it today, as Calendar, instead of waiting for tomorrow so that we'd have
more notice?
Rep. Moore: It's just going to be a motion not to concur with changes
the Senate made; that's it.
Rep. Luebke: Thank you.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Without objection, so ordered.
House Bill 10. The Clerk will read.

is a motion to not concur.

with the Senate committee substitute for House Bill 10 and request that
conferees be appointed.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: The House will be at ease.
(Strike the request.)
