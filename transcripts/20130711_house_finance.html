<p id="00:00">
Good morning and welcome to the House Finance Committee. If our members
will take their seats, we’ll try to get started. We have a rather long
agenda this morning. The people at the back are having way too much fun.
Our first bill up this morning is going to be Senate Bill 43, Study
Savings for Administration of Claims. Senator Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman. This bill was recommended by the Joint
Legislative Committee on Workers Comp, Coverage Compliance and Fraud
Prevention and Detection. What the bill does is it directs the Office of
State Personnel in conjunction with the Department of Public Instruction
and the Office of State Budget Management to study the expenses related
to the management of state and local government employees’ workers’
compensation claims and make recommendations for improving efficiencies
and reducing expenses. During our meetings we found out that there was
an issue here that needed to be taken care of. In some areas, workers’
comp claims were… I can’t remember the exact percentage because it’s
been a while, but it was quite a bit over the norm, so I think a study
surely needs to be taking place and see if we can kind of reign some of
this stuff in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move a favorable report to Senate Bill 43. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We have a motion for a favorable report. Further questions,
discussion or debate? Seeing none, Representative Brawley’s motion is
before you. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed, no. I believe that’s unanimous. Senator Brown, who
would you like to handle the bill for you on the floor? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would you like to handle it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Our next bill up is Senate bill
1159. Senator Tarte requires certain general reappraisals. Senator
Tarte, welcome to the House Finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam
Chair, members. I appreciate it. The bill that’s before you is to enable
Mecklenburg County to fix problems that occurred in the 2011 property
reevaluation. This bill has unanimous support from the Mecklenburg
delegation; it has unanimous support from the Mecklenburg Board of
County Commissioners. That may be an all-time first. And that’s the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. As a member of that Mecklenburg delegation, I
would move approval of this bill in the appropriate time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It’s the appropriate time. Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I just wondered, Senator, if you could give an example of one
of the errors, kind of error. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The kind of errors that
occurred? Well we had… One simple one would be where we had two
properties side-by-side. One would be a third acre, the other would be a
half acre, and the property values were set at exactly the same value.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How’d that happen, if I may follow-up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It is a long story, but what they started doing is using a set
value for all properties in the area, and then they just applied it to
everywhere, and it’s that kind of egregious error they’re trying to fix
now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have a motion before you to give the bill a
favorable report. Any further questions or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I know this bill is drafted to address a problem in
Mecklenburg County, but it is a statewide bill. How many counties are
there like this that would be eligible for reappraisals? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Madam Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As I
understand, the bill would potentially enable 14 counties that meet
certain criteria. The criteria that are specifically outlines in this
and the degree of error, the only county right now that fits this is
Mecklenburg. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now tell me again about the 14 counties that were potentially meet the
criteria. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The criteria, the one that drives it
includes its population, so size. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions
from the committee? Anyone want to speak from the outside? Seeing no
hands, we have a motion from Representative Samuelson to give this bill
a favorable report. All in favor will say aye.</p>

<p id="05:00">
All oppose no. And I believe Representative Brawley will handle this on
the floor for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next bill up is Senate Bill 290, Waynesville annexation. Senator
Davis, welcome to the Committee.  Representative Brawley is recognized
that we have the PCS before us for the purpose of discussion.  All in
favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All oppose, no.  Senator Davis you have the floor sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman and Members of the Committee, I’m back with
the Waynesville annexation. Could we have the proposed Committee
Substitute explain the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?  Representative, Mr. ??, we’re on Waynesville.  I’m sorry,
Gregory Meed will explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The proposed Committee Substitute, the only difference is the city of
Waynesville discovered there were errors in the mete and bounds
description. That is in, that describes the property that’s going to be
annexed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair. Would you ask the gallery to come to order please so I can
hear the gentleman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Going to ask the folks to please take your conversation outside of this
room if you need to have one until we’re finished.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To start again, the PCS all it does is it takes the original bill, but
there was an error in the property description that the Waynesville
discovered.  It had donut holes in it and it also had typographical
errors.  And so the metes and bounds description was changed so the
typographical errors were removed and some old donut holes were removed.
 And so it was always the parcel that’s trying to be described has not
changed, it’s just the errors and admissions have been corrected.  And
then other than that, the PCS ?? original bill, it just adds this,
described ?? to the town of Waynesville’s corporate limits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman.  I’d like to remind the Committee that this
is not a forced annexation, this is an annexation that Lake Junaluska,
the organization went to the town of Waynesville and asked for this. The
delegation from Haywood County is unanimous in its support. I’ve talked
to some people that have some concerns about this. I’d remind you that
60% of the home owners at Lake Junaluska are non-residents and so they
can’t vote on a referendum. But if the Committee, if somebody would like
to amend this motion to require a referendum we’d certainly be open to
that, if necessary.  It’s not our preference but we’d be open to that.
The way it is though they’ve spent about $60,000 polling the members and
the residents and they have about 2/3 other people that are in favor of
doing this friendly annexation.  I have individuals here that would be
glad to answer any questions including Mr. Joe Stowe who has about 4
years experience in the utility business and he is a Chair of the Lake
Junaluska Board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Committee, Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is the Lake Junaluska Assembly Incorporated?
SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will defer, we have people here that can answer the question
technically if the Chair will recognize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, if you will come to the microphone and give us your name and your
position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Jack Ewing, I serve as the executive director of Lake
Junaluska Assembly Incorporated. In 2008, the Board of Directors was
formed for Lake Junaluska Assembly Incorporated. As the successor body
to the Southeastern Jurisdiction Administrative Council.  It is the body
that is responsible for making decisions about the Conference and
Retreat Center as well as the residential component.  There are 1200
acres within Lake Junaluska and Lake Junaluska Assembly Incorporated is
the official name of the governing body associated with that 1200 acres.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. That means that is a Methodist Church.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct sir.  The Southeastern Jurisdiction of the United
Methodist Church.</p>

<p id="10:00">
Representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair.  My question I guess would be for Mr. Ewing or
bill sponsor about indication that the council is over the Conference
Center Retreat Center and there are about 1200 acres. Does the council
own the 1200 acres and is the council elected by the residents of the
1200 acres?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Ewing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.  The 1200 acres is not owned by the Conference
Center Retreat Center, I’m sorry by the Board of Directors.  Individual
property owners of the, there are 811 individual pieces of property.
Some of which the Conference Center Retreat Center are owned by the
Board of Directors and therefore by the southeastern jurisdiction.  What
the southeastern jurisdiction does own are the pavement, the pipes and
the easements associated with the residential component of  Lake
Junaluska.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Is there any election held by the property owner of the
members on the council or how are the property owners represented?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are 2 persons who serve with voice and vote  on the Board of
Directors. There are 32 members on the Board. The President of the
community council, the Junaluska Assembly Community Council is elected
by the property owners and the Lake Junaluska Property Owners
Organization is also elected by the property owners. So those two are
elected by the residents of Lake Junaluska.  The remainder are either ex
officio as the bishops, there are 3 bishops that serve on the Board of
Directors and then there are 24 members on the board of directors that
are part of a self-perpetuating Board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And are all of the 24 members and the 3 bishops required to be members,
excuse me, property owners or residents of Lake Junaluska?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are not.  Approximately half are property owners at Lake Junaluska.
 But it is not a requirement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. I just want to, probably for staff or for the
sponsor, do we have a map on this?  Is there a map available? We do have
a map that we could distribute. Sorry Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We don’t’ have one.  Mr. Ewing do you have a map available for the
Members of the Committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do. There is, we have one copy right here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair if I may we did have maps for Members of the Committee at
one of the previous meetings but we don’t have one today I apologize for
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the request of the committee that they have a map, I’m going to ask
Sergeant-of-Arms to make proper copies and we will temporarily displace
your bill, Senator Davis. We’re going to skip down to House Bill 569
Representative Boles, because he has another commitment and needs to
move this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mrs. Chair.  This is a amendment to the Foxfire Charter to
voluntarily annex a subdivision that is outside their contingence.
They’ve already supplied the infrastructural water sewer, and as a
property have sold, they automatically volunteer to come into the city,
the village of Foxfire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Boles, do you know of any opposition to this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then a motion at the motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s the appropriate time, Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to make a motion we give a favorable report to House Bill 569.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I might, I’m a vote for your bill but I did something similar some
18, 20 years ago and I’m still hearing about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is from the developer that.</p>

Further questions from the committee?  Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Representative Boles, isn't the town of Foxfire the one that
we had to have special legislation for a couple of sessions ago to fix
another problem they had?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.  And the people donated the land to the village.  And
so...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does this involve that property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir.  That was property that the heirs inherited, and they gave it
to the village, which was, I hate to say, fifty or sixty acres.  But
this is a private development of a subdivision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions from the committee?
Any outside interest?
We have a motion to give House Bill 569 a favorable report.  All in
favor will say Aye.  All opposed No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I guess you'll handle your own bill on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[LAUGHTER]  Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me go ahead and try to take the last House bill, House Bill 1015,
Bessemer City annexation is back before you.  Representative Hastings,
you're handling this bill.  You have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we've been before this committee before and since then...we
actually had the maps and all the information but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chairman.  I've looked at this; I've spoken with the
bill's sponsor, and I'd like to move for a favorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions from the committee?  Anyone from the outside that
would like to have input?  Representative Hager moves to give House Bill
1015 a favorable report.  All in favor will say Aye.  All opposed No.
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, are you available, sir?  Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've been here the whole time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm so sorry.  You were hidden in the corner and we didn't see you.
Senate Bill 488.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair.  Members of the Committee, the Nursing Home
Administrator Act.  ??  If you look at the bill.  We've got an amendment
also, Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, you're recognized to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's a very simple amendment, members, I believe.  You can do it without
paper.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  On page three, lines thirty-two and thirty-three, it simply
changes under that number nine to read:  alcohol or any controlled
substance.  Technically alcohol is not a controlled substance so we had
to put the alcohol in front of the controlled substance rather than
behind it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair, may I ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You certainly may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??  and we just wanted to clarify that alcohol was not a controlled
substance.  ??  This just clarifies that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, if you could put the microphone on, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??  Yes, ma'am, I've done that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you want to repeat your comments on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.  Prior to the meeting this morning, staff brought to me the
fact that we needed to designate the fact that alcohol was not a
controlled substance.  It was improper language in the bill, so this
amendment simply corrects that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the amendment, members of the committee, any questions or concerns?
Representative Collins has moved that we give the amendment a favorable
report.  All in favor will say Aye.  All opposed No.  We're back on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair.  May I go ahead?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, thank you.  Back on the bill.  As a solid member of the baby
boomer generation, I have a special interest in making sure nursing
homes will be there and properly run when I get there.  So... [AUDIO

<p id="20:00">
I have worked on this bill and what it does is, it changes the
requirements for Nursing Home Administrator form 2 years to 4 years,
having a Bachelor Degree in that current curriculum. It also will allow
someone with a 2 year degree, but having 5 years of Nursing Home
Administrating experience to be able to get a license. It also raises
some fees. Currently, the fees have not been raised since 2004. So
that's pretty much the gist of where it is. I think they are currently
running a deficit in the Nursing Home Administrating Board because they
have not decided over the years to raise fees and keep up with various
costs. That's kinda where the bill is. I'll be glad to answer any
questions, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Samuelson. I'm waiting for a motion, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I'll make a motion that we go favorable to Senate Bill 488.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
As amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
As amended. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You heard the motion...
Representative Carney
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I thank you, Madam Chair. Question, please, for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, ma'am
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Tucker, I'm just curious, I was glancing down through all of
these fees and it seems, it would appear that the majority of them
doubled. Why is, why such a drastic increase?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That, that's. May I answer, Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Carney, that is a fair observation, although that's not
the reality they tell me. They're going up 25 and 50 dollars. I also
have a fiscal note that the fees could raise up to 45,000 dollars in a
total year over all the nursing homes across the state. Based on what
they've told, but yes, that gives them a range. The rule-making process
to have a fee changed sometimes takes 2 years, so they just did this to
give themselves the latitude to raise the fees because they've held them
since 2004.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up, Representative Carney? Good.
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I'd just like to know, Senator Tucker, what kind of feedback have you
gotten from the Nursing Home Group on this? Do they like it, don't like
it, or don’t care?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Sir, in fair response to your question, I have not received a call. This
bill has been floating around for 4 months, and I've not received a call
from any of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mrs. Senator Tucker. This is the second time this session
that we've seen a bill coming in saying that you've got to have a 4 year
degree before you can get a certain job, and I continue to be troubled
by that. Can you tell me what the rationale behind that is, because
while that might be desirable, do we really want to make it a
requirement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Well, this is at the request of the Board. As you know, well as I
stated, people with 2 year degrees and 5 years of experience can still
receive licensure. All those people who currently do not have a 4 year
degree or a 2 year degree but have been in the industry can continue to
receive a license. The requirement for a 4 year degree certainly would
raise the bar of professionalism in this curriculum. As you know,
Representative Starnes, healthcare is so complicated, and so the
requirement of a 4 year degree, which I do not have and have done OK
without it, and I understand your point, the 4 year degree would require
a higher technical skill than a 2 year degree.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
And the way I read it, if you have a 4 year degree in Art History then
you'd be qualified to run a nursing home?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That's, that's right, sir. You would be. Real Estate too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Madam Chair, I believe I'll have an amendment proposed to strike that
language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You're free to do that.
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
In support of that amendment that'll be coming, if the Bachelor's Degree
had to be in a related field I'd understand it, but they're striking the
language that allows the Board to do rules about accommodation of
education and experience acceptable, so they would have to accept the
person with the degree in French, or Art History, or music. Those are
all wonderful fields, parlez-vous francais?</p>

Yes sir, you certainly may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Linguistics professor from Maypex?? I can support that amendment with no
problem at all, gentlemen. I can, I understand where you’re coming from
on that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnesworth, your amendment sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s on the way, but basically it will just strike the provision
requiring the four year degree, and it may take just a moment for the
staff to have it prepared.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll just stand at ease for it.

If we’re going to outlaw foreign ??, will allow foreign debate to be

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re going to ask
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re not going to go there, everyone just y’all relax for a few
minutes. Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
While they’re preparing the amendment, I was going to ask a question
about the amendment. If we just strike the piece about requiring the
degree, are we just leaving in the piece about the nursing minimum
experience and doing nothing with all the other language that was
struck? I just want to make sure that that’s what you want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I have not had a chance, obviously, to consult with them. We’re
just really going back to what they already have. Would be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Restored the language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They’re going back to what they already have. A two year degree, five
years experience.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And eliminating the French degrees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know they will just be at ease until we get some maps and some
amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members will come back together. We’re going to try to run this
amendment without having copies made. I’m going to ask Trina from our
staff to explain said amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So what the amendment does is that it amends Page 1 of the bill, Lines
13-27.  And it’s basically undoing all of the strikethroughs and
underlining. So it’s restoring the current law. And that’s all the
amendment does. So it would just</p>

My understanding on most of these projects is that they usually go
through the relevant governing body of the university system and then
they go through the Board of Governors for approval to be sent to the
General Assembly.  I don't believe that there is a actual student vote
on these projections but again UNC might have something to say on this
specific project.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes.  Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  On that same question, if I might, get
Representative Stam and ask.  I was provided a few talking points by the
University on this issue about the multiple levels of approval that the
projects go through.  This is for any of the projects in there.
Apparently, these are student supported projects, which would include a
student fee increase and would be and would be a vote of the students
and the Campus Board of Trustees would approve and then the Board of
Governors would approve it, then the legislature reviews it and then it
goes apparently back to the Board of Governors to get final approvals.
That's how the process was explained to me on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Samuelson does that address your
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you, that does address the question so I have
a quick comment.  I've also been told that the Winston-Salem delegation
supports keeping it in there and that the Board of Governors, including
some of the members that we appointed, also think that this is a good
idea so I would be inclined to not support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.  Who currently owns the Racetrack and the
stadium now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mark Bondo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Currently, the stadium is owned by the City of
Winston-Salem and they own the Racetrack as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Follow up then.  Has this been a profitable venture
for the City of Salem?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  My understanding from looking at the Winston-Salem's
budget and CAFER is that the operational component of this usually
breaks even but the debt service component of it normally requires,
because there is outstanding debt through the city, and it normally
requires general funds support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak on amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I hope we will support this amendment.  We shouldn't
be getting the universities into money losing propositions.  The City of
Winston-Salem has decided that they can't operate this track and make
money, it's costing them when they figure into debt service and the
university's going to buy it and they're going to balance this budget on
the backs of the students and you can talk about well we've got a
process and the students get to vote and they have a say-so.  They're
going to be saddled with another $110 per year to pay for a racetrack
that gives them no benefit as well as helping them get an education.  At
some point in time we've got to draw the line and try to make it more
affordable for kids to go to school.  So I support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  On the amendment, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I have a question of staff is alcohol currently
allowed at the racetrack?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes. Yes sir, again Mark Bondo with fiscal research.
 Yes, currently alcohol is allowed at the stadium for races and in order
to keep that practice going forward there needed to be an amendment to
general statute to allow Winston-Salem as a state entity to continue to
allow alcohol sales at the racetrack.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Brawley a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Follow up.  So there is a provision in this Bill
that allows alcohol on the facility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I believe he's shaking his head.  Mark?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes, that's correct.  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Hanes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Madam Chairman.  I was wondering if there
was anyone here from Winston-Salem State to add some information
regarding this stadium please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Sir, if you'll come to the microphone at the back
and give us your name and your position please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  My name is Cornelius Graves.  I am Director of
Government and Community Relations at Winston-Salem State University.
Throughout this process we've consistently engaged members of the
Winston-Salem community, the City of Winston-Salem and our delegation.
To this point, we've received unanimous support from our delegation, as

Bowman Gray Stadium. We’ve had over 50 years of a relationship with
racing. We hope to continue this relationship in perpetuity. There’s
also academic benefit from the standpoint that we do have a racing and
sport management program. It’s a four year degree program. It’s actually
the only four year university in the country to offer a Bachelor of
Science degree in motor sports management.
[Speaker Changes] Members of the committee, do you have follow up
questions for the gentleman from Winston-Salem State. Representative
Brawley.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, madam Chairman. In addition to the benefits
of the racetrack, I get this sense that this is a larger property, and I
wondered what the university wanted to do with the rest of it other than
the racetrack.
[Speaker Changes] Sir, you may ??.
[Speaker Changes] Yes. At this point I actually would like to have our
Vice Chancellor of Facilities, Owen Cooks, to come up and give a little
bit more information on that aspect.
[Speaker Changes] Good Morning. Owen Cooks, Associate Vice Chancellor of
Facilities at Winston-Salem State University. The acquisition of Bowman
Gray Stadium, Civitan Park, and the surrounding lands is a key component
of our campus master plan. It’s comprised of 94 continuous acres
adjacent to our campus, so it would almost effectively double the area
of our campus. We currently lease the property for Winston-Salem;
there’s actually a series of leases. We lease part of the property for
commuter student parking; we lease part of the property for student
recreation; we lease part of the property for athletic venues. In
addition to the stadium, we have our track, our outdoor track in that
location, football practice fields, and so on. And so for all of these
purposes and uses, we see this acquisition as a key component of our
master plan.
[Speaker Changes] Madam Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Hanes, yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] Question for Mr. Cook. Could you give us a sense of
what the University’s plans are for Civitan park area moving forward.
[Speaker Changes] Sure. The master plan for Civitan park, we’ve
developed several facilities — the track I spoke of early, the football
practice fields. We’re also hoping to build a baseball and softball
field in the Civitan park area. It’s in a low-lying area, so it’s really
not suitable for building development but a great opportunity for
athletic fields, expansion, both for recreation or athletics department.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Jordan.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, madam Chairman. Questions for the guests.
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] First of all, you said there was current leases on the
property?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] What is the benefit to the University of getting out
of those leases and actually owning the property, considering its a
brown field site.
[Speaker Changes] Currently the leases give us the ability to seek
permission form the city of Winston-Salem to construct improvements on
the land, and we’ve done so with that practice field and the track. But
if the lease were to terminate, or end at its natural time period, we
would lose all those improvements and all the capital investment that
we’ve done on that site so far. The other benefit is just a financial
one: we would no longer be making lease payments in an ownership
position, and be able to improve that land without necessarily going
through the city process.
[Speaker Changes] Further question?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] What’s going to be the additional operating expense to
the university that will come out of its budget for this new
acquisition.
[Speaker Changes] Currently, by the lease that we have with the city, we
actually have to take on a lot of the operating, for instance, the field
house that serves the Bowman Gray Stadium now, the current lease calls
for us to manage about 90% of the operation and maintenance expenses of
that facility currently. Now a lot of that is covered by athletics and
auxiliaries because of the uses of that, with the exception of our motor
sports management program, which occupies a small portion of that
facility.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] So the amount is what, 180,000? 200,000?
[Speaker Changes] I think that’s in the fiscal note that MarK Bondo
provided. I didn’t bring mine up here with me to the podium.
[Speaker Changes] Mark, would you like to…
[Speaker Changes] Yes ma’am.
[Speaker Changes] If you look at page 10 of the fiscal note, there is a
section for operating revenue. That service fee revenue from the new fee
and then operating expense. So for the first fiscal year, 2013 and 14,
operating expense is projected to be about 858-860 thousand dollars per
year, and then the debt service expense on top of that would be about
490 thousand dollars. And then revenue would be about 880 thousand
dollars. And the debt service fee revenue would be about 581-582
thousand dollars.</p>

Representative Starnes.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you. When was the last time this track was resurfaced?
[NEW SPEAKER]
It's been several years, sir.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Follow up.  So, racetracks have an extremely high maintenance cost.  So
if in the next couple of years the track has to be resurfaced, can you
give me an idea of what that's going to cost and how you're going to pay
for that?  $110 under the numbers in the fiscal note, you don't have
enough money there to pay for track maintenance.
[NEW SPEAKER]
What we try to do in the operating side of things is build in a
maintenance reserve for all of the property and the associated
improvements that might need to be made, and so that's how we would
cover the repair and renovation of the facility in that time.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Follow up, Representative Starnes.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Well then, one other question.  This was built on an old city dump or a
landfill or whatever. What type of liability do you assume since you are
buying a brown field.
[NEW SPEAKER]
When we were going through the do diligence study to find out the extent
of that old landfill was, and in doing so, we believe that seeking a
formal brown field agreement with us as the potential purchaser and the
city as the seller, would be prudent to protect our liability going
forward.  But we didn't find anything in that Phase 1, Phase 2
environmental that gave us cause for concern. Based on the types of
developments, we're wanting athletic fields and things that are pretty
much restricted to the surface of that area.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Holley.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you Madam Chair. First of all, I commend the university on trying
to be proactive and obtaining a stadium and a facility that is right
next to campus, to allow for it's future growth. This seems to be well
thought out.  I think that they've done an outstanding job and just like
any other university in the UNC system, they too would like to have a
stadium and a field and some of the other amenities. They've found a way
of doing this.  They've found a way with low overhead.  The students
have even agreed to this and I don't think that this amendment is a good
amendment and I vote against the amendment.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Collins on the amendment, sir.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Yes, on the amendment. I can understand why the Winston-Salem delegation
is solidly behind this. Because we're basically taking something that
City of Winston-Salem has half a million dollars of debt service a year,
if I'm reading right, and now putting it on the state tax payers.  I'd
love to do the same thing for a lot of facilities in Rocky Mount that we
have debt services on.  But I'm here to represent the tax payers of my
district and of this state.  I think for the City of Winston-Salem it's
a great deal. I think for the state it's a horrible deal. So I support
this amendment.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Tim Moore on the amendment, sir.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Yes, ma'am.  I think this is a good bill.  But the amendment, I thought
about this yesterday when a person talked to me about it and at first I
was resistant to the amendment. But I looked at it and I think by
passing the amendment we may be doing Winston-Salem State a favor. I do
worry about what Representative Starnes got into which is potential
liability.  You can have brown fields agreements. But some of those
still may require further remediation or some kind of actions to be
taken.  There's also, we know of situations where water contamination
pops up after the fact, and again depending on how the brown fields
agreement's struck there may or may not be liability.  So I think I'm
going to go ahead and vote for the amendment, to take this out.  But I
just was curious from the University's standpoint.  Are you guys really
sure what you're biting off on this thing, asking for this, from a
liability standpoint?  Because I really have some concerns for the
University and also even for the state, in taking that one on because of
the fact it is a brown field site.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Anyone?
[NEW SPEAKER]
We believe we do.  You know, part of this process, should this bill go
through as it was originally written, is we still have to go through the
Department of Administration's state property office and all of the do
diligence that they do in the consummation of any transaction, be it the
purchase of land, facilities or leases.  So there are do diligence steps
we've completed to date that brought us here today and there are
additional do diligence steps that will be completed prior to this
transaction being complete, should it be approved.</p>

Representative Blust on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Question, the fee of 110 dollars is that per academic
year or is that per semester?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That’s per year, FTE, students.  So for somebody
who’s not a full-time student that fee gets pro-rated down but it’s per
year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes Madame thank you on the amendment and this is for
the university as well the most redeeming thing I heard you mention in
the discussion is that you’ve got a program at the university and that
the race track may serve to train some of those students.  Can you
elaborate on that or explain it a little further.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I see some difference of opinion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes we have four.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Sir again if you’ll identify yourself for our
records.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Cornelius Graves, government and community relations.
Winston Salem State.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We have a four year Bachelor of Science degree
program in motor sports management at Winston Salem State University.
The only four year university in the country that offers that type of
program.  There have been numerous studies, one recently by the North
Carolina motor sports an economic impact development study, which
forecasts about 24 thousand jobs that impact the North Carolina economy
are based on motor sports.  So we’re actively pursuing the educational
opportunities that equate to jobs in North Carolina and motor sports
management is one of those programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Just quickly, so the track would be used in some way
in that four year degree program?  Is that what I’m hearing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes we have students who train as mechanics.  We have
students in the program who actually train as pit crew management
officers.  We’ve recently an opportunity for students to participate who
are athletes in the program.  We’ve invited folks off campus to come on
and participate in the program to get an interest into it.  So it’s
something that we’re actively pursuing growing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  If I might ask the gentleman a question, follow-up on
the motor sports issue.  Do you use the track as a test track in your
training? And by the way I congratulate you on your reputation in the
motor sports business.  You are recognized as a leader.]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Do we use the track as a test track in our training?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For motor sports management.  Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Not to my knowledge.  No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  What do you use the track for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It’s where our motor sports management program is
housed.  We have the classes on campus.  There are opportunities and
times where we do take students out there but it’s not used as a test
track.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  So when they go out there they just look at the
track.  They don’t drive around it or anything?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  No they don’t drive vehicles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes Sir Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Do you pay the city for that use?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’m sorry.  I thought I was going to help you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Collins?  Representative Moore on the
amendment?  Representative Blust on the amendment?  Representative
Haines?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Madame Chairman.  I heard Representative
Jordan.  I’ve set quietly because I wanted to hear all the comments and
I wanted to give my colleagues a chance to say their peace and now I
want to talk about my personal experience as a citizen as a young man
who also grew up in Winston Salem and had the pleasure of having every
member of my family attend that university except my father who attended
North Carolina Central  University but I also wanted to speak of a place
where I grew up and where I had the good pleasure of starting my
professional higher education career and talk with you a little bit with
regard to the growth of that university and where it’s going.  It is not
the acquisition of a race track and I think I heard it put that way.

<p id="60:00">
The racetrack. This is a learning laboratory in every sense of the word.
What is going on with the Bowman Gray and ?? Town Park site right now is
the only the beginning of  the opportunities that Winston Salem State
will have before it. Because it will have not only access but ownership
of this track and this  facility.I absolutely foresee and I believe that
the leaders of the program there foresee using that facility, that
learning laboratory in every sense of the word going forward.The program
is only going to grow. It’s the only one of its type. And is a
recognized leader in the motor sports education right now. I think if
anyone looks at our NASCAR,looks at the NASCAR numbers and how it’s
performing overall, it is the second fastest growing sport in the
country. And Winston Salem State has done a great job of taking on,
taking on a program that will train students to get jobs. Some of the
26,000 that are out there to put into our workforce. And that is what
we’re here focused on. That is programs that create jobs. Winston Salem
State is doing that. Most importantly, most importantly however though,
we need to look at this as an opportunity for university that has come a
heck of a long way in its 135 year history. This university was founded
as a normal school and as a school that trained teachers, and as a
school that ultimately grew to team up with the Reynolds Companies to
train folks to work in an industry that built our triad and built our
city. That school has grown into one that has joined the University of
North Carolina system and that educates all of our children now. Not an
university that is singularly focused any more. So it's an university
that's willing to create jobs,to grow the triad, and to grow the State
of North Carolina. This is a part of that growth. One of the true, one
of the true issues that the university faces is that it is landlocked.
And the university through, university through relationships with the
city, and through strategic growth initiatives over the last 10 or 15
years has found a way to make it. So that they can survive and thrive
going forward. And that was jump, it was a reach for them. Several years
ago, when they said we’re going to start a Motor Sports Program, who’d
ever thought it. Who’d ever think that a school that has traditionally
trained, that has traditionally taught and educated majority-minority
population would say we want to be a part of motor sports and they did
it and they were well received. We’re not in this to take away the debt
from the city, we’re in it to invest in our students. And in a majority
of students who are the third or fourth poorest student population in
the State of North Carolina. These kids are finding a way to come to
school. And they’re finding a way to get themselves involved. And to
educate themselves and lift themselves up through their own efforts. And
that is what we all say here in the General Assembly that we want, we
want motivated students, and we want motivated educators. And we want
people who are going to push in that way. And I believe that granting
Winston Salem State this opportunity will allow them to do that. So
clearly, I’m going to be against this amendment. We have to invest. This
is a learning laboratory. It’s going to continue to grow. And I’m going
to ask everyone in this room to support these students who continue to
work hard and this university that continues to work hard and vote
against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions from the committee on the amendment?
Representative Brawley on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Brawley one then then Brawley two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that’s one way to tell us apart I guess. Thank you, Madame Chair.
I’ve,  I’ve listened to the debate on this. There’s several things that
have come to mind. First, I’m always a number’s guy and I figured out
they’re getting the land for $76,000 an acre and a then a stadium and
racetrack is thrown in for free. The bill is going to require them to
keep the race going. This is one of the oldest races, if not the oldest
race in NASCAR. And if somebody were coming along to do something that
would stop this race, we would really be up in arms to defend the race.
They've agreed to do that and in fact kind of bring it into their
program. The program comes across to a lot of people as a little silly.
But I used to sit in front of a guy at the basketball game that started
the NASCAR Motor Sports Engineering Program at</p>

Charlotte and started a bandit racing team and everybody laughed. You’re
not designing those cars. But he said we’re learning to operate a race
team. And people quite laughing when his first class graduated and those
kids got jobs at $100,000 a year or more. This, you know there’s a lot
about this that’s out of the ordinary. It seems a little silly. And I
understand the questions about Brownfields. I have little experience
with that where Brownfields has been redeveloped for industrial parks.
This is not really an unreasonable use. The point they’re saying this is
92 acres adjacent to their existing campus and their landlocked. That’s
a reasonable thing. There’s a lot of questions. There’s been a lot of
review. I’ve got one at UNC Charlotte, one at Western. I’m gonna have to
pay those housing fees. The tax payers aren’t. I wish you all would. But
I know who’s paying that. At some point we gotta trust their judgment.
They have to live with this. So I’m inclined to oppose the amendment and
let the school do what they want to do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairman. Speak on the
amendment. I would like to support Brawley the younger. [LAUGH] in
opposing this amendment. We have elected [UNKNOWN] might I ask
Representative Stam a question first? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Stam is not is [CROSSTALK] in a position to defend or, to, or the
amendment. [CROSSTALK] what he gave me. He’s just carrying the bill Mr.
Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know Senator
Apodaca’s position on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Well, I really
wasn’t interested in that. [LAUGH] What I was interested [CROSSTALK]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] got four minutes before we can vote on this big bill.
So I’m gonna wrap it up. [CROSSTALK] Brawley, Representative Hager.
You’re all Representative Brawley let’s [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would speak
against the amendment. We’ve got, we’ve, this body has elected a board
of governors. The board of governors have has recommended this. And the
motor sports is important to the state of North Carolina. And once
[UNKNOWN] is known for it. And this is a part of the program. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Anybody else in the committee wanna, wanting to speak on the
amendment? Anybody from the outside wanting to speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairman. I’m Del Fallwell/g private
citizen from Winston-Salem. We killed this two years ago. The actual
board of governors’ minutes reflects that this project was taken off of
the bill that is before you. I’m here today to ask you on behalf of
tourism, on behalf of students and on behalf of state taxpayers that you
support Representative Jordan’s amendment. This is an article that
appeared on all your desks in the last five days. This is what happens
at Bowman Gray Stadium racing. This is no more than an acquisition of a
racing facility. They did not even have an executive director of this
racing program. They have less than two dozen students in the program.
And I can tell you that I was also a student at Winston-Salem State.
What you haven’t heard is this. The number of students that voted for
this is less than 12. What you haven’t heard is when I asked the
chancellor to his face if the city is losing money on this deal how do
you intend to make money on it? And his answer back to me was that he
was going to staff it with volunteers. You cannot run a facility like
this every Saturday night with volunteers. I would tell you that at end
of the day when you vote for Representative Jordan’s amendment, that you
consider the students. It’s not $110. It’s $500,000 a year, in the words
of Representative Hanes to the fourth poorest student campus in North
Carolina. This was killed two years ago. And I end by this Madam
Chairman. If this were your money the bottom line is that they use this
facility I’ve asked for a copy of the canceled checks of what it cost
them. There are no canceled checks. If somebody were offering you a
facility to use every year that you didn’t have to pay for would you go
out and just say thank you instead of putting $500,000 a year of student
debt on the people [CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Fallwell/g. Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen we gonna, we have a
motion on the amendment. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The ayes obviously have it. Representative Stam you are
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair I move that the amendment be
rolled into a new committee substitute. Committee substitute be given a
favorable report unfavorable to the original bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
have a motion on Senate bill 480 as amended. All in favor</p>
