Senate will come to order. Sergeant-at-arms would close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery,
please silence all your electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer
is the reverent Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in
the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us pray. Oh mighty and everlasting god, you love
everything that you have created and you have created all that we see
and hear and taste. Forgive us, your children for assuming that we can
live our lives without you. You are the vine and we are the branches.
Thank you for that. Thank you for your amazing grace how sweet the
sound. May we carry the tune of your grace with us throughout our lives.
The tune when you showed us your grace and Jesus, help us to believe
what you said as your ancestor said, love the lord with all your heart
and with all your soul and with all your mind and love your neighbor as
yourself. May our worldly duties, our laws here reflect your perfect law
and may it spread the fragrance of thy love, our lord. It’s in Christ’s
name that we pray. Amen.

Senator Apodaca said I didn’t qualify for that. He said that was for
amateurs.  In any case, I was contacted by two district court judges,
one of which who was a senior court judge who felt that it was important
to bring to the attention of this body that when unemployment benefits
get reduced, it also affects the ability of people to pay child support.
 And he thought it would have an impact on those who receive child
support through our system.  So I told him I would bring that to the
attention of this body. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: I rarely speak at this chamber so I wanted to have
this opportunity to stand and debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: Senator, you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]:  Thank you.  Members of the Senate, we have a real
problem here. $2.5 billion shortfall that we owe the federal government.
 There are a lot of causes and we heard a good debate yesterday as to
what those causes were that got us in this hole.  But we all agree that
this is a big hole and one that’s essential we get out of. The fun must
be solvent. If you put too much of the burden on the businesses, then
tax rates, which North Carolina is one of the lowest in the country on
our suited taxes.  I think we’re 42nd, 43rd in the country. We put too
much on the business and our tax rate gets out of whack.  Makes it hard
on those businesses to compete, makes it hard for North Carolina to
compete.  Similarly, if you put too much burden on people who lost their
job through no fault of their own, and are actively looking for work,
which is who we’re talking about, and their families, you create real
hardship for those families, but also for their local communities. Their
landlords, their supermarkets, their gas stations, everywhere where they
spend their little bit of money, they need in order to keep their
families going for the period of weeks that they are unemployed. A
problem like this requires a balanced approach. And what I regret is
that the bill that is before us now is not balanced  It is not a bill of
shared sacrifice. For every $1 that is borne by the business, there are
$2 in permanent cuts for unemployed workers. The number of weeks, we’re
going from 26 weeks, to 12 to a 20 week sliding scale.  Only one other
state in the country uses 12 to 20 weeks. 45 states use 26 weeks. We had
a very reasonable amendment yesterday that set along 20 states, It would
put us at the very bottom of the country. Everybody else is at 26, but
ya’ll rejected 20 weeks, and went 12 to 20. The way you calculate the
income on what the unemployment rate is paid is, we’re the only state in
the country that does that, and it results in the lowest amount in the
country. We put amendments to make this bill fair, they were rejected.
Then there was the issue about the sunset.  Let’s put a sunset on this.
If the business taxes go away when the debt’s repaid, let’s have these
cuts, I mean these benefit reductions borne by workers go away. Then we
can reevaluate what the system should look like.  That was rejected.
And that’s the most surprising, most harmful, or most telling, was your
rejection of the amendment, that simply knew the effective date on all
these drastic cuts ya’ll are proposing to the beginning of next year so
that we could continue to draw down long term unemployment benefits for
people who are having a very tough time finding a job.  We heard about
counties where there’s 17-18% unemployment. There are two or three
applicants for every empty job in North Carolina. And to pretend that
they’re not just finding jobs because they don’t want them is really
callous.  It also is just shocking that you all are willing to forgo, at
no cost to the North Carolina taxpayer, $780 million in economic
transfer to unemployed workers, which results in $1.5 billion in
economic activity in counties where there are unemployed people. We have
an unemployment problem in North Carolina and ya’ll are rejecting $1.5
billion in economic activity at zero cost to the North Carolina
taxpayer. We’ve taken up three major bills and so far, I got a little
tally going, that’s $3.5 billion in economic activity this year at no
cost to the North Carolina taxpayer that ya’ll are forgoing. We should
be about getting the economy going again. I urge you to vote against
this bill on third reading. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?</p>

Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know it’s amazing to me that someone says something long enough they
believe it to be the truth. And I heard a lot of talk yesterday from
folks that we didn’t care about people. One, we didn’t care about
people, number two that we accused unemployed people of not looking for
work. I don’t believe I ever heard that uttered out of one majority
mouth yesterday.  I think we’re all very concerned, we all believe the
best thing we can do to help someone unemployed is help find suitable
employment. Find more jobs. Create more jobs.  We have had testimony in
Committee where companies have come to North Carolina, very interested
in coming here but stopped short and said have you corrected your
unemployment problem?  And we could not tell them yes.  And I think that
companies held back, I’m not sure but it’s my understanding Senator
Rucho, that they have not made a commitment to come yet. We’re still
hoping they do. Because it is in an area of the state that we really
need.  So to say that we don’t care about people, it’s just totally
false and wrong and I just wanted to bring that up because I heard we
were saying folks don’t want to work.  We never said that. We believe
everyone wants to work and they want a good job and to provide for their
families. It takes care of most problems we’re facing. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Senators, I want to just let you
know,, a leave of absence has been granted for Senator Nesbitt as well
today.  There’s no further discussion or debate, the question before the
Senate is the passage of Committee Substitute to House Bill 4 on its
third reading.  All in favor will vote aye, oppose the vote no. Five
seconds will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will record the
vote. 36 having voted in the affirmative and 12 in the negative.
Committee Substitute to House Bill 4 passes its third reading.  It will
be ordered enrolled and sent to the Governor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Senator Apodaca yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, he yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Rucho, yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
From past history, and even today don’t you think this oximeter deserves
a new home?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Senator I think it’s displayed where it needs to be displayed and
I’ve said this over and over and Senator McKissick mentioned it, we do
not award to professionals.  It violates the amateur status of the
oximeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 50.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 50. Discharge veterans, identity theft protection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bingham is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate.  The
registered deeds in Montgomery, Davidson had brought this to my
attention.  There had been some incidences where folks had taken
identity of veterans when it comes common knowledge of a 50 years from
their DD214 or social security number.  This in fact corrects that.
There was also a technical correction when we got into this and found
some of the letters to be incorrect in statutes and this is also the
technical correction that will be included in this bill.  I appreciate
your support and would be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any  further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the question before
the Senate is the passage of Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 50 on
its second reading. All those in favor will vote aye, oppose the vote
no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will
