To debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Under current law cities must serve notice to
chronic violators of public nuisance ordinances by certified or
registered mail. A permit violator, for your information, is the
property owner who has received three or more notices in the previous
year. The problem with the registered and certified mail is in many
instances the chronic violators are absentee property owners that do not
live in the neighborhood, or either they refuse to accept the mail or to
claim delivery of the mail. This Bill allows in addition to the
registered or certified mail that the municipality may also spend notice
of taking action by regular mail and by posting a copy of the notice in
a conspicuous on the affected property. If the regular mail is not
returned by the post office in ten days this additional method will be
considered sufficient notice. I ask for your approval of this Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate? If not, the question before

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s been recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the House version of
the Senate Bill, and what it does is allows a court to assess court
costs in 50B and 50C actions. It does set forth three things the court
must find before doing it and that is that the person who filed the
action was in fact not a victim, that they filed the action knowing they
were not a victim, and it was done for the purpose of harassing the
other party. I will tell you there’s still some controversy over this,
and I told Senator Tarte that I would pass this bill at this time that
he will have the Senate not concur and will get a committee because
there’s lots of interesting discussion. And it is an issue we really
want to tackle. So I’d ask for your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the House, if there’s nothing more riveting
than corporate law. This bill is 51 pages long. The synapsis I have is 5
pages single-spaced. So I’m going to try to be very brief and just give
you some highlights. This is a Bar Association bill. The intent of the
bill was to provide certainty in a more detailed framework and structure
to allow members of the North Carolina Limited Liability Company to be
confident that their management and ownership arranges will be
accommodated and enforced at law. There’s a clarification of matters
that can be agreed upon by the members. In other words, you can have an
oral operating agreement in addition to your written operating
agreement, which gets us a little past parole evidence. It harmonized
where appropriate, the rules under the Foreign Liability Corporations
Act and makes certain clarifying changes there. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It does override some portions of the UCC Section 9-406 and 9-408. If
you get a certificate of existence from the corporation, from the
Secretary of State, then it gets issued that way but you don’t
conclusively rely on that, you may need some additional information. A
last couple of things that it actually makes changes to. It deletes the
Low Profit Limited Liability of the L3Cs that we just passed a few years
ago. The corporation said they never needed those to begin with so it
really is more about cleaning up. I’ll be happy to share this summary
with anybody else who wants greater detail. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a question of the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Reluctantly because I’m not a corporate lawyer either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Now my clarification was
there’s really no substantive change in just the kind of cleaning up
details and getting stuff out that’s not necessary but in directions as
new, any kind of certificate significant changes in requirements or
anything are not part of this, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there are a few things that would-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? That’s permission to answer.</p>

<p id="020:00">
...there are a few significant changes. For example, it used to be that
things had to be in that operating agreement, had to be written in
greatly detailed. Now, because so many people were doing them orally
anyway, it's allowed for some oral management agreements. So I will not
represent to you that there are no significant changes. There are some
things that have been in the corporate world that they've sort of been
doing anyway, and this just gives them the legal authority to do what
they've been doing. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the sponsor would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, reluctantly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In all these 51 pages, is there anything in here about
B corporations, is there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is nothing in here about B corporations. And we
actually took away the L3C's, too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] See if Representative Stevens will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, on page 6, line 17, item
number 28. What is the reason for having a $200 fee for the annual
report and is that fee or any of the other fees in this section, do
those represent increases from present fees?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding that there were no increase in fees.
Absolutely none.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mister?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you have any idea why the annual report is $200
or do I need to find out from someone else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can get you that answer. I don't know that I can
give it to you right now. You have a problem and want to object to
third, that will be fine, I can get it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I might be able to answer Representative Blust's
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding when LLC's became popular, when they
started about 15 years ago, but now they're much more popular. They are
a lot easier and more efficient to run than a corporation. You don't
have to keep all of the corporate minutes and all of the formalities of
a corporation. And so what happened was, the public policy was,
corporate reports were only like $20, $25. They put a heavier fee on the
LLC just because they were easier to run and didn't have all the
formalities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 439 on its second reading. All in favor vote

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, my ?? back here
think that because this bill has been on the calendar for a week there
must be something wrong with it. But Representative Blackwell, I can
assure you it's just because we hadn't reached it yet. Wake County
School District is now, I believe, the largest in the State and maybe
about the 20th largest in the nation. And that has its advantages and
disadvantages. I'm sure you all have, everybody in the State has an
opinion on the Wake County School District. I won't share mine with you,
unless you provoke me into explaining it all.
But this bill, a majority of the delegation, House and Senate, believes
that this bill will solve some of the problems with the Wake County
School District. Certainly not all, but some. And let me tell you what
the three major changes are.
First of all, in the past we have had, just like many of your districts,
odd year elections in October and November when we've had 5, 10 or 15
percent turnout. I remember a runoff even lower than 5 percent in recent
years. One thing the bill does is move the elections from odd number
years to November...</p>

<p id="025:00">
...of even number years, so that a maximum number of people will
participate--I guess they can all participate, in October of 2013, but
they don't. So, a maximum number, and as you'll see later, the terms are
staggered, and most of the members will be elected in presidential
years. So, a maximum number of people will participate and therefore,
they are less likely to complain.
Secondly, whenever you switch from an odd number to an even year, you
have to either shorten terms, or extend terms. And I think there was
some legitimate criticism of the original bill that certain people's
terms were shortened, other people's were extended on an improper basis.
That wasn't the intent or the case, but we changed it. It only extends
terms for members elected in 2011. They will have a 5-year term instead
of a 4-year term, and that includes the current 5 members of the board.
No term for which a member has already been elected is shortened. What
we do in 2013 is to elect members for 3-year terms instead of 4-year
terms, but they haven't been elected to that yet. In other words, they
know going in, that they are running for a 3-year term instead of a
4-year term.
Another problem with a very large school system that we have, with
children being transported all over the county, is that often children
will be assigned to a school not even in the district where their
parents live. And so, they find it difficult to get responsive
representation from the member where their child lives, or sometimes
they find it hard to get responsive representation from the person who
represents them. So, there's been a lot of talk through the years about
let's have a majority that are elected at large, so you can be able to
elect a majority. Well, the difficulty with that is that this is a very
large county, and that would make these raises extremely expensive for a
majority of the members. So, the compromise that we came up with is that
every person will have two members to elect. One in number districts,
and another one in letter districts. And they, of course overlap. So,
you will elect two different people in 2016, so you can call on two. If
you don't like one person, you can always find the second one.
Now, because we're adding the 2nd, overlapping district, that means we
have two choices. Should we just add members? And I believe there is an
amendment to just add a couple of members, but that would give us 11
members, which we believe is just totally unwieldy, and does not make
for good decision making. So, what we've done is made seven individual
districts and two overlapping districts. The terms will be staggered and
will remain staggered to maintain some continuity.
And with that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer two amendments, taking
LB74 first, if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, you are recognized in the 4th amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is ALB74V2. Representative Stam moves to mend the bill on page one,
lines 20 through 22 by deleting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, you are recognized to explain the amendment,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a minor filing date change suggested by the board of elections,
so that it will coincide with the filing of the soil and conservation
people, so there's not three different filing periods in that same year,
just two. I haven't heard  any controversy about this minor amendment, I
offer it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, do you wish to speak of the amendment?
Representative Duane Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Martin, do you wish to speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Holley? On the amendment?

Further discussion? Further debate? If not, the question for the House
is the Stam amendment, amendment number one to Senate bill, House
committee substitute student bill 325. The clerk will let the machine
record, and we'll take a vote.
All in favor say aye, all opposed no.

line sixteen, page seven line two by rewriting those lines to read

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't expect the members of the other party to endorse the village
itself. I'm hoping they'll agree to this amendment,because I told him I
wanted to run it unless I'll take a great what it does is slightly
change the districts. there was a news report that said it would give
these two members safe seats. that's not the case, but it does put to
members during combat in districts that they have a decent chance of
winning instead of put them in a district that they can't win or would
be difficult to win so this was to maintain continuity on the scoreboard
for two very highly respected members of our urgent.

thank you are much, ladies and gentlemen, you know, there is a saying
that we've heard quite. they are, you can put lipstick on a PA he
amendment does that accept it might put a little village or it might
finesse our own on God Philippines and even though it does what
representatives than that, it would did reluctantly one of them over and
ask you to support that minute, but I thought the inlet to visit of the
wake County a great deal
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
for the discussion for the debate, if not quite through the house is

Mister Delaney Hall, director don't direct that they can be members of
health, the first dialect do is list your represented Blackwell that
yes, there is a whole lot wrong with this bill. most members, and here
are obvious you don't represent wake County, but you're all aware that
the turmoil we go there in recent years with our school boards is made
state wide is made national news, and this recent Senate attachment draw
districts again has has to state objectives of had a chance to listen to
the settlement offer talk about it. the first objective is to ensure
greater turnout by changing our school board elections to even years of
favour greater turnout as well. I think we all are, but I disorder among
the members. there's a reason that most school board districts across
the state are on odd years, and that said are not partisan. I guess that
the decision. each have to make yourself whether you want our orgy next
to every single race. we have
no management. the second stated objective of this is is he's got a lot
of complaints that parents could always vote for the school board member
where their child going to school and I'm in favour of that objective as
well. but this bill doesn't come close to doing</p>

I'm not sure how we people have the macro problem but they printed out
again force at the dashboard but if you guys will look at the the large
map one of the top these of the new district lines and they are way less
geographically compact the oldest tricks which results in an obviously
making it less likely that a parent can vote for the school board member
with her child to go to school one of these new districts I think Ackley
touches goes on edge touches five different counties are different
personalities there is one other way that this bill also attempts to
assure the apparently but for the school board member and what they got
here they created to really large regional districts and that the other
macro to take a look at the smaller one in the right-hand corner so go
look at the pink district they've drawn the middle look off to the north
eastern side of it is a long look at Gooseneck with a head turned
backwards it's got another had little to the west and north side of it
was like a dog that turned backwards and then the South West corner it's
got what looks like a bifurcated tail in the point of the point all this
out is I get it makes it extremely likely deliver one of the small
appendages and you're not vote for the school board member were your
child actor goes to school another thing I like to point out is the
predominant reason that a parent usually can vote for the school board
member for the child as the school or at least it is the most counties
is because they send their child of magnet school so when I do that
there there voluntarily send their child outside of districts are
completely aware of it in addition I know we have quite a few members of
Starbucks school boards and at all with both parties standard site if
they advocate for one score one theater district they were advocating
for the entire school system even if this bill good achieve the
objective that the object of the talks about I feel against it because
it's just something that we should be doing right now the North Carolina
Constitution clearly says that the health of the Senate shall not redraw
districts but efforts and your senses North Carolina state law made by
the body also makes clear the school board districts should only be
redrawn every 10 years now current maps in place were drawn by
Republican they were drawn by Kieran Shanahan who was recently appointed
by Gov. McCrory had public safety the maps cost my County $40,000 that
redraw map and reprinting these maps the call was the mail out our voter
ID cards is the cost of wake County another quarter million dollars so
I'm going to urge the Republican members of the South developmental and
let us keep our current maps that were drawn by Republicans for
Republicans and that you guys wanting in 2010 and and you can win again.
don't put our County through another redistricting for whats clearly
don't be seen everywhere is surely a blatantly politically partisan
reasons I'm no vote on this bill it's also the conservative thing to do
its because its going to save  the my County a quarter of a million
dollars and urged the members to do so[SPEAKER CHANGES]. what purpose
does the representative ?? ??[SPEAKER CHANGES]. its to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].will you recognize the bill thank you very much Mr.
Speaker members many of yall who have been here more one term have been
through redistricting and that ordeal and we know what that meant for
our constituents as they were moved from district to district their
people that I represent now that still think Jennifer Weiss represents
them that's in my own home precinct but my point is is that when we
elect school board members we elect state legislators we like the Gov.
US Senators U.S. House representatives or water votes registers of deeds
the public then pays much attention to stuff as we do I couldn't even
tell you all the elected folks that represent me democracy is hard work
and folks were about to lose the public there confused I'm not
suggesting we take away jobs delectably thought since that we need to
make it easier for what</p>

10 years Redistricting is confusing enough and we have to come back and
do it when the court reorders it or predicting that's confusing but we
gotta do it but when we just pick up and do what Tom DeLay did in Texas
they decide to  redistrict is for partisan advantage we lose the public
whether it's Democrats that do it whether it's Republicans it do it
remember the largest growing voting block in North Carolina nationwide
is not Democrat it's not Republican its folks are fed up with games like
this the Democrats and Republicans do it if you want to increase turnout
we need to be making the box user for not turning people off to vote as
I look at this map I right here  this proposing these districts it
brings me back to exactly where we were just a couple years ago we did
across the entire state of North Carolina is exactly what were doing to
my home county once again wake County and i only been back for about two
weeks but if you talk to her folks crying for this I think if you talk
to folks the serve from wake County the public wake County is not run
out for this I got emails in support of this where it got numerous
emails in opposition to it by for this are folks who side lost in the
Republican drawn districts is ripped apart put out the last election and
one of the reshape claim it's just us its elected officials called for
this sort of thing the public doesn't want to hear it in there to lose
faith if we continue to pass bad legislation like this I hope you'll
oppose it  [SPEAKER CHANGES] representative holy which purpose do you
wish to be reconized for [SPEAKER CHANGES] speak to the bill [SPEAKER

be redundant from what my colleague from wake County im not going to get
into some of the same things about  what they arleady said you heard it
and you heard before we all know what this is its a larger government
taking over local government I heard numerous times from the body that
people locally govern themselves we all know that the people wake County
should know best im sorry how the elction came out the way it is, but
this is what you get what some people I said all is well my child goes
to school over there well person in this room was a district that
repressed this will represent you in the school member representing like
me to people that you can What we do expect that people make is
ammendment[SPEAKER CHANGES] at all you recognize a sent-forth ammendment
to demand the billing page 15[SPEAKER CHANGES]
line 48 by adding the following line 48-49. all this ammendment does is
that it allows people in the upcoming November election whether or not
they want to change the way the school board is voted upon what I want
to do is make it part of ?? ?? ?? ??with an idea of whether they want to
do a doughnut hole for another district lets let the people of wake
County make that preceded it is a local issue thank you [SPEAKER
CHANGES] and  yes [SPEAKER CHANGES]think you speak one of t?? ?? ??make
a good point that local government knows best and yes it's like County
commissioners that it asked for this bill and their elected by many
hundreds of thousands of people and they want to see that the school
board is facing the same electorate of hundreds of many hundreds of
thousands instead of the tiny few the vote in odd and even the usually
odd number of elections how point out on the amendment  you know it
suppose it but it would not take effect until November 2014 which means
that the people who would be elected in 2013 would have no idea what
they're actually running for when they run and I guess the other thing I
could mention is that if we put referenda on every local bill well we
can put referenda on every local bill and I don't think we want to start
the that[SPEAKER CHANGES] further discussion further debate</p>

Question before the house is amendment 3 of house committee substitute
senate bill 325. All in favor say aye. [Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker?
[Speaker Changes] Yes, representative Gill [Speaker Changes] I would
like to speak on the amendment. [Speaker Changes] You are recognized to
speak on the amendment. [Speaker Changes] Thank you very much. You all
just heard that from Representative Stam that is was the majority
members of a current board of county commissioners who requested this.
But let me just say that they did not request this map that we have
before us. What they requested was to have four district representatives
and five at large. They were very disappointed when this map came out
and most of them did not want to support it. And I can imagine the
republican majority from Wake County told them that they had no choice.
So I don’t want you think that this something that was requested by the
majority of the county commissioners. And I also want you to know that
the school board did not vote nor did they request a change in school
board elections. And the citizens of Wake County did not request it. So
I ask you to please support it; the amendment and let the citizens of
Wake County make the decision on how they want to elect their school
board members. [Speaker Changes] What purpose does Representative Grier
Martin wish to be recognized for? [Speaker Changes] to debate the
amendment. [Speaker Changes] You’re recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend from Wake County, Representative Stam. I agree with him
completely that we don’t need to put every local bill before referring
them to Latlow County. That would be chaos. And there’s a reason why the
general assembly got the ability to do local bills. The people of North
Carolina expect us to be big boys and girls. To resolve local petty
partisan conflicts that are unable to be resolved in local level. And
they bubble up to the general assembly and we’re the big boys and girls;
the adults. We resolve it. However, here, what we’ve got is just the
continuation of the next level of the partisan’s squabbles that are
going on in Wake County. If we’re unable here, as adults to solve it in
a non partisan way like we should, then I do think we should put it to
the people of Wake County to decide. So I urge you to support this
amendment. [Speaker Changes] What purpose is Representative Murry to be
recognized for? [Speaker Changes] To debate the amendment  [Speaker
Changes] You’re recognized to debate this amendment. [Speaker Changes]
The chair in the Wake County Board of Commissioners testified in the
house collections committee for the bill that we have before us. And so
while there might be some level of controversy on whether this is
exactly what the Wake County Board of Commissioners asked for or not,
they are pleased with this legislation. They testified in favor of this
bill in committee. Now I ask members to oppose this amendment. If there
is a concern about the cost of implementing this bill, where is a
current cause of concern about implementing a referendum in a year and a
half from now. If anything, we should do the referendum sooner if you
wanted to do it. And that would a have a tremendous cause. That’s why
this bill; this amendment is being run but to put it off until November
14th, 2014. That’s when there’s a wide general election. The problem is
here now.  Folks in our district want to have more than one voice on the
school board. They’ve only got one now. They got two members of
congress. They got two members of the general assembly. Vote for
multiple members of the county commissioners got one school board
member. And so this about voice.  They want the voice today. They don’t
want to wait until November 2014. do I’d ask members to oppose this
amendment. [Speaker Changes] Representative Duane Hall, what purpose do
you wish to be recognized for? [Speaker Changes]  to ask Representative
Charles Malone a question. [Speaker Changes] Representative Malone?
[Speaker Changes] I’m Sorry [Speaker Changes] Representative Duane Hall,
is there another Representative you wish to ask a question of? [Speaker
Changes] Representative Rosa Gill. [Speaker Changes] I’m sorry? Say
again [Speaker Changes] Representative Rosa Gill. [Speaker Changes]
Representative Gill, do you yield for a question? [Speaker Changes] I
will. [Speaker Changes] Representative Gill, when you served on the
school board, did you advocate for position of one school? Or I guess
the question is, was your job to represent a school or a school system?
[Speaker Changes] As a member of the Wake County school board, I
represented the entire student population even though I was elected from
a district. [Speaker Changes] Thank you, can I speak on the amendment.

[Speaker Changes] Had spoke out for this new map. What you didn’t hear
was that parents didn’t come out and speak for it, the teachers didn’t
want this, and also the school board itself didn’t want this. You just
heard that one county commissioner said they wanted this. I urge you to
vote for the amendment.

All wishing to vote, do so now. The clerk will lock the machine and

back on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Jackson, you are recognized to debate
the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I want to send forth the
amendment. But I would like to debate the bill, I can do that first.
[Speaker Changes] I can read your mind, Representative Jackson.
[Speaker Changes] I’ll debate the bill first. Members, I’m gonna ask you
to vote against this bill, for the same reason you’ve heard my
colleagues. I’m gonna give you four. First: passage of this bill will
not accomplish the goals of county commissioners. They ask for four at
large seats, so that every person in the county would elect the total of
five and that would be the majority of the school board, of course,
thats nothing what this bill accomplishes. I heard tonight that the
chair of the county of commissioners who is my Representative on the
county commissioners came to elections law and advocated for this bill.
For the life of me, I can’t understand that. We live in the pink section
of this map, if you’re looking at it, he and I both do, and I can tell
you that precinct 1004 has absolutely nothing in common with precinct
803, other than they’re both in wake county. But I can tell you that we
will no longer, my part of the county, have a member of the school
board, because it will be elected from up here. Thats just how the
demographics work in Wake County. The second one is the bill sponsors
said that they wanted to make sure you had a representative who
represented you child’s school. I think Representative Haul mentioned
the magnet school, but as you can see, there jus a donut. The bottom map
is the actual at large seats, theres the green one that goes all the way
around the county, and so you’ve heard some people advocate for this
bill and say, well this is a compromise for at large seats, because
those are expensive and difficult to run in. Well this seat, the green
seat, you still have to cover the entire county, you just can’t be
driving through your district when you’re going form one end to the
other. So if you stop at a school in the middle you’re no longer in your
district. But you still have to cover every single municipality in Wake
County. So thats not gonna do you any good. And the chances are if your
child does not live in your local district they’re not gonna live in the
green part, they’re gonna go to school in the pink part, which is where
the magnet schools are in wake county. The third reason I wanted to tell
you why you should vote against this bill is because business community
and Raleigh Chamber of Commerce are against it. And I’ll get to
Representative Martins point about being the adult in the room, or the
mature one, if anybody had occasion to watch the joint meeting between
the county commissioners and the school board. Its been two or three
months ago, it was televised, it was about a 3 hour meeting, I actually
watched it. If you’ll fast forward to the last hour, you’ll be
absolutely embarrassed by how they behaved. Name calling, talking over
each other, its absolutely embarrassing. And the business community in
wake county wants nothing to do with this bill. And thats gonna bring me
to my fourth point. Because the reason that they don’t is because we’ve
got a billion dollar bond thats gonna be on the ballot in November. Now
what you’ll hear is the actual numbers 810 million. Thats new money. if
you add in the existing money thats being budgeted in this bond, as well
as the maintenance of effort and everything that the county
commissioners are going to have to put in. Its over a billion dollars,
and if we go about doing what we’re gonna do tonight, people like myself
will not support school bond. And I’m ashamed to say that publicly,
because this is the first time I’ve done that. But I have told my county
commissioner I cannot support that. And so what you’re gonna have, is
you’re gonna have people like me, in my part of the county who will not
support this school bond. Why would we vote for a 5 cent tax increase if
we’re not even gonna have one representative on the school board? So
when you take people like us, and you combine us with Wake County Tax
Payers Association, which is against all these bonds, generally, what
you’re gonna have is you’re gonna have a resounding defeat on this bond.</p>

and when that happens, Rep. Gill's district, she's not going to have any
trailers and mobile classrooms. And Rep. Holly's district is not going
to have any, and it'll probably be a few years before I have any. But
Rep. Stam, Rep. Dollar, Rep. Murray, their schools are going to be
overcrowded, and it'll  be because of actions this general assembly
took. So Mr. Speaker if I could, I'd like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jackson, you're recognized to send forth an amendment, the clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jackson moves to amend the bill on page 1 lines 2 and 3 by
rewriting those lines to read,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jackson, you are recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
What my amendment would do is keep the current 9 districts that, as Rep.
Hall explained, were drawn just in 2011 by the Republican majority, and
they would add 2 true at-large districts. I believe that would make the
bill truly non-partisan. I know that's something I could support, I know
it's something Rep. Gill and some others could support. It would give
everybody in the county 3 votes out of 11 on the schoolboard. My
amendment does not mess with Rep. Stam's changes to when the election is
held, about participation, I think that's something we can all get
behind. There  was some mention about how 11 districts would be
unworkable. Do you know that the school board size, even at 11
districts, would be larger than your House seat? The schoolboard
districts are larger than your House seat. So I don't think moving to 11
districts with 2 of them being at-large is going to be a bad thing at
all, and I think the final thing is I think if we can come together and
vote for a bill as amended, then we can pass the school bond in Wake
county, and that's what's best for all the citizens at wake county, I
know it's best for my children which are in Wake county public schools.
I'd ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam, for what purpose do you wish to be recognized for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'd ask you to vote no on the amendment, the county
commissioners, majority county commissioners concluded that having 11
members on a board would be dysfunctional to that board, and  I believe
they're right. Secondly, for the 2 members who would be at-large, it
would be making their election expenses 9 times as expensive as it now,
or maybe even 50 times more because &quot;at-large&quot; would be very
competitive on a county basis, whereas a lot of the individual districts
are not. When you break them in 2, then it's only half as much. It's not
a matter of how far you travel, most political advertising at this level
is done by the mail, and mail is delivered by mailpersons, and they know
how to target mail, and so it would be twice as expensive for those 2
people, and we just don't need to do that. I ask you to vote no on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Carney, for what purpose do you wish to be recognized for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I served in Mecklinburg county on the county
commission, at-large. &quot;At-large&quot; is the circumference of the
boundaries of Mecklinburg county, very similar to the distance of the
distance of the Wake county boundaries at-large. When I first came in
and looked at the new map, and we've had these maps on our desk for a
whole week, and we're just really getting into the debate tonight of a
local- to me, a local issue. But when I looked, I had to go and ask the
representative from Wake, this green and pink map are your two at-large
seats? It was really hard for me to comprehend when you say
&quot;at-large&quot; having served at-large the whole county of
Mecklinburg, that this is really confusing to me and to the citizens of
the county. So, to take away all of that confusion in the midst of the
State House, redrawing local districts, the least we can do is to
support this amendment and make these 2 at-large seats exactly what the
term &quot;county at-large&quot; means. I urge your support of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Glazier, for what purpose do you wish to be recognized for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I really wasn't really going to debate, although I want to follow up
with Rep. Carney's point. In Cumberland county we have at-large and
district representatives for the county and for the school board, and as
she said for our county &quot;at large&quot; means &quot;at large&quot;
and the full county. But she's made that point so my other point to
make, and what triggered me to stand up, was Rep. Stam's comment a
minute ago. Rep. Stam, an answer to Rep. Jackson's eloquent argument on
the amendment</p>

said well we don't want to do this because it will make those districts
more competitive and therefore drive the costs up. Well I didn't realize
we were redistricting to make districts less competitive.  I thought the
purpose of redistricting and democracy generally was to create
competitive districts but apparently that's not the case. It seems to me
that we would want to be doing that and if in fact Representative
Jackson's amendment will in fact make competitive districts, which is
what we all want, then I'm going to be supporting his amendment.  Thank
you.

for which do you wish to be recognized for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you very much.  i just want to share a little
bit about Wake County with all of you here so that you can better
understand what we do here in Wake County.  Having taught in the County
and served on Wake County school board for ten years I want you to
understand we have a great school system and the reason why we have a
great school system is because we give every child in Wake County an
opportunity to choose three different schools, starting with an
elementary school, their middle school and their high school.  We have
what we call a feeder pattern.  That means that if you choose one of the
schools that your child is assigned to then that child will follow the
feeder pattern all the way through to high school.  So most parents will
know when their kids start kindergarten where their kid will attend
school if they choose a tradition school, if they choose a year around
school or if they choose one of our magnet schools.  So the parents know
pretty much where the kids will be attending school even before they
start kindergarten.  The problem is that we have limited capacity in a
lot of our schools, especially those schools in the high in the density
area of Wake County and if your child by some chance is not able to get
into one of the schools they do have a choice.  Most of the time the
difficulty the parents have is over student assignment and you know when
I was on the school board some parents would come after being in Wake
County for about 3 months and decide that they don't want their kid to
got to the school that they had been assigned to because members of
their church, family, children do not go to that school. But you just
can't change schools in the middle of the stream because we have to make
sure that every student in our school system has a seat and we want to
make sure that they are all in a good school and that they all can reach
 their educational potential.  In all of the discussions that you have
heard on television you have not yet heard any of the members who want
to change the district talk about parents complaining about the quality
of the education that their child receives and the reason for that is
because all of the board members that I have served with believe that
every child should have an opportunity to reach their educational,
academic potential. So we've had during the ten years that I've served
on the board, we've had a majority Republican, we've had a majority
Democrat.  In fact the year that I was supposed to to be chair of the
board I allowed a Republican to be chair of the board.  You know why?
Because the chairman of the County commissioner stood in the paper and
said if Rosa Gill becomes chair of this board you all haven't seen where
we're going to cut your money off.  Now anybody that can stand and make
that kind of statement and now this same County commissioner is the one
that's requesting this change.  I want you to think about that.</p>

Representative Corney asked about large i put that bill in years ago we
couldn't get the allegation considered back in so they was put forth now
somebody comment that in elections zones somebody were strangely ??
attendance zones for school if you wanna see some strange you should
look at those how they have morphed and changed over the years and
that's what ?? lot of parents and i give you an example because i have a
child in public schools here he had three different during the time ??
he had three different assignments for middle schools kept changing
every year to you get a potential signer from middle school and finally
sort fully it came all around the way he started parents out there and i
have been to number of public hearings spoken at public hearing and i
have talked to number of parents public hearings there is lot of support
for making the changes we have got here in this county it does two basic
things this proposal does two very simple things one it increases or
doubles the members of school board members that will individual in ??
to vote for you used to vote for one now  you select two of those nine
so you are doubling your voice in the school board if a voter here in ??
county and that's a good thing and other thing it does is takes the
elections from the odd year October when hardly anybody shows up  to
putting him in the general election years you will have more people once
this bill is fully enacted there will be more people vote for</p>

...board members in one election will have voted in all of the school
board elections in the ten prior years. That's the difference. Now we
say that eduction is important. It's our top issue, most important
issue. Then for heaven's sakes let's have the best opportunity for the
most people in Wake County to have an impact on the election of those
members of the school board.  We can do this with this bill and out a
dollar. We appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gill, what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the speaker a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, can you tell me a little bit
about your district? Is that one of the fastest growing district's in
Wake County?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Part of it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there enough seats in the schools in your district
to accommodate that growth?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well I'm supporting the bond issue so that we can
ensure that we have enough seats.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's the future, if the bond passes but we're
talking about currently.  Is there enough capacity in your area to
accommodate the students from your area?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The law requires you have a seat for every student so
I'm not quite sure where the question was headed, but I will say this.
With this bill you will have more people in Wake County participating in
the election  of members of  the school board than you have ever have in
the history of the school board in Wake County and you would be able to,
for the first time in years, be able to vote for more than one person.
You will have greater representation and more people participating in
the process . I think that's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think earlier you said that your son, who is
now..who did or that is still may be currently attending Wake County
schools, had to go from one school to the other. Did you understand why
at the time that his assignments were being changed? That the growth in
that area did not have...we could not meet the growth.  We could not
meet the capacity for students because of the tremendous growth in the
Cary area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We offered all kinds of alternatives to a lot of the
plans that were there. I testified at public hearing myself but frankly,
we didn’t get listen to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Reverend Lucas, what purpose do you wish to recognize?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To reluctantly speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. I've listened to this debate
now for about 45 minutes and it's gone on and on and on and as I've
listened it dawns on me that we are debating, at the state level,
something that ought to be settle in Wake County. Why is that here, I'm
beginning to ask myself. Why don't we allow the people of Wake County to
tell us what they want us to vote on. And seems to me that's what should
be the order of the thing..the issue but I also recognize that I have a
vested interest in Wake County. I have two grandchildren with ten
schools in Wake County. One of them just served as a page her in March
and I ask him and he says “papa, this is all about politics, it's not
about children.” I said ah. why in the world are we politically
involving ourselves in school children in Wake County? Let's let the
school board and the citizens of Wake County solve this.  We have no
business in this and I urge you to vote no on this and if you don't vote
no then I know that it's politics.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion for the debate? If not,  the
question for the House is the passing of the house substitute for the
senate bill 325 on the second reading.  All in favor, vote aye. All
oppose, vote no. The clerk will open the vote. All wish to encore will
do so now. Representative Larry Bell. Clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote.</p>

of The House, without objection, rule 12H is suspended. Is there
objection? That is the coat rule. So ordered. Representative Grier
Martin please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker can we just name that the prior Gibson
rule. Thank you Mr. Speaker. When I was a freshman the first time the
lady from Mecklenburg, Representative Earl said to us new freshmen that
we should be seen and, and not heard. I didn't listen to her then and
here in my second stint in being a freshman tonight I'm certainly not
paying attention to that dictate either so I hope you all forgive me.
But, but I say with complete sincerity to my friends in the majority
party that their, their willingness to tackle tax reform in North
Carolina, it, it needs to be done. We're all aware here that we've got a
mid 20th century tax system that needs to be brought in the 21st
century. And there are plenty of us in the minority party that would
join you in a sincere attempt to move our tax system forward in the 21st
century. In the six months that I've been gone I tried not to follow
what went on down here too much. But when I saw that you were gonna
tackle tax reform I had hope because I know that there's plenty of
people of good will on both sides of the aisle and I thought this would
be an attempt to really do something that needs to be done. I regret
though when I got back and took a look at the proposal that's emerged,
that it's really just more of the same thing that I endured in my final
two years here. Just more attempts to place the burdens on the working
people and the middle class of North Carolina at the benefit of the
richest in our state. And I regret that's what this proposal is.
Insteading of moving, instead of moving our tax system from the 20th
century toward the 21st century it's goin in completely the wrong
direction. Ladies and gentlemen this proposal before you now moves us
out of the 20th century and into the 19th and I'd like you to vote
against it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baskerville please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. I did, Representative Lewis, take time over the weekend
to try to think about this particular proposal, analyze it, and I was
thinking about this thing and I saw a commercial on TV, an advertisement
that came on from a conservative outfit that said let's get back in the
game North Carolina. I happened to be reading the news papers a couple
of weeks ago and one of our colleagues was quoted as comparing the
protesters outside to cameron crazies on Duke and Carolina game night.
And that the protesters were trying throw this member of of his game.
And here we are again tonight, playing games again. Telling a majority
of North Carolina, North Carolinians that this proposal is going to
lower their taxes when in fact this tax plan is one of the biggest tax
increases for most North Carolinians that we've ever seen. When you look
at the income tax rates, and then you also consider the new sales taxes,
taxes on electricity, alter-, alterations, car repairs, hair cuts at the
barber shop. North Carolinians know that their taxes are going up, not
going down. For example this is from staff, fiscal research. A married
couple filing joint with two children. If they make forty thousand
dollars a year when you look at the income tax and the sales tax, they
will get around a forty two dollar tax cut. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If Representative Baskerville yield for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Tell the truth then. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you make
a million dollars. You'll get a 12,523 dollar tax break. If you make a
four million dollars, you'll get a 62,518 dollar tax break. How can you
look at someone's pocket book if you're not taking into consideration
what they're paying in sales taxes as well as what they're paying in
income taxes. Anything else is not a accurate picture. This is why most
North Carolinians would call this tax proposal yet another Republican
tax cut for millionaires. Sounds like a.</p>

...gain to most North Carolinians, when Republicans claim that we must
cut taxes for corporations so that those corporations can be
competitive. And yet, North Carolinians read article after article that
says North Carolina consistently is recognized as having an outstanding
business climate, like the July 2012 council on the state of taxation
and Ernst and Young study that ranked North Carolina number 1 in the
lower state and local tax burden on business, like the July 2012 survey
by CNBC that ranked North Carolina number four in the top states for
business. Like the December 2012 articles in Forbes Magazine that ranked
North Carolina number four out of all American states in terms of best
states for business and number two in terms of the best states for
business cost. These type of gains that have been played up here are
short sighted. This bill is unbalanced. What is real, however, is the
impact that this bill’s going to have on hardworking North Carolinians.
Fire teacher’s assistance so they want to give millionaires a tax break.
That handicaps our teachers in the classroom and their abilities and the
quality of our education. Let’s gut our gem, our flagship, the UNC
school system so that we can cut corporate income taxes. This turns what
could be a bright future for college student into a future darker,
riddled with uncertainty and debt. And, on top of that, this so-called
Tax Simplification and Reduction Act does nothing to address the $3
billion worth of sales tax and use exemption and rebates that riddle our
statutes today. Ladies and gentlemen, stop playing games with North
Carolinians. I urge you to vote no to this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville, I understand your reluctance for tax breaks
for millionaires. On Wednesday, June 5th, at 8:30 in the morning, would
you explain to the House why you voted for half a billion dollars of tax
breaks for multimillionaires. In committee, in the appropriations
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which bill are you talking about, Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I answer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 998.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that not what we’re voting on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to ask a  member a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this not what we’re voting on tonight?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, like I said, Representative Stam, after I had a chance to do the
research…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the…Representative Baskerville, the gentleman will yield.
Does the gentleman wish to be recognized to debate the bill a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then I believe this discourse is completed. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, the chair should have stated as I came in after the first member
was recognized by agreement with the minority. We’ve agreed to two
members each side debating the bill. Representative Baskerville and
Representative Martin have debated on the minority side. Representative
Lewis has debated. The last person to debate this bill before we take a
vote will be Representative Szoka. Representative Szoka is recognized to
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you,Mr. Speaker. Tax reform has been talked about a heckuva long
time. Before I was elected to this body, I talked about tax reform a
lot. I looked at it. I talked to my Representatives, Senators. I asked
what could be done? A lot could be done, but nothing was done. Today you
have before you a bill that is going to do something. I’m not going to
go into the details because we’ve debated those well enough. But here’s
the effects of this bill. House Bill 998 promotes a healthy economy. It
recognizes that hard work is rewarded by people at all income levels. At
the end of the day it’s the hardworking taxpayers of North Carolina that
are going to have more money in their pockets to spend on things they
want to spend it on, not on things that we want to spend it on. And
that’s only right. This bill sends a clear, clear message to businesses,
not only in North Carolina, but across the nation and throughout the
globe.</p>

That we value the businesses that are already here, and we welcome
businesses to relocate to North Carolina to conduct their business here.
As has been stated many times, tax reform is not an event, it's a
process. This is an awesome start to this process, building on the work
of many others who worked very hard and have fought this out to a great
extent. This is a plan of action that respects all of our citizens, and
I ask you to vote for this bill.

pushes out the effective date two weeks. We were afraid that when it,
once it got to the Governor and got signed that they wouldn't have time

time to get their stuff going, so we just pushed it out two weeks. I ask

Ladies and gentlemen of the house, for your planning purposes this
week,tomorrow we will have a no-vote session. We will come in probably
around 10:00. Without any objection, the appropriations committee will
commence its meetings, and I'm sure there will be a notice on there from
Representative Dollar during notices and announcements. On Wednesday,
there will be a finance committee meeting. The chair anticipates that
the appropriations bill will be voted out of appropriations tomorrow,
and will be referred to finance for consideration at 8:30 AM on
Wednesday morning. The chair anticipates that that vote out of finance
will occur some time around 9:50 or 10:00 AM on Wednesday morning, and
then it will be reported into the floor. We will begin the debate on the
appropriations bill on Wednesday, session will be at noon. The intent of
the chair is to allow all amendments that are in order to be heard, and
all the debates that members wish to have to occur. Depending upon how
long that goes, let's say that goes until 10:30 or 11:00, then the chair
will confer with the minority and determine whether or not they would
prefer to go ahead and take their meeting after midnight, and allow
everyone to be gone on Thursday, but that will be with complete
concurrence for the minority. Otherwise, we would come back on Thursday,
probably around 9:30 or 10:00 to take up their reading. So, we will wait
and see. On the other hand, if we finish the debate at 7:00 on Wednesday
evening, I would just assume, let everyone go home. We would come back
early. The primary goal for doing that is to provide the staff with some
much needed rest before they have to turn around and deal with
conferencing the following week. But if anyone has any objections to
potentially taking that up, based on how the debate goes on Wednesday,
we will go to a Thursday session. Notices and announcements.
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just have a question. You indicated the
amendments that would be in order, are we going to be able to hear all
of the amendments that are offered, and is there a restriction on the
time frame in which they have to be submitted to be reviewed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, I do believe that Representative Dollar may bring
that up. That is a part of the process. And notices and announcements, a
gentleman may state an inquiry at the appropriate time if your question
has not been answered. Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Knowing a Personal Privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The house will come to order. The gentleman is recognized for a point of
Personal Privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House. My brief statement is on
any bill and applies to every member, including myself: if a member is
arguing a bill, and asserting that there are specific things in a bill,
that member ought to be able to yield, where, line and page number, that
particular provision in a bill is located.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is noticed for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Full appropriations will begin our deliberations of the budget bill, at
8:30, tomorrow morning in room 633. I would ask that you be sure to
bring your budget documents with you, bring your money report, and bring
your budget bill. They were supposed to be brought around to your
offices today. Be sure to bring those with you because we're not going
to have 90-some extra copies sitting up at the desk. We'll send you back
to your office to get them. The main thing I would point out, we will of
course have the rules of the committee, which we generally track the
rules as laid out and adopted by the House, in terms of what is in
order, and they will be making rulings accordingly. We need for you to
make sure that you have any request for having an amendment drafted into
the bill staff dressers by noon. You have to have them in by noon in
order to be put in the hopper for consideration. They may not be
completed, in terms of being drafted by noon, but they have to be into
the folks who do the address by noon. We have talked about the
procedure.</p>
