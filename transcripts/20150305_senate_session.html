  Senate will come to order. Sergeant at Arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery please
silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the
Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. Members and guests in the
gallery please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s pray. Lord, sometimes we
just need to look at scripture because words that we have don’t express
the depth of your heart, so we come and we read Psalms 71. The God from
our youth you have taught us. You still proclaim your wondrous deeds, so
even to old age and grey hairs, oh God, do not forsake me, and so I
proclaim your might to another generation. Your power to all those to
come. Your righteousness, oh God, reaches the high heavens. You have
done great things, oh God. Who is like you? You who have made me see
many troubles and calamities and revived me again in the depths of the
earth, you who bring me up again. And so we pray these things over this
body in the name of Jesus. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President,
the journal of Wednesday, March 4, 2015 has been examined and is found
to be correct. I move that the Senate dispense with the reading of the
journal and that it stand approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without
objection the journal for March 4th stands approved as written. Senators
we have leaves of absence granted today for Senators Curtis and Tucker
and we do have a nurse of the day with us today. Our nurse is Sharonda
Boykin of Fayeteville, NC. Nurse Boykin, if you’ll stand and be
recognized. We thank you for serving the Senate today. [applause]
Senators, by the motion of Senator Chad Barefoot of Wake County, the
Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to the North
Carolina school counselors. If you’re with us today please stand and be
recognized. Thanks for joining us. [applause] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of personal privilege out of order
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, you have the floor for a
moment of personal privilege out of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
sir. These school counselors up here I found out today with a nice visit
from them, three of them have been recognized as counselor of the year.
The counselors have been to the White House, have been to the gala and
the ball and are nationally recognized, so I would like for those three
to stand again, Mr. President, with your permission. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please do, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There they are. North Carolina has
three. [applause] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. I’ll take us
right in to our calendar for today. We have two items on our calendar,
public bills. Senate Bill 37, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 37, Waive tuition fallen officer with guardian. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Smith is recognized to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. This bill is essentially a technical
correction from a bill previously passed by the General Assembly, GS 115
B2 which provides that free tuition at the colleges and the university
system or community colleges for any police officer or firefighter or
rescue personnel that was killed in the line of duty. To give you a
little background for why this bill, a couple of years ago in Lumberton,
a Lumberton Police Officer Jeremiah Goodson was shot and killed in the
line of duty. A tragic event, devastating to the community. At the time
he was killed, he and his wife were raising a child that they had
custodial

  Guardianship for. It was actually his wife’s cousin’s child who had
decided for some reason she could no longer raise her child. The
Goodson’s stepped in to take this child as their own, got a court
ordered custodial guardianship and were raising this son as their own
child. Last year the child graduated from high school and applied for
college, was admitted and was trying to get free tuition under this bill
and was turned down because it says in the original bill parent, it did
not allow for a legal guardian or a custodial guardian, and that is why
I’m asking that you support this bill to help not only Officer Goodson’s
child but any future situation that might arise like this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the good Senator a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Smith, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn’t want you to get
away this quick and this easy on the first bill out of Education. I’ve
got all mine still bottled up with Senator Apodaca. The first bill, not
only to be heard by the Education Committee, but to be passed by members
of the democratic party. I am tired of hearing Stein and. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Tillman, do you have a question for Senator Smith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do, sir, and I’m going to get to it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Tillman, get to your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Some
questions are so good you’ve got to preliminary them. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to know how it feels to be a member of the minority party to have
the first bill heard and passed, will pass, by this body. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It feels wonderful and I certainly appreciate that if everybody
will pass it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That shows you what can be done. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca
for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I really want to thank Senator Smith for bringing
forward this good legislation and maybe when she has the time she can
work with Senator Tillman to show him what good legislation looks like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any discussion or debate? Any discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of
the Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 37 on its second reading. All in
favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Bryant, Bryant, aye.
Hise, aye. Lee, aye. Bryant was aye. 48 having voted in the affirmative
and 0 in the negative, the Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 37 passes
its second reading and without objection will be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The North Carolina General Assembly Enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate. Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage of Committee Substitute to Senate Bill
37 on its third reading. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The ayes have it. Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 37 passes its third reading and will be sent
to the House. We have one bill on our calendar for concurrence, Senate
Bill 14, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 14. Academic
standards, rules review, coal ash funds. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown
is recognized to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. As you may expect, the House has sent this bill back to us
with a few changes. I’ll just briefly touch on them. The House deleted
the provision funding the defense of the Rules Review Commission on the
grounds that the lawsuit is all but resolved and that’s not necessarily
the case, so we have a problem there. Also the House changed the sources
of funds that the State Board of Education can draw on to fund the
$275,000 needed for the Academic Standard Commission. There’s a
provision on the Dam Safety provision that I think we all can agree
with. The House made a change to the composition of the Economic
Development Partnership Board I think we all can live with. There’s a
provision that the House included that has a solution to the Health
Information Exchange Funding that needs some work, I think, in our
opinion, and finally the House added a requirement that the state
auditor to conduct a performance audit of County Department of Social
Services on Medicaid eligibility that there’s some question about as
well, so because of a few problems I would ask that you not concur so we
can continue to work on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stine, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Brown
would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, thank
you for that explanation. What was your opinion of the changes that they
made on the Dam provisions

  since the action planned does seem like constructive. . .
SPEAKER CHANGES
They all--we agree with those, I think we&#39;re okay with those.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Any further discussion or debate? Senator Waddell, for what purpose do
you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To speak to the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Waddell has the floor to speak to the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I just want to clarify some points that are in the bill. This can be a
bad bill or it can be a good bill. I previously voted no because I did
not think that any money should be taken from the Department of Public
Instruction in any way, shape, or form. I have a 30-year career in
education and I understand the financial needs of the Department of
Public Instruction. I believe the funding cut would deter the Department
of Public Instruction from accomplishing its mission of providing
educational services to teachers, students, and administrators. Further,
in this piece of legislation, we&#39;re dealing with a lot of
things--academic standards review commission expenses, the Economic
Development Partnership Board, co-ash  management appropriations,
clarification of engineers, and the extension of emergency action plans
for dams not associated with co-ash residuals surface empowerment. A lot
of things in one bill. Also, the bill requires a performance audit by
the state auditor of Medicaid eligibility determination by counties. I
want to know is this economically feasible to provide the most accurate
determination of the counties&#39; performance with Medicaid. And
further, when we want to think about that, we want to make sure that we
are not setting up something to prevent people from wanting to apply for
Medicaid. In addition, the bill makes the $2 million appropriation for
DHHS for health information exchange non-occurring. If we continue to
reduce funding in DHHS, it may become nonfunctional. So those are some
concerns that I have about the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Do we have any further discussion or debate? Senator Tillman, for what
purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To speak on the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Tillman has the floor to speak to the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I don&#39;t know much more important work than setting an academic
standards review commission to make our standards the best in the
nation. I don&#39;t know a more appropriate place to take it than DPI.
Now before you totally fall in love with DPI, I will remind you
they&#39;ve got hundreds of employees over there; average salary of
$78,000 a year. We&#39;ve got teachers of average salary of just a
little better than $40,000 a year. The DPI people, as far as I know,
don&#39;t teach a single child, and all of our thousands of teachers,
they teach children every day. We didn&#39;t want to take it from the
classroom, and if you&#39;ve got a better idea of where we ought to take
it, you ought to try to get it in the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To speak on the motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Senator.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. President. Folks, this is a motion to concur. We&#39;re
all going to have time to talk about the finished product when it comes
out.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Senator.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I&#39;d like to get home sometime today. Thank you, Mr. President.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Senator. We do have a motion before us, and the motion before
us from Senator Brown is that we do not concur in the House Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 14. So the question for the Senate is the
motion to concur in House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 14.
We&#39;ll have one electronic vote. All in favor will vote aye, opposed
will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk
will record the vote. Smith Ingram. Smith Ingram Waddell. No, Waddell.
Up or down thumb, Waddell? No? One having voted in the affirmative and
47 having voted in the negative, the Senate does not concur in the House
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 14, and the House will be so
notified. Senators, that does conclude our calendar for the day.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. President?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To make an announcement.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Rucho, you have the floor for an announcement.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you. Members of the Senate, we will have a Senate redistricting
committee meeting today at one o&#39;clock in 643 of the LOB. We will be
discussing Senate Bill 36, Greensboro City Council changes. We will
discuss Senate Bill 181, Wade County Commission districts. There will be
no vote today. This is strictly informational, and

meeting. We’ll have a two minute limit and we will have an orderly

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Forgive me for asking to speak a second time on the
personal privilege motion but we have a birthday, Mr. President, if you
would allow me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I passed by Senator Gunn’s office 3 or 4 times this morning.
No, I didn’t forget it. He was at the mirror, you know, he’s proud of
his hair. His birthday is today and if I had, he’s almost caught up with
me in age, but if I had hair like that I’d look as young as you do, but
happy birthday Senator Gunn, Alamance and Randolph. [applause] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do we have any other notices or announcements? Any other
notices or announcements? Any further business to come before the
Senate? If not, the chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do
now adjourn subject to the standard stipulations set forth in Senate
rule 24.1, the receipt of committee reports, appointment of conferees
and messages from the House to reconvene on Monday, March 9, 2015 at
7PM. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn
subject to the stipulations stated by Senator Berger to reconvene
Monday, March 9th at 7PM. Seconded by Senator Jackson. All in favor say
aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it. Senate stands adjourned.
