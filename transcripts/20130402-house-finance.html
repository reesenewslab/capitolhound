The house committee on finance will come to order, members please take
your seats. As always we'd like to extend our gratitude to the pagers
who are here to assist us today. If you will, please raise your hand.
Lexi All from Johnson county, Lauren Cocker from Wake County, Carson
Ellerby from Wake County, Brandon Falls from Culikulah County. Thank you
very much for being with us today and of course we acknowledge the
assistance of our House Sergeant of Arms Fred Heigns, Regi Seals, John
Brandon, Mike Clampett and finally, don't think i've said enough but we
appreciate the support from our staff. Ladies and Gentlemen the first
bill on the agenda is House bill 224. The chair has been informed there
is proposed committee substitute for House Bill 224. The Sergeant of
Arms will, if not done so already, distribute the VCS for house bill
224. Representative Setzer moves that the proposed committee substitute
for house bill 224 be before the committee for discussion. Without
objection it is so ordered and Representative Moffitt and Representative
Ramsey are recognized to explain House Bill 224. Representative Moffit
you have the floor.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr.Chair. Good morning members of the committee. Can everyone
hear me ok? Alright. This bill is fairly straightforward. This is
removing the ETJ authority from the city of Asheville. For those of you
not familiar with Buncombe County, it's one of the counties in the state
that provides for county wide zoning. So we have a jurisdictional
overlay issue here so removing the ETJ authority is really not that big
of a deal. In talking with the city as well as the county, the original
bill provided a 60 day transition period, the county felt that was not
sufficient amount of time so we moved that to 120 days. This does allow
for voluntary annexation but it also provides for the county appointment
authority to planning and zoning and board of adjustment to remain as it
is currently. And I'll be glad to answer any questions.
[speaker changes]
Representative Warren please state your purpose
[speaker changes]
For a motion at the appropriate time sir.
[speaker changes]
The general will be so recognized. Is there any other member seeking
recognition. Representative Davis please state your purpose
[speaker changes]
To ask a question
[speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to propose an inquiry.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr.Chairman. If I can ask, when someone wants to voluntary
annex will the people in that area get to vote on whether that
annexation takes place?
[speaker changes]
The general is recognized
[speaker changes]
Thank you Representative Davis. The voluntary annexation statutes are
currently unchanged so whatever path they have to move on in order to be
voluntarily annexed, I believe 60% of the property owners have to agree
and they can do that through a petition process.
[speaker changes]
Representative Holley please state your purpose
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr.Chairman. I have a question.
[speaker changes]
The lady is recognized to propose an inquiry.
[speaker changes]
The city of Asheville agrees with this? Are they in concurrence with
this about taking away the ETJ? Or is there any opposition to this bill?
[speaker changes]
Thank you Representative Holly. I notified the city on January 2nd that
this legislation is coming. They did take the initiative to go ahead and
start working with the county in regards to rolling back the ETJ and
working on a transition. This just expedites the process.
[speaker changes]
Are there any further members seeking recognition if not Representative
Warren you are recognized for a motion.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr.Chair. I'd like to make a motion that we make a favorable
report to the proposed committee substitute for House Bill 224,
Unfavorable to the original.
[speaker changes]
Representative Warren has moved that the proposed committee substitute
for House Bill 224 be given a favorable report and that an unfavorable
report be given to the original bill. Further discussion or debate.
Seeing none. Those who favor the motion will please signify by saying
&quot;Aye&quot;. Those who oppose will signify by saying &quot;No&quot;.
In the opinion of the chair the Ayes have it and the motion carries, the
bill will be given a favorable</p>

Will be given a favorable report. House bill 252, there's a proposed
committee substitute for this bill. If it's not been done so, the chair
directs the sergeant in arms to distribute the proposed committee
substitute at this time. Representative Schaffer moves that the proposed
committee substitute be before the committee for discussion purposes.
Seeing no objection, it is so ordered, and the proposed committee
substitute for House bill 252 is before the committee for discussion
purposes. Representative Moffitt is recognized to explain the bill. You
have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Members of the committee, this bill actually
repeals session law 2009-114, which permitted the city of Asheville to
take 5% of the gross revenues from the public enterprise water system
that they operate and repurpose those dollars towards sidewalk and
street improvement, as long as it's associated with a water related
project. And that's about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Moffitt will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to pose his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Representative Moffitt, can you tell the
committee, first of all, how does the city of Asheville feel about this
legislation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Luebke. I would like to recognize Vice Mayor
Esther Manheimer from the city of Asheville is here. She would like to
speak in opposition to the bill. Also would like to recognize Ms. Lauren
Bradley. She's the Chief Financial Officer from the city of Asheville.
She had made the trip last week as well. And we also have in the
audience the Mayor of Mills River, who's here, I guess as a spectator,
which is Mayor Roger Snyder. Mister chair, if we could recognize Vice
Mayor Esther Manheimer to speak in opposition to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair, that'd be fine with me. It'd be a good idea actually, I
think, but I would like to reserve my right to comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, we'll return to the gentleman. Without objection, at this time,
we will temporarily leave the committee discussion and invite our guest
from Asheville to speak. If the first of the speakers will please
approach the mic. The sergeant in arms would please turn the mic on. If
you would ma'am, please state your name and your title for the record.
And you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. My name is Esther Manheimer. I'm the Vice
Mayor of the city of Asheville. Members of the committee, thank you.
It's my honor to be able to address you this morning and I thank you for
this opportunity to speak. I am here with Lauren Bradley, our chief
financial officer, who is also prepared to make remarks. And of course,
Mr. Roger Snyder, the Mayor of Mills River who lives in, whose town is
in Northern Henderson county and whose sewer system is part of the King
Creek system which is the subject of House bill 488 which is not before
you this morning. House bill 252 impacts the 5% of revenue that the city
of Asheville is allowed to use for, essentially transportation or
infrastructure improvements and that amounts to between 1.65 million to
1.9 million a year in capital investment. I want to talk about the
broader issue for the Asheville regional area and the impact of this
bill. But let me give you some context. From January 2012 to January
2013, the Asheville metro area led the state with 3.6% in job growth and
in that time Asheville had the third largest share of the state's
employment growth, 10.3%. We brought in New Belgium, a huge beer
manufacturing company</p>

…Which replaced the Volvo Company who left and these companies I have
talked to these companies they came to Ashville because they like
Ashville, their employees wanna live there, they wanna enjoy the
mountains and they were looking for not just anyplace to locate their
company. In other words, Ashville is doing pretty well even though we
have a restrained budget, we don’t enjoy some of the tax bases so the
other cities enjoy such as the food and beverage tax or the hotel tax
which might be typical for tours town like Ashville but we operate well
within our means on a restrictive budget without that tax base. Turning
to the bill before you, this is a local bill off course that was put in
place in 2009 by Ashville’s Delegation, well actually really Bunkum
County, Representative and Senators at that time and the reason it was
put in place is because Sullivan Acts 2 and 3 were enact and believe it
was in 2005 which change the way Ashville could operate it’s water
system to make it different in the way other cities can operate their
water system. Number one, Ashville cannot charge differential rates,
other cities by statue or allowed to charge different rates for
customers inside versus outside. Number two, Ashville cannot require
annexation of developers that develop subdivisions on the outskirts of
the city but tap on to the water system. Again, that’s different than
other cities, other cities can say, “Okay, you wanna build your
subdivision, you wanna tap into our water system. Well, you gotta come
into the city.” This money is used for improvements such as the
following: It’s only been in place since 2009 and you can’t just turn
around and do a capital project the next day. So, we have done a lot of
planning and the money right now that we have accumulated will be used
for we call the ‘Azalea Road Project’ which leads to a whole bunch of
soccer fields. There is only one road to get out there and 5,000 moms
including me get in their main events and drive out there every Saturday
so we can watch our kids play soccer. And the road is terrible and it
runs along a creek and it needs massive improvement and it’s a costly
project but it benefits the whole region because I will tell you moms
and dads from all over the place come to these soccer fields every
Saturday. So, this project will also provide storm mitigation, it’s
going to do improvements to a river that runs in that area that will
stop or hopefully greatly mitigate the flooding that occurs down in the
Biltmore village area, some of you might be familiar with it’s right
outside the entrance to the famous Biltmore House, there are lots of
shops and restaurants down there and you might have seen footage from
the hurricane where the whole area flooded. So, this is an example to
great project we have brought in other revenue sources as well, we felt
like we have done a good blend for a good project and that’s the kind of
thing we are using this money for. As a city, we are trying to make
investments that set the stage or compliment future private investment
in Ashville which means jobs and job growth and economic development and
this bill affects our ability to do that, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mam. Representative Moffitt you are recognized, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from Vice Mayor
Manheimer, I would like to point out for the committee the Sullivan Acts
of 2005 and 2006 were really 2 and 3 regarding Sullivan Acts, the
initial Sullivan Act was passed in 1933 because the water system within
the city of Ashville and Bunkum County is more unique than any other
system throughout the entire state. I don’t wanna go through the history
but there is a vast history in regards to this being a public water
utility that’s operated by the city. It is been recognized by the
Supreme Court or by the Appellate Court that this is a community system
not the system for the purpose of the city of Ashville to use anyway
they choose to. The 5% allowable use in 2009 essentially circumvented
the Sullivan Act of 1933, this is a different way to impose differential
water rates on people outside of the city of Ashville so the city can
repurpose those dollars in a manner that they feel is consistent with
2009-114 and I disagree the project that Vice Mayor Manheimer mentioned
has a $189,000 price tag to…

…improvements but it has an over two million dollar price tag for road
improvement and I just don’t think in the spirit of that session law
that those types of differences between the water line cost and the
ancillary improvement outside of that should be that significantly
different and lastly this is a public policy issue and I discuss this in
the committee on government, we as a body the General Assembly have
significant responsibilities to all of our tax payers state wide, should
we allow cities to take monies from the public enterprises that they are
essentially charged with oversize repurpose those monies but at the same
time floating revenue bonds, putting the public enterprises into that
and failing to meet their CIP requirements because they are taking
dollars away from the public enterprise. I would say that is not a good
public policy and this is what this repeal means. Mr. Chairman I’m open
for any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luke please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Continuing, thank you Representative Moffitt for having ___[01:06] from
city speak. I guess this is a question for Ms. Griffin for staff, the
Vice Mayor indicated that Ashville can may not charge double the way
Durham does for those areas outside of the city limits that use city
water. Why is that the case? Why it seems unfair to the city having made
those investments and not getting city property taxes? Can you tell me
why Ashville’s situation is different from Durham’s?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luke I’m gonna look and we have got a guest staff here
today because the primary staff person who is handling this bill is out
today but Erica ___[01:46] is here and she might be able to show some
light on your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman I believe the answer that Representative Luke in the
original 2005 session law where Ashville was restricted and what it
could charge users outside of its system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A follow up for Ms. Erica ___[02:04]. So, you are saying that unless
there is a specific provision part which happen in the Ashville Area, it
is okay for cities that Durham does, it’s okay except when you get a
provision such as the 2005.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir, the general law would allow for a desperate charge between in
the jurisdiction and outside of the jurisdiction but Ashville has been
restricted by session law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative Moffitt once you dive into fight and I do not
understand this exactly? If you could, you kind of have to explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Luke, could you expand on your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the phrase dive into fight, why and I don’t mean the impolite but
medaling, I mean this is a policy the city of Ashville has, the Vice
Mayor has talked about how it’s directly related economic development,
they are public services, water supply, it’s basically all related to
infrastructure. So, I guess my question is, why wouldn’t you keep going
dogs, let sleeping dogs like, I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I think I can handle it, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to bark.
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Probably my bite is worst than my bark but…
[Laughter]
…But the real fact here is that this goes back 80 or 90 years where the
public water utility which is operated by the city as unlike any other
water utility in the state and it was so recognized that differences
were so recognized that in 1933 Representative Billy Sullivan pass the
Sullivan Act, which basically protected the interest of people outside
of the corporate limits of Ashville recognizing the fact that the county
tax payers and the county residents were very involved in the
development of a water system as noted 1927 of House Bill 894 which was
passed by this General Assembly authorize in the county of Bunkum to
develop a water system. Short time later, House Bill 892 was adopted
which allow the city of Ashville and the county of Bunkum to jointly
develop water system. So, we have got this rich history but the simple
fact is the Sullivan Act protected folks outside the county from the
overreach of the folks in the city and using water for strategic
purposes and charging differential water rates.

<p id="20:00">
House Bill 252 essentially is an end run of that history. And it allows
the city to take 5% of this public enterprise, re-purpose those dollars,
and use them for city related projects. Does that answer the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I might, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. About 90% I’m going to try to stop thinking about dogs, even though
I started it. I would say, members of the committee, when the city comes
down here and tells us that things are just fine with this, that it’s
facilitating economic development in the area. I truly don’t see why we
have this bill. Cities are important engines of economic development, we
all know that. It seems like a relatively minor transfer of funds
towards a specific purpose that the city can currently do, and so,
members, I’m going to vote against the bill, and I hope you would to.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For a motion at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recognized accordingly. Representative Ross of
Wake, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of Miss Churchill and then to ask a question to the
bill’s sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady may pose her inquiries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Churchill, are there any other statutes that restrict cities in the
way that this statute proposes to restrict cities? I understand that
there’s generally…cities are allowed to do what Asheville’s been doing,
but has the General Assembly ever come in and put a similar restriction
on. And I apologize if that was discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, I think what you’re asking, are there any other
local acts of a similar nature? I’m not aware of any off the top of my
head, but I’ll be glad to look. There are multiple times where the
General Assembly, through a local act, will tell a city they cannot do
something or they specifically can do something.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. When you look, could you see whether there’s any that have to
do with water resources or infrastructure in this particular way. I know
that we do things for cities, but I’d like to know about that. And, Mr.
Chairman, for the bill sponsors, two questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am. You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do either of the bill’s sponsors know of similar local acts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Ross. I’m not aware of similar local acts. Nor
am I aware of any other area in the state that has the same history
regarding water as we do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And a follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this 5% that you no longer want to go for these projects. These
projects all have to be water related, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a comment, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It just seems to me that since there’s a nexus
between what the money is being used for and the water system, that this
isn’t the kind of abuses that we’ve heard of where people take revenues
from some kind of infrastructure project and then use it for something
wholly unrelated or to supplant tax dollars. This seems to be directly
related and directly related to the consumers of the water system. It
not only seems...it seems to be what goes on around the state, but it
seems to be entirely proper and it’s already limited in its amount. I’m
having a really hard time understanding how this is an abuse of local
control.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Ramsey, did you wish to address that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, I think what we’re missing is, Representative
Moffitt had indicated, the unique history of this system. The reality is
the city of Asheville operates a system that is not entirely owned by
the city of Asheville. It’d be just like Wake County. If Wake County,
over the years, had invested tens of millions of dollars into a water
system. It was a joint system. The courts in North Carolina had
determined that it was a joint system from that regard. This General
Assembly in 2005 thought it was good policy that all their water
revenues would be reinvested into the system because of the history of
Asheville and Buncombe County. We have one of the highest water leakage
rates of any community in the state because we have a very old system.
And partly that’s because of trying to dig ourselves out of the Great
Depression. Water funds were diverted...</p>

<p id="25:00">
for other purposes to pay off debts and other things. I think from a
long term policy standpoint, it does make sense that the water revenues
are reinvested in the water system to repair lines and to avoid leakages
and other things. I think city council will stipulate, in a perfect
world, that would be the world they would like to live in. What we’re
doing with the 5% is really a local issue that the city would like other
revenues to help offset a decision the city made in 2005 to terminate a
water agreement that they had with Buncombe County that cost the city
around $3 million. That wasn’t the General Assembly’s decision to
terminate that water agreement. It wasn’t the county’s decision to
terminate the water agreement. If the city would so choose, the city
could re-enter negotiations with Buncombe County and reconstitute that
water agreement to deal with some of the tax equity issues that the city
is concerned about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a final comment. Well, it appears to me that this is kind of
payback for that. The 5% is still going to water related infrastructure
and so it seems to me like this is just payback.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The 5% is going to water related in regards to streets and sidewalks,
not in regards to the water distribution system itself. I think that
that’s a decision that we as policy makers need to make. If you’re
looking at repairing and patching roads and sidewalks from the cuts that
have to happen when you’re upgrading the system, that’s one cost. Those
are already directly billed to the system. But these are loosely
connected improvements that are being associated to a waterline
improvement and it’s just from this policy maker’s perspective, just not
good policy. Water revenues need to stay in the system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just have a couple of questions I’d like to ask.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for inquiries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I understand from what you and Representative Ramsey have said
that this is a system that was not built completely by the city of
Asheville. There’s been a lot of investment by the county as well as the
city. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The second question I have is that if this bill passes, I think from
what I heard you say, things like leaking pipes and that kind of things
and even cuts to streets and all will still be able to be repaired by
money that’s in this enterprise fund. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And my third question and final one, if I may, Mr. Chairman. I’m having
a hard time understanding how a road to a soccer field is somehow
related to a water system. Could you explain that to me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s a good question. This is a project, and I’m a soccer dad and a
soccer coach and I’ve been down Azalia Road many, many times wishing
that the road would be improved. The city has taken the opportunity to
take these dollars and accumulate them in a separate fund to work on
this road project and as I mentioned earlier in my comments, the water
line extensions to the field house are $189,000. The road construction
is over $2 million. That’s a huge differential between a waterline
improvement project and what would be considered an improvement. This is
an entirely new that’s going to be constructed. I think that….this bill
does not affect that road, does not affect that project. This is
prospective dollars that the city has taken under this particular
permissible local act. They’ll be able to retain and this becomes
effective at the end of their fiscal which is June 30th.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just make one comment and I’ll be done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As one who’s lived in an area that suffered from diversion of electric
utility funds to other purposes for a long time by my city and other
cities in our area, I understand where you’re coming from. We were
already paying extremely high electric rates and you add that surcharge
on there that they’re diverting and it makes it even worse. Fortunately,
in our case, just shining the light of day on it once the press began to
cover it very well, those cities began to drop their diversions down due
to public backlash. Of course, eventually we codified that last year,
most of you remember in the electric cities groups, how they can’t
continue to divert...</p>

Representative Moffitt, am I correct that, this is a Buncombe county
water system, for which Buncombe county has paid over 37 million dollars
to the city of Asheville? And this 5% is just an ongoing offer to the
city of Asheville that just because the water system is being kind to
the city of Asheville.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Representative R. Brawley. I would say mostly correct.
[speaker changes]
Representative Brawley of Mecklenburg please state your purpose
[speaker changes]
To debate the bill
[speaker changes]
The gentleman may speak on the bill
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr.Chairman. Representative collins made a reference to a bill
earlier with electro cities which were diverting money rather than
paying off the debt for their generation capacity, so they're now having
rates that are significantly higher than the surrounding territory
because they actually owe more for the generation capacity then when it
was built, while progress energy, which own the rest of the capacity had
completely paid off their debt at which divergence of funds was for
other purposes. We had severe difficulty with water and sewer along the
union county Mecklenburg line because the union/county system which was
built with property tax money originally, was used as a source of funds
to reduce property taxes in union county. So we ended up with a
situation where homes on sewer lines could not connect because it was
not sewer treatment capacity. Homes on water lines could not connect
because there was not water production capacity. And Union county,
rather than accepting what they had done tried to put in adequate public
facilities ordinances or impact fees which were overturned by the court
and they're still continuing to work that their way out. Mecklenburg
county has a utility that does not operate differential rates. The
shrawley Mecklenburg utility department was formed by the merger of
several water utilities within Mecklenburg County, they are agnostic as
to which town in which you are located, they give water service
regardless. It's primarily based on need, the rates are the same. It is
a completely a revenue based system and does contract for some service
with the city of Charlotte, for personnel and some management but does
not divert money into other projects. Now, representative Ramsey shared
an email with me which came from Gary Jackson with the Asheville NC
government and it listed off some of the information: The 5% fee which
Asheville collects to be used for whatever purposes but that is in
addition to service fees which Asheville charges for things like city
mangers time, personell service and what have you. And as one who has a
tendency to kinda run the math I figured out that roughly 10.83% of
water revenue is going to the city of Asheville. Either for services
that Asheville provides or for uses as described earlier today: Water
related street improvements. That makes good sense except when you think
about &quot;we've got a 2 million dollar road with a 200 thousand dollar
water system improvement.&quot; It's almost as if there's a way to, I
don't know if you want to call it launder money, but to use money from
water revenues for things that don't produce more water. And I think
that's an issue that's what we're really discussing today. Charlotte
Mecklenburg Utilities was formed with interlocal agreements that
required rates that be the same, service be the same. When Charlotte
took over water utilities that had been built by other towns or by
Mecklenburg county, apparently we didn't have the same kind of contract
protections here, it was what was done, but to come back now and say
&quot;Look, if you've got a water utility that was created out of county
water systems, town water systems, city water systems, you just have to
be agnostic.</p>

it's not something that you get an extra premium to use within your
corporate borders to lower your property tax rate, then turn to the
other towns and say, &quot;Tax your people to build your roads.  We're
going to build some roads up here.&quot;  I appreciate the benefits of
economic growth.  I can not believe a corporation would relocate to
Asheville because a two million dollar road improvement to a soccer
field made Asheville just irresistable.  I intend to support this bill.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Representative.
Representative Alexander of Mecklenburg, please state your purpose.
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And just to comment on some of the comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  I think the point that I was making and I
think Representative Ross was making, is that these are infrastructure
improvements that are in current legislation, that what Representatives
Moffitt and Ramsey are trying to do in this bill essentially is deny the
city a right to invest in and around infrastructure issues.  Whether the
soccer field is the best use of the money is a decision the city council
made and the voters of the city of Asheville can decide by throwing the
bums out or keeping them in the next municipal election.  It seems to me
what we're doing here is meddling in that kind of process.  If people in
the city don't like the soccer field, or the expenditure of that much
money for the road to the soccer field, then they'll vote those people
out who made that choice.  And that's how it's supposed to work.  And
what's happening here is that we once again, with this bill, are doing
what the majority seems committed to do, which is restrict once again
local control.  And I think then, the biggest difference between
infrastructure projects which a city may currently do and which will be
prohibited in the future under this legislation, and what Representative
Brawley I think and Collins have said, is that this is not about cities
not doing the job with electors' cities' revenue and using it to play
with property tax.  I understand what each of you was talking about, and
I agree that that was wrong.  But that's not what this is about.  This
is about infrastructure-related issues, and I think it's really
different from the elector cities' situation.  So again, I think this is
meddling, and I hope people will, hope at least a few of us will vote
against the bill, thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman, would
Representative Luebke yield for a question about his comment?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  I will.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  He does yield.  The gentleman may
state his inquiry.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Luebke, people in
south Buncombe County that are not within the city of Asheville, people
outside the city of Asheville to the west, the north, the east, people
in Henderson County, who are paying for that two million dollar road to
a soccer field.  How do they vote the bums out, on the Asheville city
council?  Because the Asheville city council is the one that's levying
that five percent and then spending it for the benefit of the citizens
of Asheville.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chair, and I was about to call you
Mr. Speaker, and if you'd like that, I think it's ??  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir.  He's much more thin than I am.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr.
Chairman, if I may reply.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, sir, you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think the difference is that as staff ?? Churchill
indicated, virtually anywhere in the state, the city can charge double
for those who are outside the city limits.  And in Durham, those people
live in Durham County.  Do not pay city taxes, they pay double to the
city for their water supply, their water/sewer.  And they're happy to
have the water/sewer.  So in the Durham case, this city can get the
revenue that it needs.  Now, if somebody out in the county who thinks,
gosh, I don't want to pay double, this is not fair to me, that person
doesn't get a vote on city council.  So I mean, the idea of those who've
invested, the city having control of a water system, and deciding
whether it can or can not charge double, seems to be very, very
reasonable.  Asheville is really restricted.  That seems like an
outlier, and I just don't think we need this bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The Chair recognizes the Bill's sponsor,
Representative Moffitt.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  Representative
Luebke, I appreciate the comparisons to your experiences in Durham, but
the history of the system in our county and in my home town is vastly
different.  And this General Assembly has been actively involved in the
checks and balances of the city and county since the Great Depression.
Secondly, this bill does not prohibit</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Waddell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. For a question to the Vice Mayor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair is going to ask if the Vice Mayor would come forward and then
would yield to one inquiry from the, it appears she, it appears she
does. You may state your, you may state your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, and I'll be brief. I was a former mayor of a
small town and I understand some of those issues about local control.
But my question is, you mentioned in your remarks a while ago that you
did not have an occupancy tax. Is there a reason for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have an occupancy tax but it is not remitted to the city. It is
remitted to the, towards the development authority and the reason is,
it's created by a local bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, mister chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you're saying that your occupancy tax is not revenue for the city but
for the county of, of  Buncombe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it doesn't even go to the county. It goes to the tourism
development authority, which is an independent authority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it does do some, excuse me, mister chairman, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it does do some projects inside of Asheville. It does do some things
inside the town of Asheville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tourism development authorities, it's my understanding are, there's
specific statutes that govern what they can spend their money on. And
they, in our area, our tourism development authority does have some
funds that they can award to projects based on an application process,
and the city participates along with other private companies to apply to
the TDA every year for various projects that we hope to get funded, and
sometimes we do. But there are other cities, of course, many in North
Carolina that actually receive a direct allocation of that hotel/motel
tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Thank you Representative. Representative
Moffitt, did you have something to add to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, thank you mister chair. I would like to add that the soccer field
at the end of Azalea Road has been a topic of discussion, was partially
funded by the TDA, and the city of Asheville just received an $800,000
grant from the TDA for lobby ?? to our civic center, which is the US
Cellular Center.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Mayor, if you will, I believe the lady from Wake wishes to pose an
inquiry of you if you would return to the mic and with that,
Representative Ross, please state your, please state your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much mister chairman and Representative Moffitt. I just
want to know whether, when you expend this 5% of the money, well first
of all, whether you ever get up the maximum of the 5%, and then second,
when you decide to make those expenditures, is it explicit the
connection between those expenditures and the water system? Do you
state, we are expended this amount of money and it is related to water
projects in this way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, those are excellent questions, and I might yield to
our Chief Financial Officer who is here who has that actual information
for you if, with the chair's indulgence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair will indulge. If you will ma'am, please state your name and
your title for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you chair. My name is Lauren Bradley, I work as the chief
financial officer for the city of Asheville, and in response to your
question the answer is yes, that we do distinguish what the projects,
what the money will be used for, that they are used in conjunction for
regional infrastructure projects along with water line construction. So
for example, in Azalea Road, the project that we have talked about here
today, there's been some talk about the cost of the water line versus
the cost of the road. Well, that water line can't be fiscally replaced
in the current roadway infrastructure, so the road infrastructure is
tied to that water line replacement. So they're not usually exclusive.
Another point I would make about Azalea road is there's not potable
water to the soccer fields at this point, and so that the water
component of that project is integral to the facility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am. Do you have additional follow ups, Representative Ross?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My only, well it was the second, I guess the first part of my question,
which is has Asheville ever completely used the entire amount of the 5%,
or are there just discrete projects that go on?</p>

I’m sorry, I missed that part of the question. So, to date, we have

Bill 254 do be before the committee for discussion. Seeing no objection,
it is so order. Representative Glazier, you are recognized to explain
the proposed Committee Substitute for House Bill 254.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you members of the committee. Members,
this is a bill that’s brought by the chair, Representative Lewis,
Representative Szoka, Representative Lucas and myself. It’s on a request
from actually Department of Defense representatives as well as Rule Act
which is the regional land use planning group that combines both
military and non-military institution and entities in our area and also
has equivalent surround Camp Lejeune and other bases. This is a,
actually an amendment, really to a bill that was passed in the early
part of the last decade as part of our BRAC preparation procedures. All
it really does is two major, two minor things really. Number one, it
adds some areas that within five miles of a base, if they are to occur,
the local governmental units are to give notice to the base so that if
the base has any comments about its impact on the military function of
the base, they can let the county commissioners know that before they
vote on it and you’ll see those listed on lines 21 through 26. 21 and 22
are already existing law. This adds any changes relating to
telecommunication towers or windmills or major new subdivision
preliminary plats and any substantial increase in size, more than 50% of
a subdivision’s total land area. All this in relating to any area within
5 miles of the base. The other two changes, one is to allow the
commander of the base who receives the notice of this to designate
someone, in case the commander’s deployed, so we don’t have a notice
problem. And the other is simply to allow, as a request of the home
builders, and I think a correct one, that there be some time frame put
on the military comment time so that if they choose not to comment, it
ends and waves their comment time of 30 days. I know of no opposition at
all. This has been worked out actually with some good amendments by the
homebuilders and unanimously passed the homeland security committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, please state your purpose.

Mr. Chair, at the appropriate time, I’d like to enter a motion.

Representative Glazier, what’s the effect of the change where it says
they can notify them by certified mail and before it had return receipt
requested, but now you can do certified mail, but you just don’t have
the return receipts?

This is to allow any method that’s reasonable...</p>

I understand that and I agree. I was just curious I guess I just have a
lack of understanding, we distract language, return receipt requested, I
just thought certified mail had a return receipt.

I think it was more just that the certified mail has its distinct
meaning and we were adding in other written means reasonably designated.
I actually defer that to stay, I don't view that it changes it. Probably
was language that we always used and don't need anymore.

please, before we being in discussion in House bill 261 the chair would
like to refer the following bill. House bill 205 &quot;correct technical

less than 2 acres of land and this gentlemen is Gary and Anita Moss,
just asked us that they wanted to be in one town or the other their

of Landis and the town of Canapolis is absolutely fine with it and
Landis is fine. The mayors of both towns, city managers and everything.

Thank you Mr. Chairman. A question for the bills sponsor. I did one of
these where I took properties out of the town of Matthews and attached
them to the town of Stalins and I noticed here that we're removing them
from the limits of Canapolis but are we attaching them to Landis?
[speaker changes]
Yes

The bill does not specifically say that but if it needs to we can
certainly check on that and certainly prepare an amendment for the floor
if thats the case.

Mr. Chairman my answer, I think, and being a freshman, I assume because
their is no ETJ in Landis and the town was, the property partially was

Thank you mister chair. On 302 here, this repeals session law 2009-113

was going to be taken in by the city. An agreeable deal here, the whole
nine yards was worked out with water, sewer, none of that has been done
now. The development has not taken place because the new interchange on
the interstate also has not happened, so all parties in agreement here
that this was set to take place this fall, and we want to stop it before
it does, and the city's in agreement, and as well as  the developers,
approximately 750 acres next to I-85.

than this one, this one track?

No. And it's on East and West of I-85.
