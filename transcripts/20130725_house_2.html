[SPEAKER CHANGES] The house will come to order. The gentleman is

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Kristen Dancy was in LA here for I believe for six
years, working this summer, getting her masters at Carnegie Mellon in
violin. For those of you who are interested, after 12 years of
homeschooling she went through Chapel Hill with only one A- . Graduated
first in her class and I’m sorry to lose her.  She has been a great
assistant in my office.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stan, if we were held up to that
academic standards\, I wonder how many members would be in the Chamber
right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is out of order.  Message from the sub,
the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Special message from the Senate.  Mr. Speaker has
ordered the message with Senate with the House of Representatives with
the information in Senate Dobbs report with comp briefs on House Bill
392 a bill in entire act requiring county department of social services
to verify whether an applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for
needy families benefits and food and nutrition benefits is a fleeing
felon or probation or parole violated when the appropriate action has
been taken by both chambers the bill will be ordered in role,

  <p>…time for some of the members of the minority caucus to return to the
chamber. The clerk has advised me we cannot group all the Bills on the
counter and vote them out together.
Mr. Speaker. I was trying to find a way to be very efficient with all
remaining legislation for the day. But…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair has noted the gentleman’s efficiency. House
Bill 392 will be enrolled and sent to the governor.
Counter, Senate Bill 71, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Committee substitute for Senate Bill 71, a Bill
that’s been titled an an act amending the laws regulating irrigation
contractors to  provide substantive requirements for licensing
corporations, to provide for the issuance of licenses to nonresidents,
to clarify the fee structure, and to make other conforming changes. The
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s recognized to debate the bill. The House
will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members this is a bill that has already been through
finance, and I forget, I think it was rules was the other half bill.
Basically this is for irrigation contractors’ licensing. They already
have the license. It allows them to have business entities licensed if
they want to, and they already have someone with an irrigation contract
license. It also puts in a provision so that if someone accidentally
does not meet the continuing ed requirements in time, normally their
license would cease, and they would have to go all the way back through
the re-licensing provision and pay both the re-licensing fee and one
other penalty fee.
So what this does put in place is gives them another 60 days to go and
take those continuing ed classes, and then to pay a flat $300, which is
less than what they’d pay otherwise, or $250, less than what they’d pay
otherwise, so that they can keep their license. It’s basically a way to
help them keep business and moving forward. I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
substitute, the Senate Bill 71 on its second reading. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will allow additional time for the members to return to their
seats. Representative Farmer-Butterfield is they lady’s wish to be
recorded as voting aye. Lady to be recorded as voting aye. The clerk
will ?? the vote. 94 having voted affirmative, 12 in the negative, the
House Committee substitute for Senate Bill 71 has passed the second
reading without objection. It will be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] General Assemble of North Carolina…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
substitute to Senate Bill 71 on its third reading. All in favor say aye.
All opposed no. In the opinion of the chair the ayes have it. The House
Committee substitute for Senate Bill 71 has passed its third reading and
will be returned to the Senate.
The House will come to order. Representative Lucas is recognized for
point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, ‘twas
near the last day of session, as all came to realize that it would not
end until it’s Burrgarized. As session began, we Starnzed and Maloned.
But soon were bombarded by a blust of Stone. So we hopped a trolley to a
Torbett of Burr, with hope of finding a Schaffer of Holley. Soon a good
man Jetered a ray…

Along came a Farmer-Butterfield who lured a Hanes, two Grahams, to

So we consulted Presidents Alexander Hamilton, Harrison, Cleveland,

McNeill, Bryan, Richardson, Hardister, Collins, G. Martin, S. Martin,
Fulghum, Dixon and Jones, to be chaired by Rep Howard, was charged to
state and into this session by a certain date.
But Representative Brandon inquired, “What’s wrong with being late?” So
Lucas, if you think that this session has been long, why be annoyed? It
can be ended with a quick nod to Representative Floyd. Well, it is
ending and soon we’ll be leaving. But not with queries from Reps Glazier
and Stevens. So legislators continue to realize that this session could
not end till it’s Burr-gerized. Thank you.

I was the first one here today on my side and I just want everybody to
know that. But I would also like to see if these comments could be
spread across the journal, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, you have no witnesses on the first matter. And
your point on the second is well taken. We would like to have that
spread across the journal. I think we’ve kind of upped our culture
today, violins and poetry. Now we’re back to the top of the calendar,

  <p>House of Representatives on House Bill 74  ?? to improve and streamline
the regulatory process in order to stimulate job creation to eliminate
unnecessary regulation to make varies other essential changes and to
amend certain environment and natural resources laws the Comfries(??)
recommend the Senate and House of Representatives adopt his report.
Comfries for the Senate, Senator Jackson chair, Senators Brock, Brown
and Wade.  Comfries for the House of Representatives, Representative
Moffitt chair, Representative Murray, Milis and Sanderson
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt please state your purpose
Thank you Mister Speaker I like to make a motion and debate the motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to make the motion and
debate the motion
Thank you Mister Speaker, members I move that the House do adopt the
conference report in regard to House BILL 74 as agreed to with the
Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion
Thank you, members, what you have before you is actually a combination
of two Bills; you have the House Bill 94 which is the Environmental
Amends Bill, returned to us from the Senate quite some time ago.  What
you also have in this Bill is Senate Bill 112 which was the House
regulatory Reform Bill which was cleared in this chamber on July 11 with
a strong bipartisan vote of 84 to 28.  I will be covering the Senate
Bill 112 part of this particular Bill and Representative Samuelson and
Representative McElraft for the remaining parts of House Bill 94 inside
of this Bill.
For the sake of brevity what I will cover is simply the changes that
were made in the conference report regarding Senate Bill 112.  The first
change is in section 6c, page 7, in regards to allowing a student to
have the right to counsel in regards to any quasi-judicial setting on a
college campus.  Essentially what we changed was that by allowing them
to have an attorney it’s not a right, so in the case of that they cannot
afford an attorney then one is not appointed to them at the expense of
the taxpayer.  They can have an advocate, it could be a parent, it could
be a counselor or it could be an attorney but all of that is born at
their expense.
In the second part to that section as we are directing the community
college system and each constituent institution over the next year to
track how this is actually working and to prepare a report for us and
this will be delivered next May on May 1, 2014.
The second change is on page 9, this is regarding the local government
pre-emption part, which received a lot of discussion and debate in this
body on July 11th.  We have removed that entire section and we’ve
replaced it with essentially a study.  We will be studying that aspect
between now and the short session to determine the best course of action
forward.  We have put in its place that any local government enacting
environmental ordinance that ordinance must be adopted unanimously by
the board making that ordinance or it is not affective.  This is a
temporary measure and that will expire next October 1, 2014.
The next change is in section 12, regarding the criminal records checks
regarding childcare providers, we are actually removing this entire
section.  After we had reached an agreement with the Senate we were
informed there are some issues with this and the Technical Corrections
Bill, this entire section will be stripped from statute.
Next change is on page 21, section 19a, and again this is an issue that
was brought forward and discussed on the floor by Representative Carney,
this is regarding carbon monoxide detectors.   Trying to put together
the right solution this is a little more complicated than what we had
anticipated so we have taken a two-step approach to this initially we
have additional language offered by Representative Jordan which will be
in the Technical Corrections Bill.  Essentially its 4 parts we directed
the building code council to adopt rules regarding lodging
establishments to install electrical hard wire carbon monoxide
detectors.  The second part in the interim requires battery operated or
electrical plugin carbon monoxide detectors beginning October 1st.  The
third part is requiring them to be hard-wired October 1, 2014 in moving
forward.  The last part is directing again the building code
((NOTE: I tried to adjust the paragraphs, I hope they do not all run
together, thanks))

  <p>Council and working with the department of health and human services and
the commission for public health to study these requirements because
what we did discover is that the way the language is crafted, it may not
solve the problem that Representative Jordan experienced in his
district. We received a heartfelt letter from the family of the young
boy that died in that particular hotel, and the language as crafted
would not have prevented his death. So with that information being
brought forward, we’re going to fold that into our review between now
and a short session and bring back to this body corrective language that
would have prevented this young man’s death. The next part is actually…
section 60 on page 68 and this is regarding the industrial commission.
This received quite a bit of debate on the floor, and essentially the
agreement with the Senate is that beginning July 1st of 2015, the Deputy
Commissioners will be exempt from the State Personnel Act and
essentially what that means is they are not exempt at this point, and
they will be exempt as of July 1, 2015. We will be looking into this
during the interim for one particular reason. When an employee of the
state, when their compensation is set by statute the question is, is
that person exempt or not exempt? And this extends past just folks that
are at the industrial commission, and we need to look into that issue.
Because a number of their compensations are set by statute or are keying
off of compensation that is set in statute, and that is a question that
we need to investigate and if we need to make changes we will do so in a
short session. Mr. Speaker that concludes the changes regarding senate
bill 112 as presented in house bill 74.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Samuelson is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, it just occurred to me that Representative
Moffitt only had to go over the changes, but since we haven’t voted on
any of this on the 74 portion of it, I’m going to have to go through
various parts of it and I’ll go as quickly as I can, but if you have
questions later feel free to ask me.
Also, there’s one thing that I don’t think I heard Representative
Moffitt mention, but the original language that was in 74 which was the
rules review process that did pass this legislative body is also in
here. So the first section is all that review, rules review language
that we’ve already passed, then the portions that he went over, and then
starting on page 23, we have the new amended environmental laws. And I’m
going to do them by section.
Sections 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 are all air related. The first one, 25,
appeals the model 2008 and subsequent model heavy-duty diesel
requirements. This is basically recognizing that we had some rules out
there that didn’t seem to apply in these vehicular areas and we’re asked
to rem—the environmental ?? commission asked us to move this back, so
they can keep everything standardized.
Section 26 department directs ?? to study whether all of the counties
covered under the ignition testing and maintenance program are needed in
order to maintain propulsion ?? ozone standards. Living in a county that
has to meet these standards, they just want to make sure that we’re
addressing the right counties that need to do this, and I did have them
verify that.
Section 27 provides the EMC with the flexibility to determine whether
rules are necessary for controlling the effects of complex sources on
air quality. This is basically just directing them to look at it and
decide what they need to do.
Section 28 amends the rules in the North Carolina Administrative Code
that pertains to open burning for land clearing or right away
maintenance. The gist of this is under certain circumstances and only so
many times, so you can’t just do this all the time, if you’re clearing a
piece of property that you discover that is was really better to just go
ahead and do the burning on site than to haul everything somewhere else
and then do the burning. So this allows them to burn on site under
certain restrictions.
Section 29 provides with the exception of permits issued to Title 5 of
the Clean Air Act, air quality permits must be issued for term of eight
years. Sometime in the last year or two we did one that said permits up
to eight years, turns out they didn’t move any of them, there’s no
reason why they couldn’t so this just changes it so they must be issued
for a term of eight years.
Section 30 amends the ?? notice requirements for minor permits issued
pursuant to the coastal area management plan, this has to do with
permits, there are three things
  
  
  <h3>035:00</h3>
  <h3><audio src="audio/chunks/20130725_house_2.035.00.mp3" preload="none" controls></audio></h3>
  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/AB1ESZCMZRM9A">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=39KV3A5D176VD975TALMRTK378I7SH&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>
  
  <p>Currently that you have to do if you&#39;re issuing the permits. On the
major plans, it makes sense to have to go through all of them. On the
minor ones, you&#39;re usually dealing just with your nextdoor neighbor.
And so the other two requirements were mailing to the person, and then
posting the notice, and it just didn&#39;t seem relevant - if it&#39;s
just your adjoining neighbors that are impacted - that you also have to
put an ad in the paper.
So in this particular case, since you&#39;re mailing it to the person,
you&#39;re posting it on site, they just won&#39;t also have to post it
in the newspaper form.
Then, section 33, we start off of air quality into others. Section 33
clarifies the process for appeal from civil penalties, when a local
government is administering a state approved erosion and sediment
control program.
It clarifies how they go through that process and then says that the
fines will me remitted to the civil and forfeiture fund.
Section 34 has to do with allowing for reduced flow on wastewater
systems. The wastewater systems that were constructed before we had low
flow toilets and low flow showerheads, they needed to do some
adjustments to account for the fact that people are using less water,
and this allows them to make those adjustments.
Section 35. This has to do with if you are drilling for a private
drinking well, and it&#39;s being within 1000 feet of a known source of
contamination. They need to make sure you&#39;re notified of that, so
this is a public health and safety issue for people drilling wells near
known contamination.
Section 36 is strictly technically. It provides an underground storage
tank and systems installed after a certain date. This is coordinating a
couple of bills that had certain dates, and there was this little gap in
there, and everybody knew what it was, but we just needed to correct it.
Section 37&#39;s also conforming. It has to do with all these language
where they change the federal law, and now we need to change the state
law to confirm with it.
Sections 38a and 38b were actually kind of fun to debate. This has to do
with changing--if you ever get bit by something, you no longer get
anti-venom. You have to get anti-venon. And so we had to change all of
that for what it is we&#39;re gonna give you to make sure you don&#39;t
get sick.
And then it also has a section on what to do if some sort of reptile
gets out and you call the police, or call the wildlife people to come
and get it out of your yard. What kinds of things can they, cannot do,
and how they have to report it? And that sort of thing.
Section 39 allows the Wildlife Resources Commission to deal with the
manner of take. They already deal with most of the rest of the systems
to deal with the manner of take, and if somebody asks me a complicated
question, I&#39;m gonna call on a more avid hunter than I am to
completely describe it.
Section 40 has to do with a state--and there were double clarifications
in here. But if the state, or a community college system, wants to
purchase an ownership interest in real property that has known
contamination, they have to get approval from the governor of the
Council of State.
The reason for this is that oftentimes, it would have to be the state
that would have to go back and pay for that remediation, so we want to
make sure that that&#39;s calculated in there.
Section 40--oh, if you&#39;re doing routine maintenance on the fuel
dispensing pumps, you don&#39;t have to get a building permit. This was
mutually agreed upon.
Section 42, if Dean are in the process of doing a schedule for entrance
fees to the aquariums, they may also do it for peers operated by the
aquariums and other sorts of things like that.
Section 43 is contentious, so you will hear some debate on this. It
repeals the Mountain Resources Planning Acts. So I will tell you that
that was not a consensus provision, but it&#39;s in there.
Section 44a and 44b has to do with, if a local government wants to enter
into a development agreement on developable properties that have some
sort of brown fields agreement, that there was this limit on 25 acres,
and it was causing some problems, and everybody agreed that it
didn&#39;t need to be there. And so it removes that provision.
Section 45 has to do with pruning for a sign for your agro-tourism
activities. These are not billboards, but if you&#39;re going to a wine
tasting or a blueberry farm, and the right of way has allowed to grow up
over the sign, this provides for pruning so that those signs can be
seen.
Section 46a and b is controversial. You probably have received some
information on them. These are compliance boundaries.
The short version on this is if you own a piece of property and you
have... the one that most people hear about is a coal ash pond on it. So
you have the coal ash pond on it, and there are these boundaries around
it.
There are rules about where the testing wells have to be drilled so that
we can make sure that if there&#39;s any contamination in the ground
water, that it&#39;s not crossing the boundary line. This has been
established

  <p>rule for a long time. It has been contested. What this is doing is
simply putting and codifying the existing language, which has been
around for about 40 years, on how that’s supposed to be done. There are
some people that disagree with that and don’t like it, but that is what
I have been explained and what I understand after having gone through
this many times, is it’s codifying the existing language. The wells will
be inside the boundary line. They are there to catch contamination
before it crosses the boundary line. The one thing that is new on this
is, if multiple properties surrounding that particular parcel are owned
by the same entity for the same purpose, then those boundary lines would
be whole boundary line rather than each individual parcel. I do urge
your support on that.
Section 47. worked with the military. There were some of that radio
towers to those towers exempt for the applicability to the military
lands protection act, there’s no controversy on that.
Section 48A. We had done, back a year a two ago, we allowed for
landfills to be permitted, not just for five years, but for ten years.
As part of that, there was a study and we’d done some stuff with fees.
In there they had only put in the ability to construct, not the ability
to operate, this adds the word that should have been in there all along
about being able to operate them.
Section 48...someone just gave me that one. It repeals a provision on
land disturbing activity that had to do with increased vehicular access.
This was something that was slipped into the budget several years ago
that required, in certain areas, that you had to have a percentage of
your paving had to be pervious. Over the years they have found various
problems with this. Either because of cracking due to ice or what do you
do if you have pervious pavement in a gasoline area where you don’t want
it leaching through. There were a number of issues with that and so that
repeals that provision there.
Section 49 is a fee process when someone has violated a solid waste
penalty. What this does is clarify that the money, when you’re
calculating the penalty, that you calculate not only what it would have
cost to repair it, but what did the violator save by doing that. That’s
just adding a piece in there and codifying the existing rules on how
that fee process is determined.
Section 50 is if you want to store recycled materials on site in certain
cases, like asphalt, pavement, roof shingles and such, it defines how
high and how wide that pile can be and where it can be.
Section 51 amends the definition built upon area to include certain
types of impervious surfaces and partially impervious surfaces. It also
puts in an exemption for gravel so gravel would be considered a pervious
surface for the purposes of built-upon area. Bottom line, it’ll allow
you to build on more of your lot if you’re using gravel.
Section 52. If you have an ag pond on your property and stuff like grass
grows up around it, you will not have to treat that as a repairing and
buffer as long as that pond is entirely on your property and it’s only
used for agricultural processes. We were having some problems with a
pond that was used to water cows suddenly becoming a repairing and
buffer, so it would take care of that.
Section 53. If someone is dissatisfied with the decision of the
environmental management commission currently if you are a first or
second party in that you have 30 days in which to protest, but if you’re
a third party you have longer than that and it’s thrown some kinks and
stuff because people didn&#39;t know. They’d think everything was
resolved. They were moving forward and find out later that somebody had
a problem with it. This one basically puts them all on the same
timetable so regardless what your relationship is in the case, you have
the same 30 days.
Section 54 was the one I just read about the pervious pavement.
Section 55. Amends the notice for repairing and property owners that
have joined property subject to an application for a dredge or field
permit. There, again, if you’re right next door and your neighbor is
doing something and they&#39;ve got all the permits out there, this
would require that you talk to them, but doesn&#39;t require you have to
post in the paper and mail it to them.
Section 56. This is for water treatment systems with expired
authorizations. If nothing’s changing and they would have gotten it
anyway but somehow or another it expired, this allows them to put that
back into effect as long as there hasn&#39;t been any changes. It
smooths the system. There was a particular case that had happened and
they needed to get that in.
Section 57 will sound very short, but the vast majority of your bill is
actually section

  <p>57, it directs the Department of Natural Resources to combine the
Division of Water Quality and the Division of Water Resources to create
a new Division of Water Resources. They currently have the same chair, I
mean the same Executive Director, this combines them. The reason for all
the pages in your packet are because they had to go make conforming
changes all through the rest of statute if you combine those two.
Section 58 I will confess that I probably ought to have either
Representative Millis or Catlin describe this, but it has to do with
making sure that engineers and DNR are working properly together and so
if you have questions about that section, it&#39;s been heavily worked
out, please ask one of those two individuals. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, your time is expired, would you like to be
recognized a second time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually that was my last
one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well done. Representative McGrady, please state
your purpose. Representative McElrath, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion. I
have part 6, the solid waste reform provisions in that section 59.
Section 59 brings us in line with federal law as far as making sure that
we don&#39;t disproportionately, landfill doesn&#39;t disproportionately
effect minority and low income communities protected by Title 6. Section
59.1 requires, an EIS is required for landfill and this DNR used to do
that, this now requires a third party to do that and that third party
has to be approved by DNR. Then the one mile buffer for the State
Gamelands has now been, is now only for those buffers that were
established before July 1st 2013, so this is prospective. Then we have a
section that deletes the requirements for the annual cleaning of the ??
Collection Lines but provides that the lines must be cleaned as
necessary for proper functioning and also requires them at least every 5
years to go in with the camera and look at the lines and make sure
there&#39;s no buildup. Let&#39;s see. Then there&#39;s a requirement
that when the Department has approved an alternative method of daily
cover that all of the sedentary landfills use that same cover. then
there&#39;s a requirement for each, and the environmentalist I think
will like this a lot, each landfill that collects more than 240 tons of
waste will have to provide research and development on alternative
disposal technologies. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McGrady, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would ask
if the lady would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As soon as I
finish my comments I will. And then on, there also have to perform a
feasibility study on landfill gas to energy or waste to energy
technology. Section 59.2, there manufacturers of waste trucks are saying
they can&#39;t make them, there&#39;s no such thing as leak proof, so
they&#39;ve gone to leak-resistant here and that we make sure that the
water that accumulates from precipitation is not considered leaking.
That&#39;s covered under there because some of the Highway Patrolman are
stopping our Waste Industries trucks thinking that the water coming off
of them in a rain is leaking when it&#39;s not, so that is not
considered leaking. Precipitation. And there is a Section 59.3 that
defines a ?? to exclude any liquid that adheres to the tires as the
waste industry trucks are leaving the landfills or the transfer station
is really another good area which will discourage our landfills from
taking out of state trash and encourage them, by encouraging them to
take other counties&#39; and cities&#39; trash, it allows the counties
to levy a surcharge or the landfills to levy a surcharge from another
town or county, so it makes it more lucrative for them to take in house,
in state trash rather than to go out of state looking for those revenue
dollars, so I think that&#39;s a good thing for our state and I
certainly, Mr. Speaker, I certainly will yield to that question now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady, the lady yields. [SPEAKER

  <p>portion of the bill that you just explained. Is it not coming directly
from a larger landfill bill that was heard by the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know if it is or not. You talking about Senate Bill 328?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quite frankly, I’ll be honest with you, I haven’t read Senate Bill 328.
This language was provided when we they were doing their conference and
we were asked to look at these. We picked out the ones that we thought
the House would agree with and went with those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then it is fair to say that this language appeared in the bill for the
first time during conference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know where it was on the Senate side, quite frankly, is the
first time that we’ve seen it here, I think. There was quite a bit of
the Senate things in conference that I hadn’t seen before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it is true that section 59 of this bill was not in anything
prior to suddenly jumping into the conference bill. It was not in
dispute. There was no subject like this in the bill. Therefore, under
rule 44b, I believe this being a significant matter that this needs to
be referred to a standing committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House be at ease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, you are correct that the house has that rule,
the Senate does not have a similar rule. Therefore, the Chair would take
the position that the bill before us is properly before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, further question of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Coming back to part B. The first portion of this says that if the Senate
doesn&#39;t have a similar rule, and it provides for that. But I was
referring, actually, to the second portion. If the Senate does not have
a similar rule, which they do not, they just have a germaneness rule, a
conference committee report which includes significant matters that were
not in difference between the Houses, shall be referred to a standing
committee. It would appear, Mr. Speaker, with all deference, that the
first portion of the rule does provide that the Senate has that similar
rule we do, one thing. But the second portion of the rule provides
otherwise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair accepts the gentleman’s argument. We will go into recess and
we’ve ordered this bill in rules and then bring it back to the floor.
Ladies and gentlemen, for your planning purposes, we are likely to go
late tonight. The Chair anticipates objection to a third reading on a
bill that we will take up this afternoon. The Chair does not expect
to…because of the anticipated the objection, we will have to meet
shortly after midnight, but only to take up the one bill that, again, if
an objection occurs. Otherwise, the Chair has made the decision that we
will have session in the morning at 9 AM. I say that to make you mindful
of the fact that we may be here anyway. We will honor the gentleman’s
request and we will have this matter in rules and then back on the
floor. Without objection, House Bill 74 will be removed from the
calendar and re-referred to the committee on Rules. Is there objections?
So ordered.
Representative Moore is recognized to send for the committee report. The
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, for rules calendar operation of the House, Senate
Bill 380 Adjust Landfill permit fee timing. Favorable is House committee
substitute, unfavorable is the Senate committee substitute.

which was referred and potentially a couple of others.
[Speaker Changes]
Senate Bill 523 the clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is back to the bill offered by Representative
Brawley.  This is the pending ammendment by Representative Jordan, and
Representative Jordan is returning to his seat.  The chair understands
that Representative Jordan wishes to withdraw the prior ammendment, and
the gentleman is recognized to send fourth an ammendment that the clerk
will read.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Jordan moves to ammend the bill on page one, line
seventeen.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the ammendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, now I&#39;ve had my ice cream, I&#39;m ready to
go.  Mr. Speaker, this is the change to the ammendment  I was talking
about earlier.  Uh, it simply adds in the excise taxes as well as sales
taxes.  Um, so, it was that perfecting ammendment to which I referred.
Um, the biggest problem with this bill and the problem from the
Department of Revenue,  has to do with sales tax failure to file, rather
than the income tax provisions, because the money cannot be distributed.
 But with income taxes, it&#39;s a different matter.  If you overpay
income tax and don&#39;t file a return, you made a non-interest bearing
lone to the state.  The state has the full use of that money until the
time the entity files a return.  So what I&#39;m doing in this
ammendment is simply, I agree that we should have a uh, penalty for not
filing your sales tax, the Department of Revenue says that&#39;s a
problem, we need to fix it.  But I don&#39;t want to take a sledge
hammer to every tax payer, especially the ones who are due refunds, and
penalize them, when, you know, as things happen, life happens, and you
forget to file your report, or don&#39;t get to it.  So that&#39;s
basically what this ammendment does. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes]
To debate the ammendment.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the ammendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Um, I&#39;m still in the situation I was in earlier, the people of the
Department of Revenue tell me this ammendment has the added affect of
changing the way tax payers are treated, and that it makes the whole
question moot, and we are back where we started.  Um, so I would ask
that you take their word for it because, as Socrates, who was once
quoted as being a very brilliant man because he knew what he did not
know, I know that I don&#39;t know this well enough to say the
Department of Revenue is wrong.  So I would ask that you join me in
trusting them, defeat the ammendment.  Let&#39;s pass the bill.  Thank
you.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.

To see if Representative Brawley might yield for a question.

  <p>The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, Representative. I was with you this morning and I may still be, but
Representative Jordan makes a really valid point and like you, I know
what I don’t know which is a ton of stuff, and I don’t have, I’m not at
all comfortable that anybody knows exactly what we’re voting on. So I
wonder if it’s worth, since we’re going to be here quite a bit tonight,
just at least temporarily displacing so we could actually have some
sense of which one of you we agree with, based on an interpretation from
some legal staff or our staff. And since we don’t have that, I feel
really uncomfortable voting on this at the moment. Would you be willing
to temporarily displace just till we get at least our legal staff’s
interpretation of it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, I
appreciate the gentleman’s dilemma. I certainly feel the frustration
also. I think if this bill had come up a week or two ago, we would have
the time to do that. But if we do that today I think that will have the
effect of killing the bill, and I, what I would prefer we do is we go
ahead and pass it out and we have already amended it in finance
committee, so it will end up in a conference committee. I would hope
that we could send the Senate something to which they could agree. I
know that the Senate had, Senate Rucho who was the primary contact had
told me these issues had been raised in the finance committee in the
Senate, and the arguments had come in that it did basically kill the
effect of the bill and they withdrew, ended up passing it out without
it. We had amendments that were trying to address the same thing in our
finance committee and we ended up pulling them. Representative Stam had
been asked to offer some of the same amendments that Representative
Jordan showed me, he ran them through staff and our staff said it has
the effect of killing the bill and Representative Stam agreed to
withdraw his amendments and not offer them. And that’s why we didn’t
debate these yesterday. And so we’re back again today at this point. I
don’t know what to say. Every expert with the Department of Revenue that
I have spoken with says the bill as amended is acceptable, will
accomplish their goal. The proposed amendment offered by Representative
Jordan will change the bill and it will turn a failure to file penalty
into a failure to pay penalty, which will not achieve the goal that
they’re attempting to achieve. And I’ve already, that’s where I am sir,
and I appreciate your concern. [SPEAKER CHANGES]?? response, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Jordan a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jordan, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, we’ve got opportunity to speak briefly off the
floor about this matter, and I’d like to continue that conversation here
briefly again. In regard to having statute that says that you must file
a report, in terms of certainty from budgetary measures, while we want
all tax payers to actually appear by that statute, to file a report in a
timely manner, regardless if it’s income taxes and they may or may not
have overpaid, that way that we as a state have certainty about what our
numbers are from a fiscal and financial, what is your argument about why
to exclude income taxes, regardless if they have overpaid or not? If the
statute says you have to file a report, why should we do a carve-out
like you’re trying to amend here? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I
appreciate the question. The short answer is because life happens.
Things happen and you don’t get to file your report necessarily. And
we’re talking about tax payers that very often owe, are owed by the
state, so they’ve made an interest free loan to the state. The state’s
able to use that money. We put it in our General Fund. We may have to
refund it later but we have the use of it. We would like all tax payers
to file all reports at all times. It simply cannot happen. And by the
way, that helps me discuss for just a second the people that are asking
me to run this are the accountants and the tax section of the Bar
Association. So it’s folks that help people file returns and very often
small business people can’t get help to file returns and their amounts
are small. So I’m really just looking for some pro-business,
customer-friendly that the Governor keeps talking about, help our small
business. Let the Department of Revenue study why reports aren’t filed,
what’s so complicated about them, and make it easier for our folks to
file the reports when they pay their tax. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker

  <p>May I ask a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, I definitely thank you for that response but I,
and maybe this is not a question as much as it is a rhetorical
question/statement, is that I still can&#39;t get past the aspect if
that we&#39;re requiring individuals to file a report, business income
or not alike and we have the ability to have extensions and all the like
and they actually can file their taxes in a manner, whether they have
overpay or underpay, I just can&#39;t understand why we&#39;re not,
basically we could say, upholding the rule of law for all and not
providing a carve out regardless of what type of business it may or may
not be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t know that I can expand on my previous answer. It may be just
that you have a rhetorical question. It&#39;s just simply to help tax
folks that things happen to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, briefly debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion, or debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I definitely appreciate Representative
Jordan&#39;s remarks as well as Representative Brawley&#39;s and this
time I would urge you to vote against this amendment from the logic that
I&#39;ve heard here today I definitely think it&#39;s important for us
to have a sense of certainty of where we actually understand what our
numbers. I understand the heart behind Representative Jordan in this
matter but if we as a law body here require individuals and businesses
to file reports I&#39;d say that we adhere to that and we have
extensions, we have a process and I don&#39;t really think that we
should carve out some for another. So as I stand right now I&#39;ll be
not supporting the amendment.

are physical note has been prepared on this amendment?

Representative Jordan, has a physical note been prepared on this
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, as the Appropriations Chair, the gentleman does
have the authority to request a physical note. Is that the implication
of the inquiry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would request a physical note be prepared on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, the amendment will be withdrawn. The gentleman
may consult with staff. We are now back on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I&#39;m just an insurance
agent and I was listening to Representative Glazier&#39;s question about
why. It was my understanding, in the Finance Committee, the reason this
bill is before us is because they&#39;re having trouble getting people
who pay taxes, sales taxes, they pay their sales taxes but they
don&#39;t tell them where it came from so they don&#39;t know how to
redistribute it to the counties and the cities. So, in order to force
them to pay their, I mean to file their forms they want a bill that
penalizes them for not filing their forms. But the problem with that is
the constitution says they have to treat all tax payers the same. Is
that, if I&#39;m wrong I feel sure somebody will stop me. They have to
treat all tax payers the same therefore all tax payers that file a tax
form are included in this bill and they did the best they could so that
the personal income tax filer is not hurt and I encourage you to support
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I totally understand what
we&#39;re hearing from some of the people in support of this bill. I was
praying that we could get Representative Jordan&#39;s amendment and then
hopefully work over it and come back in the short session. As you all
know our Governor went all over the state and said he&#39;s going to,
&quot;open the door, I&#39;m going to stick the hand out, we&#39;re
going to welcome business in the state of North Carolina.&quot; He
hasn&#39;t been in office six months and you&#39;re going to tax every
small business in the state of North Carolina, well we don&#39;t have
any jobs. 80% of the jobs in North Carolina are created with small
business. I understand totally we want to treat everyone equally but
make bone about it, these small businesses are getting hindered daily
and when you get a report from the Department of Revenue six months, a
year later, that&#39;s the problem. That&#39;s what we need to fix. We
need to fix problems in the Department of Revenue and hopefully the new
administration said they were going to do that. Well we&#39;ve been in
session now, it&#39;s July, we&#39;re going out and we&#39;re going to
pass a bill to collect a tax that only the small businesses are going to
pay. You&#39;re going to hinder job creation. We all talked about it.
I&#39;m just saying we take a different approach and let&#39;s look how
we can solve the problem

  <p>reaching our hand out some of these guys gonna create jobs for you. Far
more jobs than the big guys. Isn&#39;t it interesting that we give all
the big companies an incentive in millions of dollars to come here with
their corporate lawyers and you give all the small businesses a fee to
come here and try to create a job. So I would hope we take back, vote
this down and come back with a common sense solution. You know it goes
back, we spend millions of dollars going after the lady that makes tips
as a waitress and meanwhile we&#39;re going to lunch with the corporate
lawyers. So I hope that we can do something to work better with these
small businesses and reach our hand out, and I would love to work with
either one of the bill sponsors and hopefully come back in the short
session to come up with something that will work better. I&#39;m just
not happy with this bill at this moment, I hope you&#39;ll vote against
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the gentleman running this bill a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Bill Rawley, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Rawley, I was going to ask Rep. Jordan this, because I saw this
language in his ammendment, but then I noticed that it was actually just
copied from the language in the bill, so I need some clarification here.
Under, I guess it&#39;s on lines 23 and 24, under &quot;b&quot; section
there, it&#39;s saying, as I read it, it&#39;s saying that to file in a
partnership for s corporation, and let&#39;s say I haven&#39;t sent my
form and it&#39;s 5 months later, it says 25% of the amount of the tax,
and then it defines the amount of the tax in those two lines as the tax
imposed before credits and tax payments. So I want to make sure I
understand that. If I owe $1000 in taxes, and I&#39;ve already sent in
$500, and I&#39;m getting a $250 credit, so really I&#39;ve paid
everything but the $250, they&#39;re still going to fine me on the whole
$1000? Is that what that&#39;s saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, sir. And 5% of 1000 would be $50. And it would be a
maximum of  5 months to a maximum fine of $250. But I would also point
out sir, that that is not the fine for you as an individual taxpayer.
That is the fine for a corporation or a partnership or a sub s
corporation that has filed an income tax return for an out of state
resident. So what we&#39;re talking about here are primarily these
business taxes. And if I may also carry this further, in your discussion
of the tax liablility, I had asked Rep. Stone earlier about how much he
would submit in sales tax receipts. And he said it would run from $1000
most months to $2000 in his biggest month. His failure to file a penalty
on a $1000 tax liability, 5% of that would be $50. So that&#39;s the
fine we&#39;re talking about facing. So yes, there are fines in all of
those cases, but they&#39;re not as egregious as one might believe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was using $1000 I think facetiously. I thought it was a very low
figure, but maybe not. But you have raised another question now that I
didn&#39;t understand in just reading the part we have here. Are you
saying this only applies to taxpayers of flowthrough entities who reside
out of state? This doesn&#39;t apply to people who reside inside North
Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
People with flow through income who are filing a D-400 in North
Carolina. This does not apply. So if you are an out of state resident,
but you are paying personal taxes in North Carolina, it does not apply
to you. There is a special provision of the law that allows partnerships
and subchapter s corporations that have partnership members who reside
outside of North Carolina and have no other taxable income in North
Carolina, to file on behalf of those taxpayers. And those taxpayers
would not be hit with the fee, but the business entity in North Carolina
that failed to file would be the one that would actually pay the fee. So
this in no case is going to hit a individual taxpayer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that explanation.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Various speakers have pointed out problimes with this  bill, and
that&#39;s why it didn&#39;t sit well with me when it came out of
finance, so I started looking into it and 	the concern from the Dept. of
Revenue is taking care of sales taxes and other kinds of taxes, exise
taxes that need to be distributed to local governments. And that&#39;s a
legitimate concern, and I hope to work with them and my ammendment will
help fix that. But I still have the feeling about the

  <p>On a revenue in my first session on the finance committee, we had an
issue whether the Department of Revenue discovered tax refunds due to
thousands of tax payers. The department discovered it through it&#39;s
computer flagging program and the secretary at that time, different
administration, but that secretary came and said well we discovered the
refund, the tax payers don&#39;t know anything about it, so we need
y&#39;all to fix the law because we&#39;re not going to give them the
money back until y&#39;all change the law and let us do it. And my
concern is for the people who are dealing with the Department of
Revenue, let&#39;s make it customer friendly. Using a sledgehammer and
forcing the tax payers to change in order to get these reports in is not
helpful. If the department would look and see why these reports are
complicated or difficult, put them online, let&#39;s help the taxpayers
out. They&#39;re sending in their money. Let&#39;s not forget this. This
issue is only about people who have sent in money they just haven&#39;t
filed a report necessarily at the same time. They&#39;re ready to send
their money in, let&#39;s make it easy for them to send the report in,
that helps the Department of Revenue then allocate the money or do
whatever needs to be done. This bill is an easy administrative way out
so the agency doesn&#39;t have to do anything it&#39;s all on the
taxpayers. It&#39;s business as usual and needs to be fixed. If we do it
in the short session or whatever that&#39;s fine, but keep that in mind.
That&#39;s what this bill is doing, forcing taxpayers to fit into the
square hole with the Department of Revenue so the Department of Revenue
can get away with the easy way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, in the opinion of the chair the
request of the fiscal note for the amendment by rule, if you interpret
the rule, if you read the rule literally, would say that the bill needs
to be removed from the calendar. I have checked with fiscal staff, and I
have determined, and the chair was going to rule provided that the bill
had a fiscal note that I was going to consider that in order and
consider that an idiosyncrasy in rules that needed to be changed.
However I have determined that the bill does not have a fiscal note and
therefore in deference to the rule, we will temporarily displace this
bill and direct the bill sponsor to get with fiscal staff and at the
same time the fiscal note is being prepared for the amendment and then
we will determine if one or both will be taken back up and the chair is
really looking forward to it. So we are going to temporarily displace
this bill and get fiscal staff to work.

CHANGES] To debate the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to
debate the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, we&#39;ve already had a good
bit of debate about this airport bill when it came through before and
frankly I don&#39;t like to get into he said she said. I think one of
the reporters asked me what things would be different. And I said I
think I learned some more about how to communicate with my city and
maybe in some places how not to communicate, but said I had thought we
were close to some sort of, not a complete agreement, but some sort of
consensus or working together last night things sort of didn&#39;t go
that way. And yet in the midst of that, a good thing came out of it. And
part of the good thing that came out of it was there was an idea that
had floated, pieces had come from some people on the city side, pieces
had come from some people on this side, and while we had tried floating
it for weeks it had never really gained any traction and last night it
appeared to gain traction. And then once we found out this morning that
it had appeared what I thought was moving in one direction really
wasn&#39;t a number of us had looked at it

  <p>...is a good resolution because the bill that you have before you
addresses to our knowledge as many of the city&#39;s concerns about the
authority in the airport that we can address and addresses many of the
other side&#39;s concerns about the airport as we could address and also
appears to put us in a position to avoid a protracted legal argument, a
legal battle.  One of the comments that we had heard in committee and
beforehand is gee, you knew the city was going to sue you.  That&#39;s
right.  We knew the city was going to sue you, we just didn&#39;t think
it would take eighteen months to get a resolution, and we are convinced
that the existing previous bill would still stand up in court.  What we
didn&#39;t expect is that the city would fire the aviation director.
They said that he resigned.  Who knows.  I think he was fired and so
there needed to be some resolution sooner on that.  And then some people
will say that this is a last minute bill, as I just said, the aspects of
this have been floating for some time.  In fact, we actually already had
it drafted before this came up with a few tweaks and then put it forward
today.
But that said, here are the good things that have come out of this.  The
city, I&#39;ll put the city as having the assets.  This will form a
commission under the City of Charlotte Charter.  They will still own the
assets of the airport.  They will still manage the bonds.  They will
still eminent domain authority.  And they will also have the majority of
appointments to the commission.
In exchange, or the other side of it, this commission that will be
created will be the operations piece.  They will manage all the
financial control because, of course, the revenues of the airport are
not supposed to be in any way encumbered by the size of the city.  So it
will keep all the financial aspects completely separate in terms of the
operations.  It will give the commission the ability to hire, fire, and
train employees.  And it will also give the city the ability to,  I mean
the commission the ability to manage their own contracts, so they can
either contract for services with the city or they can contract for
services with someone else.
I will also address the whole issue of what happens with the FAA.  So
the city will have the assets, the commission will have the operations,
and then we added another piece that we believe was at the request of
one of the city council members and we thought it was a good idea. We
put in an oversight committee.  And this oversight committee will be
appointed.  And they will look at this commission as it is working over
the next two years and provide reports back to the city council and back
to the commission to say yes, this is making progress, it&#39;s working
or here are some things that might need tweaking.  And that would give
them that other outside set of eyes looking at it.
So while none of us are thrilled with the way all this happened, we have
tried for months and months and months and months to come to a
resolution and come to something that we think is best for the airport
and best for all the people involved.  And I actually think that this
will work really well.  I liked the authority option, but I my
court...my airport tied in court for a long, long time just to prove
that what we did was a good idea.  So this is another good idea that
will address everybody&#39;s concerns in a more quickly and efficient
manner, and I urge your support.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the

 Not mine.  Not Representative Samuelson&#39;s.  Not the Speaker&#39;s.
Not Representative Alexander&#39;s.  But the City of Charlotte&#39;s
airport and the region of this state and indeed the state and the
nation.  I told you before it is a multi-billion dollar enterprise.
There&#39;s only one question that I keep asking everybody.  Do we need
to have an authority?  Do we need to change the restructuring of the

  <p>...It&#39;s never been answered. It&#39;s never been debated in the
public eye, with the city council. It appeared up here in January. Now
let me just tell you I&#39;m not a &quot;he said she said&quot; either,
but by golly that&#39;s what this bill has become. You all sat in here
and you either voted for this bill or you voted against it a week ago.
We voted against it over here, argued for it, and said on this floor,
out of my mouth I&#39;ve got the tape from it. There will be a lawsuit.
There are questions not answered. There are legal problems. The
Treasurer&#39;s Office weighed in on the [Bond&#39;s?] situation. There
was a lawsuit after the bill became law. There&#39;s a piece in here
that you weren&#39;t told about that&#39;s about the former Aviation
Director. It&#39;s time to take care of him, let&#39;s take care of the
lawsuit, let&#39;s just bring back a new bill, let&#39;s repeal the
other one while I submit to you that with a lawsuit pending and it is
tied up now in the Court. There is an injunction. Temporary restraining
injunction. If you read that, it says that this state body may not do
anything to the airport. Says it. Legally. The judge wrote it. Supposed
to be in Court next Monday. Now, you can vote to repeal that other bill.
You can vote to do that. But according to that injunction, you cannot
move ahead with a new bill and hurt the city. Not if it impacts the city
airport. I&#39;ve talked to Attorneys. That&#39;s the interpretation.
Our city does not want this proposal that&#39;s before you. I have a
string here, of emails that started last night late, came in this
morning. The City Council has not seen it as a whole and yet again our
airport is in an emergency situation, the State is in a lawsuit named
when an emergency situation, and as Representative Carney said earlier,
Representative Cotham said earlier, were then hijacked.
[Speaker Changes]The lady&#39;s time has expired.
[Speaker Changes Back] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Please vote no and let
the Courts take care of this.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Brawley is [recgnosed?] for a period
not to exceed three minutes.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mister Speaker. We passed a bill, the
Senate passed a bill, the City immediately followed a TRO. There was an
Attorney for the authority that showed up, he was not allowed to speak.
And only the City&#39;s attorney presented and a TRO was, temporary
restraining order, and everybody&#39;s supposed to be locked in place.
So the City decided that being locked in place meant firing Jerry Orr,
he&#39;s been mentioned. There&#39;s a quote out of Europe - Jerry Orr
is only the second best Airport Director in the entire world. The best
director runs the airport in Dubai. We&#39;d be happy to spend the next
eighteen months in Court, it a competent manager was in charge of the
airport. But a new Financial Director is in charge of the airport,
reporting to a new Mayor and a new City Manager. We need somebody that
knows how to run an airport. We need to resolve this. I&#39;m as tired
of talking about this airport as you are, but I can&#39;t stop talking
about it until it&#39;s fixed and I know that those planes are still
gonna be coming to North Carolina, and not Tennessee or Georgia. I ask
your support.

[Speaker Changes] Mister Speaker, are we under a TRO against voting on
this bill or enacting this into law?
[Speaker Changes] Representative Blust, we are not under a TRO. This
bill does not exist under TRO based on the bill that was passed a week

Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 380 on its second reading. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The

Substitute for Senate Bill 380 has passed the second reading without

with what had already been done on the budget, with respect to how
infractions and 3rd class misdemeanors were classified. So we just made

Ask general aid from Mecklenberg, Representative Samuelson, a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative.  I was going to ask you this earlier, but
when the bill got displaced, so I just let it go.  You mentioned a pond
and the area around the pond had grown up for agricultural use.  What
you didn&#39;t mention is what if that pond is a common pond to multiple
owners of property but it pretty much abutts their properties.  Do you
know if that is addressed in the same fashion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll clarify from staff, my understanding was the criteria was is it
for agriculture uses.  And as long as the pond was totally on their, as
I recall, totally on their property and for agricultural uses then it
didn&#39;t have to meet these riparian buffer requirements.  And the
assumption there was it was all on that one property.  I will verify
with staff.  I don&#39;t think that ... you&#39;re talking about if
there&#39;s several agricultural uses that share an area and there&#39;s
a pond that crosses a couple of boundary lines?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll figure...I&#39;ll find out for sure, but my understanding was
as long as it&#39;s for agricultural purposes it doesn&#39;t have to
have those riparian buffer issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft, the chair recalls that you were in the middle
of your explanation of that section.  Would the lady like to return to
that?  [AUDIO ENDS]

  <p>Debate.[SPEAKER CHANGES] And thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady. Well done. That representative McGrady I do believe that gentlemen
was about to be recognized in turn to debate the bill. Or I&#39;m sorry
to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you mister speaker. Colleagues, I used the rules for a
minute to really try to highlight one of the issues with this bill. And
in both, I want to say on front end the sponsors of the bill have worked
with me as best the could to try to keep me informed on things
that&#39;re moving that were obviously of interest to me. But that
largely was a function of the fact that I&#39;ve worked with them in the
past. And if you were another member of this body, probably wouldn&#39;t
have the access to what was going on in the same way that I did. And
that&#39;s probably not right. One of the two original bills here I
actually was a primary co-sponsor on. When we introduced it had two
sections. When it came out of the house it had six. When it came back
from the senate it had 36. At that point it got combined with another
bill and now its bounced back and forth. And it ends up with, I think
61. The last few portions came directly out of a bill that really had
nothing to do with this bill at all. They just arrived at a conference
committee. So I would tell you, I think we could have gotten a better
bill here if we&#39;d used our normal processes. There&#39;s two or
three of the issues here I think could have been resolved, but they
aren&#39;t. And the bill is not as good as it could be. I wanna just
point out four or five sections that are particularly problematical. And
I&#39;ll just refer to the page. There&#39;s been discussion about the
billboard portion of bill. I have a long history on billboards. The
billboard industry ?? about 90% of what it wanted last time. And in this
portion of the bill it&#39;s basically coming back and getting some
more. And I know my colleagues in the oil and gas area of the state have
had the same experience on some agreements that they had. And it just
seems to be the norm. The billboard provision isn&#39;t as bad as it was
when it was initially provided to representative Moffitt who used very
good judgement to cut it back. But the fact is we&#39;re continuing the
trend of loosening and restricting local government&#39;s role in
managing billboards. The section of the bill that used to deal with
local preemption got stripped out of the bill but I think it&#39;s fair
to say that many members of the general assembly just hate rules. And we
just haven&#39;t figured out how to stop state agencies and local
governments from adopting rules without also preventing them from doing
things that need to be done to comply with federal law or protect public
health and safety. This bill adds a one year moratorium on adoption of
local government ordinances that regulate something already addressed by
state or federal environmental rules. That&#39;s on page, beginning of
page nine I believe. The earlier bill tried to address this as I said
through the local preemption provision. While I&#39;m sure the one year
moratorium to allow a legislative study of local preemption is intended
to  be a compromise, it creates some problems. One, many local
ordinances deal with issues that also are regulated by the state
environmental agencies because state rules and permits issued require
the state, sometimes require the adoption of a local ordinance.
Secondly, some of the most fundamental responsibilities of local
government such as addressing nuisance conditions, regulating
development, maintaining public infrastructure, involve activities also
regulate to some degree by the state environmental agencies. And this
one was that was represented the Gelrath raise. State storm water rules
are in place to protect water quality. But local governments may find it
necessary to adopt storm water standards to manage a local flooding
problem. Under this bill the existence of a state and storm water rules
would prevent the local government from adopting a local storm water
ordinance unless there was a unanimous agreement on the content of the
ordinance.

  <p>The third issue has been a particularly difficult one for me and this is
the Mountain Resources Commission. The reason why this provision is in
the bill is sitting back in Seat 120. This provision was passed by then
Senator Joe [Sanquin? Not found in list] and when he was defeated in a
reelection bid by Senator [Heis? Not found in list], Senator [Heis?]
made it his goal to get rid of this. Well, I arrived on the scene last
time and surprisingly I took the law and I made some changes and the
Senate and the House agreed to those changes to try to address some real
issues about appointment of Boards and this sort of thing. But, low and
behold on every sort of bill we&#39;ve come across, there&#39;s been
this provision to knock out the Mountain Resources Commission. And now
it&#39;s going to be accomplished. And they brought it to the House in a
form that we can&#39;t address. I will say this is very personal to me
because, as some of you remember back when we had the fracking debate a
year ago, we got within one vote of getting it passed several times and
I was on the other side of that vote, and there was an express offer to
not kill the Mountain Resources Commission if I would give them my vote.
I didn&#39;t, and so to some extent, Senator [Quin?], you and I have
something in common. We&#39;re both getting payback from the Senate on
this one. Mountain Resource Commission - no money involved. Right now,
Representative Whitmire and I were at their last meeting. They&#39;re
looking at how Western North Carolina can better work with the military.
I don&#39;t understand it. Let me move on. The compliance behind
boundaries Representative Samuelson has touched on. Duke Energy says it
doesn&#39;t change anything of law. Other people say it does. There are
pending lawsuits. This is one of the ones I think we could have done
better. I think we could have worked this one through if we&#39;d just
gotten [under?] the table, but we didn&#39;t. We just took one side of
the argument and put it in the law. And we shouldn&#39;t do that. Solid
Waste Reform, this is the last section of the bill. This bill has never
been considered by the House. It was brought into the Conference
Committee at the last - four people decided. Three people from our side
decided to add this to this bill. According to some of the Speaker&#39;s
staff, this is the good portion of this land bill. Oh, great. This is
the good portion, could you imagine what the rest of the bill&#39;s
like? This is bad procedure and the rules are being used against us to
adopt something that should have seen the light of day. If it&#39;s so
good, we can take it up. And finally, and this is something that
Representative Moffitt and I have debated somewhat with Representative
Samuelson. If you don&#39;t realize it, this bill amends and adopts a
huge number of rules. And we&#39;ve made it really hard to make rules,
because we don&#39;t like them. I understand that, but now having made
it really hard, what are we doing? We&#39;re coming back and adopting
themselves. So sections 20, 21, 22, 28, 39, 52, 59.2 are all provisions
here where we&#39;re adopting or amending rules. I&#39;ll tell ya,
that&#39;s a mistake. We start down that road, we&#39;re going in the
wrong direction. Anyway, I&#39;ll finish up by just saying I don&#39;t
think we should concur. The bill is gonna pass, it&#39;s been greased.
It&#39;s an awful process. There are plenty of really good provisions in
this bill, but I can&#39;t support it given some of the provisions that
are in here. And because of the process and the politics that have been
played in adopting this bill. I urge you to vote no.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Brody, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Well thank you Mister Speaker. I&#39;d like to ask a
question of Representative McElraft, please.
[Speaker Changes] Representative McElraft, do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] I do.
[Speaker Changes] She yields.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, ma&#39;am. Section 59.4 in the underlying
section, it says there&#39;s a fee and there&#39;s a surcharge. I&#39;d
like to ask is that...

  <p>Representative: …is the fee and surcharge the same thing, just by other
words, or are they actually separate entities?
Representative: I think they would be separate entities. The fee is what
they charge the counties now to bring their trash in. The surcharge
would actually be above and beyond that. They could actually put that in
the contract. That entices them to go to counties and cities and say we
have some extra capacity and I know that you have been sending yours to
SC and that they have shut down a landfill in SC. So we are going to
have some of our counties bringing them back to here. This allows them
to do that surcharge here where we can take our trash and nto start
looking elsewhere to bring other states’ trash in.
Representative: Follow up please?
Speaker: Senator do you yield to a follow up?
Representative: I will try to make my answers shorter next time, sorry.
Representative: No thank you very much, I appreciate that. Going a
little bit further than the surcharge, there really are no boundaries or
limitations to that, that I could see in here. So the landfill of the
county could decide what they want to charge.
Representative: Yes I do believe they can. We did not want to dictate
what they could charge. We did not think price fixing was a good idea
either.
Representative: Thank you.
Speaker: Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman of the
house. I share many of Representative McGrady’s concerns on the process
and on the substance of the bill. I think it is true that we have
created a situation where it is impossible for the state agencies to
enact rules so they are coming to us and we are doing it by statute,
instead of the normal agency process, which I think is more deliberative
and more expertise involved. I would like to give some credit to whoever
was in charge of removing the provision that would have repealed the
protest petition. That was a great concern to the citizens of
Greensborough and many citizens across the state who have used this tool
effectively to negotiate growth in their neighborhoods and communities,
but there are a lot of problematic provisions in this bill. I have
debated a couple of times on house bill 74, the original version, that
had us engage in this periodic reviews of rules and automatic expiration
of rules. I think it is a problem and I guess we have just reorganized
the division of water quality and the division of water resources, cut
their budget by 15%, not reduce the responsibilities, but now we have
jumped up the wetlands and water quality rules for the first reviews. I
do not know how deener is going to do that without funding and we are
not providing that for him, so I think it is going to be a problem. I
think that it is a problem that we have seemed to single out local
governments for the environmental rules. We are going to preempt them
for a year unless we have unanimous approval of a governing body, I
think that is a problem. I am particularly concerned about compliance
boundary, as is Representative McGrady. I am sorry I did not have color
copies of this, but I have distributed them out. The rubber band plant
in Charlotte, what effectively the compliance boundary would do, would
push it to the other side of the [xx] River, which flows directly into
the drinking water source for the City of Charlotte. There is documented
coal ash intoxication. Coal ash is a toxic soup of selenium, mercury,
zinc, arsenic, valium, cadium, you name it – tons of carcinogens and
neurotoxins. That is documented – they found these in the water supply
of Charlotte. We have also got it documented in Asheville and at the
[xx] Plant and in Wilmington. So we are now loosening out the boundaries
for monitoring and I think that is a terrible direction to go in. I am
also concerned about the landfill provisions. This body worked very hard
back in 2007 to create a stakeholder engaged compromise on landfill
regulations. We did not have good landfill regulations. We had these
mega dump sites that were supposed to be located in east NC without the
proper protections. So we worked with all sides and came up with what I
thought was a pretty good bill that enacted good regulations to protect
the neighbors and the citizens and the natural resources of this state.
These provisions do lift some of those restrictions. One in particular,
that is troubling to me, is the environment justice provision. We know
that many of these dumps end up in low income and minority communities
and we have state restrictions that are stronger than the federal
restrictions, but now we are going to rely on the federal restrictions.
I think that is wrong. Becky Carney distributed this buffer out. Now to
the credit of the mangers of this bill, they did not remove the buffer
protections that were contained in senate bill 328, but we are

  <p>Now allowing no more buffer protections for future game lands. So you
see this map, this colored map that&#39;s on your desk, we won&#39;t be
having those buffer protections for any other future game lands, and I
think that&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m very troubled by so many provisions in
this bill. I urge you to vote no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative McElraft would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Although we just
spoke about 328 just a little bit with her comments a moment ago, I just
want to make absolutely sure, 328 which has been discussed some here on
the floor, some of the language has found its way here. There&#39;s been
major concern about major, large dumps especially in Northeast North
Carolina but in some of the other areas as well. Does this bill in any
way allow those super dumps to come in the same way that 328 did?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No it does not. It does not take away those buffers at all. Those
buffers are still in place that were in place yesterday. When this bill
passes they will still be in place. The only buffers that will be new
game lands, if you put new game lands in, and you put a buffer around
that, you won&#39;t be able to do any game lands that started after July
the first. What we&#39;re finding out is probably anybody can designate
a game land in one day and that we have to be careful here. We do have
trash in North Carolina. South Carolina just closed a landfill. We have
to be able to permit landfills in this state, or we won&#39;t know where
we&#39;re gonna put our own trash. So, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re
encouraging in state trash rather than the out of state trash, and so
that buffer will not prevent landfills, smaller landfills from coming
just because you designate your land as a game land. So we did put that,
that one restriction in there but it in no way will give you the mega
landfills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Catlin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Millis will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. First of all, I want to compliment you on all your hard work
on this bill and your thoughtful attention to details. This question is
on the most recent addition, which is the landfill solid waste portion
of it. The idea to take, I did go through the draft bill that was in the
Senate, I did send it to my local landfill people and my county leaders
and to make sure that everything was okay and the one issue that came up
that is in this conference report is the trash truck issue, whether
we&#39;re going from leak proof to leak resistant, and by the way my
granddaughter calls them dirty diaper trucks, but I just was just
curious is, can you justify or explain whether or not that&#39;s gonna
be an environmental concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Catlin, thank you for that question. In regard to this
portion of the bill, when you actually read the actual, the title of
that provision, I had the same question sometime back in regard to, if
we&#39;re going from leak proof to leak resistant, are we in any way,
shape, or form relaxing or lowering the bar on the standards that we
have for actually hauling in, collecting, waste here in North Carolina.
And I started to ask some questions, do some research, and do some study
on this, and what I found is that in no way, shape, or form are we
lowering our standard or are we relaxing our regulation in regard to
this. The appearance would be such, but let me explain. To be specific,
if you&#39;re looking at Section 59 of the bill, as well as it ties
into, let me see here, which is Section 59.2F of the bill that pretty
much ends it out. What we&#39;re doing here is that we are codifying in
statute what the existing implementation by rule is in regard to the
collection and transport, the collection and haul of trash here in North
Carolina. So by no way, shape, or form are we relaxing, reducing the
regulation, but we&#39;re actually codifying in statute what the current
rule is. In addition I must say, in regard to what&#39;s going on in
Section 59.2 through A, B through C and D, it is not the general
assembly that is making the decisions of the amendment to go from leak
proof to leak resistant, but is actually the commission.

  <p>So I hope you would appreciate the fact that is not political opinion,
that is going to make this amendment, but rather, technical expertise so
that we make sure that we uphold our responsibility as a body to protect
the environment as well as the aesthetics here in this state. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You yield for a follow up,
Representative Millis ? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The leakage is more along
the lines of rainfall input. Could you explain that, please? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir, Representative Catlin. In regard to the need to amend
the rule, by way of this statute here, is that there is issue from the
implementation of moisture on the tire of the actual waste collection
haul vehicle, as well as there is improper, egregious enforcement on the
fact during a rain event, if you actually have precipitation washing
across the actual vehicle, not the actual trash ledge shape from the
vehicle, but actually the rain fall off the vehicle that we&#39;re
basically trying to establish in statute, that that egregious and
improper enforcement is not further occurring in this state. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I&#39;d like to debate the bill,
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentlemen recognized to debate the conference
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your clarification,
Representative Millis. There are some good things in this bill, one of
them that we haven&#39;t talked a lot about is we&#39;ve added a
provision where well owners that are installing a new well are going to
be notified if they&#39;re doing their well near known contamination,
which is a very good public health issue. And at the same we&#39;ve
taken out the disclosure, or restrictions on the fracking waste, so
it&#39;s very aquifer friendly. And to add to what Representative
Samuelson said on Section 46, we did amend the rules to protect our
limestone aquifers in the compliance boundaries, and I&#39;d like to
clarify a point that Representative Harrison brought up is even though
the compliance boundary might be on the other side of a river,
remediation is required and the compliance boundary is in trouble if it
impacts the water quality standard in any classified waters of the
state; so, that does not mean they can contaminate the river. And also,
if there is any imminent hazard or threat to the environment, public
health, or safety, the compliance boundary goes out the window and
remediation has to take effect, and if it impacts bedrock or coastal
aquifers, limestone aquifers, it has to be remediated. I think
they&#39;ve done a good job on that. All in all this is not the process
I would recommend for a regulatory reform. I think each bill going
through the process separately is the way to do it, but we have what we
have. I think, overall, this has been very carefully coordinated and
debated in the conference committee, and I commend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor to debate conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
When the first House Bill, &#39;74, went over, I was on regulatory
reform. I voted for that bill. I thought we did a good job, common
sense. This is not regulatory reform when it comes back. It is packed
with poison pills from the Senate. It&#39;s packed with pity political
agendas, and we&#39;ve just ?? among ourselves as a House, we have been
hoodwinked on this bill, on our good efforts. Our efforts, all session
long, have just been polluted, I can tell you that. When we talk about
poor regulatory reform and rule making, what this is is political
opinion versus agency and stakeholder expertise, that&#39;s where the
rules are coming from. Representative McGrady laid out, seven or eight
of them right there. Exactly the opposite direction of a whole
session&#39;s efforts in regulatory reform. ??, landfills, and one that

  <p>Sad for me is the loss of our Mountain Resource Commission.  Started in
2008, 4 solid years of hard work, by some of the strongest volunteers
and civic and regional leaders of the mountains.  When I came down here
in 2003, the first time from the mountains, the mountain delegation was
like a covey of quail.  You couldn&#39;t get them together for anything.
 We had no agenda.  It was a Democrat House, Democrat Senate, Democrat
governor, but regionally the mountains were not represented in this
general assembly.  We were not together.  By contrast, the urban cores
were tight, unlike this general assembly,  the Democrats and Republicans
in every urban core stuck together and by golly, they got their share.
The mountains were disarrayed, no plan, no strategy, no communication.
We didn&#39;t get a thing, we just got our pockets picked.  So we looked
at how can we as a region look at our assets, look at our future, look
at things we have in common, start working together, start developing
strategies and communication lines, and build this infrastructure to
communicate to our legislature, and our federal congress as a region, to
get our share, to get represented as a region with power.  That&#39;s
what the resource commission has been about.  It&#39;s not regulatory,
it was not intended to be regulatory, but it is about collaborating and
working together.  And for petty political reasons we&#39;re unraveling
the one thing that&#39;s working to pull us together as a mountain
region.  Democrat and Republican, Independent.  I&#39;ve represented 8
of these counties, probably almost half of them, and they&#39;re all
different.  I mean, when you politic in a mountain, when you cross a
mountain range and go through a gap, you&#39;re in another world.
Another group of political constituents.  Another group of families with
histories that are just very different and interesting.  But we, for the
first time, created an institution to help us pull together.  They
rotate the meetings, bimonthly meetings from local government to local
government all over the region, have great participation.  And again,
the people are appointed by the speaker, the pro tem, the governor, some
standing members, just first class citizens from the mountains and
we&#39;re just throwing it out the window.  So, I just don&#39;t look at
this as good for the state, certainly not good for my end of the state,
and I ask you to not concur and vote no on this motion.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]The current motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman&#39;s recognized to debate the conference
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Ah, thank you, conference report.  I&#39;m standing
here for a couple of points.  First of all, I think we can use this bill
as an example of some of the processed that frustrate a lot of us.  Not
because this bill was particularly difficult, there were some things in
it but, we&#39;ve had to deal with a lot of things down here which have
things we like and things we don&#39;t like, and we have to decide
whether to vote or not, and our constituents, we need to help educate
them because I get emails, Why didn&#39;t you vote against that thing
because it had this.  You&#39;re right, it did, but it also had 10 other
great things, and I had to balance and make a choice, and I think
that&#39;s why, in a representative government, they send us down here
to do that, so we have a lot of that to talk about.  The specific points
here, the Mountain Resource Commission concerns me greatly too.  I feel
like I&#39;m piling on or something but, being from the mountains,
we&#39;re often overlooked, and I thought that gave us one way that we
can get together and talk about our current issues and things that we
have in common.  And it didn&#39;t cost the state any money, but
it&#39;s in this bill.  Something that&#39;s not in this bill, that
started in this bill and also concerns me

  <p>Me is, the protest petition. It&#39;s been taken back out so that it
stays, and I don&#39;t like that. That&#39;s a problem. Remember,
that&#39;s the thing that lets a 5% owner of the boundary of a property
to create an ultra majority vote, an ultra majority vote. I don&#39;t
even know if we have that big a vote anywhere else in our law, but it
made that. We took it out and for some reason it got back in. That&#39;s
a shame. I don&#39;t like that either. So something has been taken out,
something that was in there and taken out. But even with that and even
with other things in there, the main reason that I&#39;m gonna be voting
for this bill, even if there was nothing else, has to do with Section
19. Section 19 regards the issue of carbon monoxide. And the reason this
is of particular interest to me, as it really should be for everyone, is
because I stand here with heavy heart because it&#39;s not a theoretical
issue. It&#39;s an actual, practical thing that has happened. In my
district three people are dead since April because of carbon monoxide in
lodgings. If this bill had a hundred other things that I didn&#39;t like
I&#39;d still vote for it because this issue is vital. What we&#39;re
doing is making the Building Code Council work to adopt rules that going
forward these detectors will be in new construction. That&#39;s why we
do regulations. When we talk regulatory reform our critics want to say
that we want to get rid of all rules. That&#39;s absolutely not true. We
have rules for a reason. If rules are here to protect public health and
safety, we need to pass them. This is clearly one that does that.
Section 19b requires installation of battery operated or electrical
detectors beginning this October until the short session when we can
work on some other things. So we&#39;ve got something in place for the
immediate future because again, this is not a theoretical issue that
people might be harmed. A legislator in West Virginia has contacted us.
They had a death in 2012 from the same thing that happened in my
district. Carbon monoxide is killing people. Starting October 1, 2014,
we&#39;re gonna require the installation of electrical hard wire
detectors. Now we&#39;re taking a little bit of time to look at this
because there&#39;s a lot of issues to look at. If you look at the
definitions in this bill, any rooms, sleeping room that shares a common
wall, floor or ceiling with an enclosed space having a fossil fuel
burning heater, appliance or fireplace, because that&#39;s where the
carbon monoxide comes from. The problem we had discovered from the
family of some of the victims is that this language doesn&#39;t actually
help prevent those deaths that happened in my district. That&#39;s why
we need to look at this and make sure we do it right, to do it right,
because in that case the room was next to the exhaust. It wasn&#39;t
right there adjoining the room with the heater. In West Virginia, the
room was several floors up. So we&#39;ve go to do it right. In the
meantime however, we&#39;ve got the battery powered and electrical so
we&#39;ve got something going on for the immediate future to help fix
this. We&#39;re gonna fix it in the future. We&#39;re directing a study.
These folks, the Building Code Council, Department of Health and Human
Services and Commission for Public Health are going to report to us at
the short session about what they&#39;ve discovered, how we can fix
this, how we can do it right, how we can save people, how we can show
that these rules, when they&#39;re for public health and safety, we can
all together and support. So, if for nothing else than that one section,
my decision is to vote for this bill. If nothing else except for this
one section, I would strongly urge you to consider voting for this bill.
Thank you.

environment of the state that regulation does have a role in this
chamber but it’s very good for us to look at the efficiency and the
effectiveness of the regulations that we have in the books that put a
yoke and a burden on our citizen’s back at home and this is exactly what

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore I noticed that on with respect in section 2 on bill
fallings that the deadline for requesting bills is two days into our
session May 16th if I’m reading that correctly. Is there a reason why
that’s so immediate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Give me just a moment. I would imagine Representative Luke that is
consistent with what&#39;s been done in years past we simply had this
Adjournment Resolution was prepared by staff consist of what&#39;s been
done, with what&#39;s been done in the past I will tell you and it’s
specifically direct that I just ask him to do the Adjournment Resolution
as it’s customer.

I follow up, aye.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore I can tell you that it is not consistent with past
sessions that we have always give members more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just reminded of something that is easy to forget any member can
request bills now between now and then. Again, I was just reminded that
by Legal Council that this was actually drafted by Mr. Cohen to be
consistent with prior Adjournment Resolutions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, if I may just ask…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thinking again, I can assure you Representative Moore that it’s not
consistent the idea of two days if there are only two days to consider
what legislation we wanna request with staff, I’m wondering whether you
think about extending that by one week not necessarily not this moment
but whether you would be consider doing that in…

discussion, further debate? Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My good friend Dr. Jones went and found the Adjournment Resolution from
2009, and I would point out that it was exactly consistent, that on that
occasion the House reconvened on May the 12th of 2010, and that the
deadline to get the requested bill drafting was May the 14th of 2010. So
that was exactly two days after, just like this adjournment resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the passage of House Joint Resolution 1023 on its third
reading. Those in favor will say aye, those opposed will say no. The
ayes have it, and House Joint Resolution 1023 has passed its third
reading and will be sent to the Senate. Senate Bill 515. The clerk will
read.

Lake Session Laws and provide for alternative implementation of the
Protection of Existing Buffer Rules. The General Assembly of North

This bill will be temporarily displaced at the moment. The House will be
at ease for one moment. Representative Luebke, the Chair also just
wanted to remind the gentleman that another part of the rules that we
adopted include the ability for any committee to introduce a bill after
the deadline with the consent of the committee. So that is another
vehicle in addition to the time between now and session. I just wanted
to make sure you were aware of that part of the rule as well. Ladies and

fully debate the bill the chair would be willing to entertain that if it
doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;re...if it looks like we can adjourn
earlier and not be here until midnight so that you all can consider and
we can discuss after recess. It may very well be that we&#39;re gonna be
here anyway &#39;cause we&#39;re waiting on a bill that I anticipate
some debate but if not it&#39;s something to consider just for the
purposes of getting the members out but providing the centing side on
that bill a time to debate the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Further notices and announcements? The House will be at ease I do
believe we have a couple of committee announcements the members will
remain in the Chamber momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen we&#39;re trying
to get information regarding the status of certain messages we expect
from the Senate. And what we&#39;re trying to do just to make optimum
use of our time we&#39;re probably going to see about five minutes to
see whether or not it will be worth while to take care of bills we
don&#39;t anticipate lengthy debate before we recess because we also
anticipate a rules meeting that will cause us to go into another recess
so with your indulgence we&#39;re probably gon&#39; need about five
minutes to work that out. The Chair will provide and hour of our dinner
break at the appropriate time here shortly. The House will be at ease.

report for the Bill and I ask that I briefly explain it. Members, the
first section of this Bil has to do with what counties, about the
counties responsibility for medical cost when a person is arrested or in
custody. This language is, is a result of a compromise that was reached
this afternoon between the county commissioners and the hospitals. All
the parties are in agreement with this language. It was agreed upon and
takes care of all the concerns and that&#39;s a, that&#39;s an issue
apparently that has been brewing for a few years. So, we&#39;re glad
that we&#39;re able to get that resolved. The, the other section has the
language with respect to the, filling the vacancy of the District Court
Judges. We&#39;ve debated that already. That&#39;s the one, this, this
language is the House language that came, that
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, the Chair apologizes, but the
Clerk tells me the, the conference report that is on the Dashboard is
not the correct document, so we&#39;re going to have to bid ease for

Glazier. Representative Moore (??), was the gentleman completed with his
comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;ve debated that, I was going to say we included the amendment
that Representative Glazier had supported on the 30 day provision. And
the language about notary&#39;s public was scaled back significantly to
have it just be as a report to the Secretary of State, and that was all
met with approval of all the parties who had expressed a concern there.
So, ?? the body&#39;s continued support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I&#39;ll be very brief, but I support all
the provisions in the bill except as we&#39;ve continue to oppose, most
of us on this side of the aisle, section 4, because it again takes away
the authority of the bar. And, doesn&#39;t matter how many bar
nominations the bar sends up, the governor now doesn&#39;t have to
choose someone that the bar recommends, and makes the judicial vacancy
appointment process totally a political one independent, in my view, of
mayor (??), for the reasons I&#39;ve set out before, and most folks on
this side of the aisle have voted against that bill. I continue to
oppose it. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And very briefly, I do want to again emphasize
the fact that we&#39;re cutting out our local bars from this process.
And if they don&#39;t feel that their decisions make a big difference,
or make a difference, to be just sent up here, then we are disengaging
them from the process. And I think it&#39;s something that we really
need to think about. And I think all of you, at some point and time in
your communities, have lawyers who have done fine service for your
communities, and they will be left out of the process. They won&#39;t
feel that their actions are meaningful because they want to at least be
able to send one of the final three appointees on the list.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know, again, we&#39;re debating a section
that&#39;s the same as what it was when it left the House. But I do
believe that this is a good section. You know, we have a duly elected
governor who should not have his hands tied. And I&#39;m sure the bar
will and will still be able to, I know they&#39;ll be able to send
recommendations, but this is simply giving him the flexibility, that if
he&#39;s not comfortable with the names, that are sent to him..

  <p>. . . the duly elected governor of this state can make that decision on
his own as to who should be appointed to District Court judge, and his
hands won&#39;t be tied by a group of folks who are not elected by
anyone in any of those judicial districts, and it gives him that
opportunity. And I think this is a good bill. I think that&#39;s a good
provision, and I think this is a good compromise. But could it simply ??
pass the provision that removes completely the judicial district of the
bar association&#39;s input from this, but we did not. That was left so
that they could continue to provide the governor with input and have
that advisory-type role and not tie his hands. So I think it&#39;s a
good compromise, and I would certainly encourage the members to support
to conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Starnes ??, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized ?? the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, you know that the court system is so important in this state, and
we&#39;re always searching for the most qualified judges that we can
find. And I think the bar association has done a good job in the past of
identifying qualified and good candidates, but we want to be able to
make sure that the governor has the authority to pick the best person
that can do it. Sometimes the best person may not be on the list that
the bar association submits. So it just expands that list so that others
can be considered. No one will be appointed to the bench who is not
eminently qualified, and I urge you to support  this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion further debate on the motion? If
not, the question before the House is the motion to adopt the conference
report for Senate Bill 321. All in favor vote Aye. All opposed vote No.
The clerk will open the vote.
[PAUSE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
Sixty-seven having voted in the affirmative, 43 in the negative, the
conference report for Senate Bill 321 has been adopted. The Senate will
be so notified. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to recess for an hour
and a half. Let&#39;s call it until 7:15. The technical corrections bill
will be prepared. We may have to provide a little bit more time for the
staff to prepare the technical corrections bill. We&#39;re consulting
with the Senate. We hope to have that done over the next 20 or so
minutes. After that, the drafting process will require an hour or so,
and then there will need to be a Rules meeting, so it may be that we
come in simply so that we can notice the Rules meeting and go on to
Rules.  And I think right now that if we break for an hour and a half,
it should give us enough time. If something should come up, check email
or check with the clerk. If we think there&#39;s more time, we&#39;ll
try and let you know so that you can use your time as productively as
possible. Notices and announcements? Rep. Starnes, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Republicans will caucus at 6:45 in Room 544.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further notices and announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.  Chair --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep.Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Clarity from Rep. Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rules ??, Rep. Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Rules is not scheduled to meet during this break, so
you can have a good dinner. This is one of those times when the Rules
committee members, we actually get to eat when everybody else does, so
we&#39;ll meet after we&#39;ve come back in session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Moore, you&#39;re getting better every day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, ladies and gentlemen, the House will be in recess
subject to ratification of bills and resolutions ??, receive the message
from the Senate, receive the committee reports, conference reports,
re-referral of bills and resolutions, appointment of conferees and
modifications to the calendar. We will re-convene at 7:15 p.m. The House
stands in recess. [GAVEL DOWN]
