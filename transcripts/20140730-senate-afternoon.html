Members will go to their seats, members, guests in the gallery will
please silence all electronic devices. The Senate is back in session.
Members, we have a supplemental calendar.  Hopefully you’ve got it on
your desk.  Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, send forth a conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward your report. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Conference Report, House Bill 1145.  Mr. President of the Senate,
Speaker of the House Representative . Conferees appointed to resolve the
difference between the Senate and the House of Representatives on the
House Bill 1145  The bill will be entitled an act to require mopeds to
be registered with the Division of Motor Vehicles. And if operators of
mopeds to have in full force and effect a policy of financial
responsibility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion relative to today supplemental calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Conference report for adoption Senate Bill
163, I ask that it be removed from today’s calendar and placed on
tomorrows.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, House Bill 761, regulatory reform act, I ask that it be
placed on the end of the supplemental calendar please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I move that the rules be suspended to the end that all
messages send tot eh Governor and to the House will be by special
messenger
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I think that’ll do it for now
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got a feeling he’ll be back.  House Bill 884 the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 884. Dropout prevention recovery pilot charter school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman’s recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President this is a charter school that has met all the application
criteria, has been approved and they simply need approval for us to
allow them to get started.  What it will do is take dropouts, ?? kids
that are a couple of years behind that are in the high schools now or
those who may have recently dropped out and give them a program to catch
them back up so that they will become high school graduates, it will
improve the dropout rate . In Florida 83% of those ids went onto a two
year technical program or a 4 year program.  We have about 25% of those
kids doing that.  Some in Mecklenburg schools wanted this and it was
sort of initiated with their delegation about 2 years ago .  I do have
an amendment, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward your amendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  This amendment simply allows one change in
the ordinary rules and operations. Every charter school gets the
additional funding for their projected students.  That will happen in
this case.  But by trying to get these dropouts and back in the program
it will take a little longer to get them up to full speed. Which means
that we will ask for a second look in the 5th month rather than the 2nd
month.  The 2nd month is true for the public schools, if they miss the
projection they send the check back. If this charter school misses its
projection by the 5th money than they will send the money back if they
are funded for more than ?? they have.  And that’s basically what it
does I ask for your support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to commend Senator Tillman for this effort tot bring this
forward and I have a auestion for him later but we’ll  move forward on
this amendment and I”ll ask that question after the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion on the amendment? Before we take that vote,
Senators Parmon, Newton and Meredith are granted leaves of absences,
excused absences for the remainder of today’s session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Tillman will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, by all means
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to make sure I understand the amendment.  So the current
Section 5.</p>

It’s quite long about 15,20 lines and you are replacing with a proposed
amendment which is 3 lines. What are we giving up in the language that’s
been there.
[Speaker Changes]  Basically what we are giving up is all of the
verbiage about second month versus the first month. We may do a 20 day
report a true up report every second month. This simply gets rid of all
of that and allows us to do the true up from the fifth month for this

Senator McLaren what purpose you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr President. Speak on the bill and offer an
amendment
[Speaker Changes] Send forward your amendment and the clerk will read
[Speaker Changes] Thank you very much  I think its on the dashboard in
the process again. Placed
[Speaker Changes] Senator McLaren moves to amend the bill
[Speaker Changes] Senator McLaren has the floor to explain the amendment
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. Last week we had conference
committee report on the charter school bill and I asked a question about
transparency and openness of salaries and Senator Tillman certainly gave
me a explanation which I appreciate. But actually have some further
questions related to that procedure in that conference committee report
and after some further I just feel that the amendment that I am
presenting addresses the concerns that I have as well as many other
folks have about full disclosure of charter school employees  who are
paid with public funds. And I stress paid with public funds.  We all
know how hard people work to pay their taxes and we owe it to them and I
know all of us agree to show them where their tax dollars are being
spent. All salaries paid with public funds in my view are to be known by
our tax payers. As long as there are school personnel whether they are
in traditional public school or charter school being paid for by public
funds, we owe it to these citizens tax payers of our state to fully
disclose the salaries that are funded by the tax payer dollars. This
simply makes it clear that I will be transparent and open and I commend
this amendment to you. Thank you
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate on amendment 2.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Soucek, what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Just to see whether Senator McLaren will yield for a
question
[Speaker Changes] Senator McLaren, Do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] I certainly yield
[Speaker Changes] Thank you president. Just to my understanding, is this
a issue that we have debated in the previous charter bill or is it
directly responsible for one specific pilot program in [??] Is this
something that affects the entire charter school population?
[Speaker Changes]  Yes That’s Correct
[Speaker Changes] Thank you
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate. Senator Tillman what
purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President. That amendment has nothing to do with
the bill. He wants to talk about the general charter school bill  you
missed your opportunity. We have many agencies in this state that
operate with public money. And none of them that had contract with
private organizations as far as I know have to reveal that those
management employees. And if a management company owns a charter school
every employee employed by the charter school salaries revealed just
like the public school. But the higher level positions are not  [??]
apply to this bill as far as I can see in this charter application
[Speaker Changes] Mr President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Stein what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes] To debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes] I fund what senator Tillman just said to be frankly
incredible. I don’t know a single contract in which the amount of that
contract is not [??]. Any time the state any agency enters in to a
contract.</p>

<p id="10:00">
It is public. That’s the default rule. There may be instances where for
competitive reasons I think there are a couple of instances in hospitals
where the terms of the contract may not be public but the amount of the
contract is always public. We owe that to the tax payers. But for some
reasons a charter school is allowed to employ a principal an
administrator under a management services contract and for some reasons
people don’t have the rights to know how much the people are paying that
person. It’s unprecedented shielding of the public of the information
they have the right to know. I encourage you to spare this moment
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate. Senator Brisson. What
purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Motion please. We move that this house bill 884 to be
displaced on the end of the day calendar.
[Speaker Changes] Objection so ordered
[Speaker Changes] Senate bill 883 clerk will read
[Speaker Changes] Senate bill 883 Mitigation buffer roads waste water
treatment
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock is recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the
senate. The house made one change to the bill that we had sent over. If
you look at the bill, section 3 is using [??] for infiltration and waste
water disposal which we simply cannot do. But this should help
processing of some the waste water. I urge your support as it was a
agreed change by the house
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate on the motion to concur
on the house committee substitute senate bill 883.
[Speaker Changes] Mr President
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] can I ask Senator Brock a question?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir
[Speaker Changes] he yield
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock do you just review the most significant
portions of the bill to start with. Just to refresh my recollection.
[Speaker Changes] What is is it a follow up that you are asking a
question follow up from what the house changes or from what we voted in
the beginning.
[Speaker Changes]  Please state your Question Senator McKissick.
[Speaker Changes]I was interested in knowing what we voted on from the
very beginning to refresh my recollection since it is popping up on  the
dash chance to go back and remember the details of the original bill and
then if you review once again. Again  I know you guts highlighted the
significant revision. But jus t to let us know what has changes from the
original bill. Most importantly what was in the original bill to start
with
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Senator McKissick. What happened is Deaner
requested the bill at the last moment right before the bill drafting
because the rules were if we had contentious issues on the rules and the
deaner has gone back with the stakeholders to go back and rewrite the
disapproved original rules and rewrite the rules. And this would also
allow to ensure temporarily so that no projects are lost in that time
because if we did not have this thing we might lose a couple of
projects. And the next part was the going back to the waste water using
[??] just what was said in the house which is something that we can’t
guaranteely do in the state but is a good add.  By then.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up Mr. President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock, do you yield for a follow up?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir
[Speaker Changes] He yields
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock you are indicating that all the
interested stake holders , environmentalists as well as the deaner all
on board with what we have now.
[Speaker Changes] I won’t say everybody is on board and literally do we
have everybody on board. They have some issues. We did have some people
who want to shut off the [??] all together. They are not happy with this
bill. But as we try to grow the economy and grow jobs here in North
Carolina we would like to see this bill through make sure people have
money invested in projects doesn’t carry through and continue on the
process of creating jobs in North Carolina. Thank you
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate. Hearing none, the

I’m wondering, basically listening to the rumors I understand that we’re

Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, members, Senate Bill 403 was

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.   Also, Mr. President, during the break the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Members, Senator McLaurin you brought up a
good topic and I think it deserves a lot more study.  So what this
amendment will do, will mandate that the state board of education and
charter Schools Advisory Board shall jointly  report to the General
Assembly by December 15th on the utilization of contracts for personal
services by local boards of education and charter school boards of
directors.  Courts show include purposes and the extent of such
contracts prevalent that the administrative district and charter schools
statewide.  I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment 3?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment does what we all know it all does, which is to
essentially kill Senator McLaurin’s very good amendment that I don’t
think we need to study.  If you’ve got a principal working at that
school, we should know what that salary is. If you’ve got an assistant
principal working at that school, we should know what that salary is.
We shouldn’t know, the people should know, the people are the ones
paying that contract. This is a better way to avoid answering a question
to which we already know the right answer and that is to allow the
people to know how their money’s being spent.  in all public schools in
North Carolina, including charter schools. I’m going to be voting
against this amendment not because I have a problem with it particularly
but because I have a problem with its effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman’s recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein’s misinformed and a lot of times he’s right on target. But
he told you all in an earlier speech today that it was incredulous that
you could have management companies that would have public money and not
reveal everybody and everything.  He doesn’t know this but I think maybe
I told him, LEA’s sends management companies all the time to do outside
contractual work.  They don’t reveal those salaries. Now Senator Stein
wants to vote against this amendment which will give us a good look at
all of them, all the public and the public charter schools. What the
contracts do, what ought to be revealed, what ought not to be revealed.
And we’ll do a thorough job and we’ll include the public schools with
this and I think that would be something you ought to be able to vote
for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment 3?  Hearing none, question
before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 3 to House Bill 884.  All
in favor will vote aye, all oppose the vote no. 5 seconds will be

neglected to indicate that senator Jenkins have requested and with your
permission is granted an excused absence for the remainder o the

Amendment 3 passes  And the bill is back before you.  Any further
discussion or debate on House Bill 844.   Senator Ford, for what purpose
do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, see if the bill sponsor will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.   Senator Tillman can you explain to us in
your special way what Section 5 will do to Charlotte Mecklenburg schools
as it relates for the allotment of pavement for this particular charter
school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
MR. President, Mr. President I’d like to respond  Senator Ford, that is
not only a good question that’s a great question.  Your superintendent
Prior was all for this bill.  Your current superintendent, Dr. Morrison,
loves the concept of this and endorses it.  Because we’re taking
dropouts and potential dropouts that they have trouble with anyway and
their dropout rate is so high that they’re only saving about 35% of the
kids from dropping out and this new charter.</p>

who has an 83% success and those gone on to a two or four year or
technical college. That’s great results. The question is, what about the
funding. There’s a lot of people confused about this funding and the
best way to explain it would not be Harvard Law terms. It’ll be the
sawmill version. Charlotte Meck will start the year and at the end of
the 20 day report, they will send in, they will get a projected number
to start with and we’ll give them all that funding. At the end of the
second month, if they’re not there and they miss their projection by
more than 1% they’ll send that money back as always. In a new charter
startup, they’ll project their number and the will project 224, they’ll
get funded for all of that. Charlotte Meck gets all of theirs. Year one,
nobody loses a dime and I want the superintendent over there to know he
loses nothing. If the second year, when he doesn’t have those students,
he doesn’t need the ADM, wouldn’t get it anyway if they go on or dropped
out, the charter school will get it based on their head count in year
two. Now, in year two, if some of those kids went to this charter
school, yes they would lack the funding for those because they don't’
have them. They lose nothing. The only thing that anyone is concerned
about is the fifth months ?? which we’ve allowed for this school because
these kids have dropped out. You’ve got to find them and get them in and
you won’t have them all in the first month. Therefore, we got to make
some allowance when these kids get there, probably by Christmas, second
semester. There’s a fifth month ?? that will cost them nothing in year
one. They’re worried about that. There could be some negativity in the
second year when they don’t have the money for the kids that had gone.
They lose nothing.
