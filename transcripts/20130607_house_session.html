The Sergeant of Arms will close the doors.  The prayer will be offered
by Representative Marvin Lucas.  Members and visitors of the gallery,
please stand and please remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]My fellow legislators, it's Friday, and it's a day that
we normally don't meet, but it's a day that the Lord made.  The American
patriot Thomas Payne once that 'These are the times that try men so,
some are a sojourn sunshine patriot may in the time of crisis, shrink
from the service of his country.'  We will not shrink.  I refer you to
excerpts for Ecclesiastes.  'To everything there's a season, and a time
for every purpose under the sun, a time to plant, and a time to pluck up
that which is planted.  A time to break down, and a time to build up, a
time to weep, and a time to life.  A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
 A time to keep, and a time to cast away.  A time to eat solids, and a
time to speak.  But most of all, a time to love, and not hate.'  Let us
bow.  Kind Father, help us to love, not hate.  Help us to cast away
stones, help us to love mercy and to walk humbly with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of
America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

We sent that back to the ?? commission. The other session which was the
land owner protection fund in the original senate version they took the
land owner protection fund and well they didn't have it just make sure
I'm not getting ahead of myself here. land owner restitution fund and
basically for anyone that had fraud or deception or misrepresentation in
the facts related to oil and gas interest in the contracts we want to
make sure we'll able to protect them.  The next one was getting ahead of
myself was the land ?? registry in the senate bill they took it
completely out and what we did in the house version we actually put some
teeth in it we wanted to make sure it had some real meaning and the 2012
provision required ?? to establish and maintain a registry of  land ??
operating in this state under this statute land ?? is defined as person
that is in the course and scope of the person business doing the
following hold on, the way we have it  the statute authorizes the ?? to
deny restoration  to any applicant for 5 different reasons this bill
amends the land ?? registry to advise violations are punishable
administrative penalty not to exceed 5,000 per violations so that was a
big change in what the Senate had the next point was the offshore
protection fund we increased that fund to 500 million and the reason we
did was we got the number from New Orleans and what happen in New
Orleans we thought was very important that we were able to establish
that fund also establish the fact that if we did have any problems the
state of NC can sue and as for the attorney fees back in the process as
well. The next part of that bill allows the governor  to have direction
for the offshore energy compact we thought it was important for the
governor to work with the governor of SC and Virginia to develop a
reasonable strategy strategy for the expiration of offshore energy and
in the last part of that bill modifies the electrical requirements to
allow hospitals to use compressed natural gas Mr Speaker I would like to
ask if we have staff available for any questions on the floor?</p>

Thank you Mr. Speaker.  This bill is a fantastic bill. I think it's a
good consumer protection bill.  It walks the line between being a good
business economic development bill plus protecting the environment and
protecting our citizens.  Representative Stone and Representative Boles
have worked on this bill a long time.  I think it is in congruency with
what we said we would do last time in H20 and I think it dovetails
nicely.  I think  the key component for me is that it comes back to, the
rules comes back to us as a legislative body.  We all have a
responsibility for our citizens and our constituents to look at those
rules and say yes we like them or we don't like them, they're the best
practice or they're not the best practice and they're the protection
that we think they should be or they're not. It will come back to us to
decide that. So we'll have another bite at the apple, so to speak.  So I
want to commend Representative Boles and Representative Stone for doing
a fantastic job and I ask for each one of you to vote on this bill, vote
yes on this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, in the Commerce Committee you
put forward an amendment related to the Energy Jobs Committee or
whatever the specific name was and to move it from ?? where it is in the
bill to Commerce and then in Environment you didn't offer that amendment
indicating you were going to talk to the administration.  I assume you
came down leaving it where it is but could you explain why you changed
your view or what additional information you got.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative McGrady.  What we had, talked
to Secretary Scolara yesterday and some of the Governor's staff ?? also
and talked to Representative Stone and Representative Boles.  I had an
amendment that was prepared.  We just couldn't get the amendment
prepared in time but with the momentum of this bill I'd like to see this
bill passed out and will promise we'll work on that in conference and
get that fixed.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] And to send forth an amendment.  Thank you Mr. Speaker
and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I want to echo the sentiments
that have been expressed of Representative Boles and Representative
Stone and the House Leadership on fixing a very problematic Senate bill
and taking out a lot of the troubling provisions and sending us a much
better bill for consideration in the full House.  I still have some
concerns.  I think, I disagree with Representative Catlin.  I do think
that this lifts the moratorium on fracking beginning March 1st, 2015.
And this is particularly problematic.  We saw that Denar Study last
session, that 400 page study that listed a number of items that were
potential problematic for North Carolina and that needed further study.
Now there are some studies in here but it's a very complicated, we have
a shell gas resources that are close to our drinking water sources that
may endanger and subject to contamination our limited drinking water
sources in our State.  We don't really have a history of extracting
industries in our State.  We have a mining and energy commission that
we've charged with establishing these procedures and they're working
hard but we don't know that they're necessarily going to have these
rules in place in time for these permits to be issued and that's a
problem and we also don't know because of the language of the bill
whether the permit holders are going to have vested rights and rights to
appeal and those issues were raised in committee.  So I think there are
some problems associated with that. That's the fracking piece of the
bill.  This also promotes offshore drilling and I think that many of us
are concerned about what that means for our coast.  We have a $3 billion
economy at our coast that depends on clean marine life and a clean
coastal economy.  67,000 North Carolina jobs are dependent on that.
We've got a biologically rich area off the  point, Cape Hatterus, that's
one of the most biologically rich areas on the east coast and that's
where many of these potential resources, oil and gas resources, are
located.  So that might be at risk if we start fracking, i mean, sorry,
drilling. I think in addition the way</p>

That the Energy Jobs Council has changed and the Energy Policy Council
has changed. And that  Energy Jobs Council is problematic. The Energy
Policy Council was established several decades ago, but was revised
three years ago by this very legislature. And we expanded it and
included a number of stakeholders who are involved in energy policy.
Debate North Carolina which included renewable energy,energy efficiency,
and low income energy and those were all removed in this,these changes
to the Energy Policy Council which also has moved from Commerce which is
the job promoter to DENR which is the job, which is the environment
protector and the regulator. So I do have some problems with that. So I
think that it’s unfortunate. I really appreciate the leadership and the
bill sponsors for bringing us a better bill, but I’m still troubled by
it. And Mr. Speaker, if I could be recognized to send forth an
amendment?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I offered a
different amendment on the same subject yesterday in committee, but this
would simply delay the issuance of  any permanence for oil and gas
exploration in North Carolina until the EPA’s completed its study on
fracking. The EPA’s began a study a couple of years ago and they
anticipate to be finished by the fall of 2014. There have been a number
of case studies around the states including Dimmicks, Pennsylvia and
Pavillion, Wyoming. Where they’re finding contamination in the
groundwater resources. And so I, it’s been pointed out to me that some
of the shale gas resources intercept with our water table close to
Jordan Lake imperiling that important drinking water source and
potentially pouring those contaminants into the Cape Fear River. That
could impact many and I would just urge your support because this would
delay any permits being issued until we actually understand the water
quality impacts of fracking. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Representative Stone, please state your purpose.

Ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to oppose the amendment. We worked hard

I think Representative Harrison has the same concerns that we have on
this side. And I want to assure you that we working toward more
information as we proceed. We have a long ways to go. And we need to
keep this bill moving in the right direction. So we can assure ourselves
that we‘re gonna have the best rules and regulations in the nation. So I
ask you to oppose this amendment.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, besides all of the points
that Representative Harrison has made about the safety of the water once
we’ve start this process. There is additional research that’s being done
currently that is showing that the chemicals from fracking are
particularly harmful to women and women’s health. And so I would ask you
to lend your support to this amendment to make sure that we’re doing
this in a way that recognizes all of the health and safety issues around
drilling and what will happen to our water sources and</p>

Stone and Representative Boles.  Now I think, clearly, those of us that
understand this issue, and I believe that everybody in this House does,
knows that they represent the area of the state that would be most
directly impacted by hydraulic fracturing.  And I just would like to
observe, as a representative that has watched them as they have handled
this issue very delicately over the three years that I've been here, I
think they've done a wonderful job in representing the counties that
they represent, the districts that they represent.  I too come from an
area that would be directly impacted, and I understand that this is an
issue, one of those issues that seems to elicit very highly emotional
responses from some of the folks out there, with the calls and the
emails and so forth.  But I'm going to support this because I believe,
and I know, that Representative Stone and Representative Boles have
handled this in the right way.  And with that said, Mr. Speaker, I'd
like to ask if Representative Stone would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stone, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I do.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stone, thank you for yielding.  Are
you part or have you ever been a part of any kind of agenda, if you
will, that you believe would harm the citizens of your district?  I'd
just like for you to speak on that for a moment, because I think there
is this feeling out there among some that there's some kind of
underhanded agenda, if you will, that's going to fast track and do all
these things to our state that are going to be harmful for the citizens
of our areas, and I don't think there's anybody here more qualified to
speak on that than you and perhaps Representative Boles.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Thank you, Representative Jones, and I do appreciate the
question.  We've been committed from day one.  We never said that we
would enact natural gas exploration tomorrow, we said we'd have the best
bill in the nation.  And I was encouraged by that, from Representative
Gillespie when he was here.  We were committed to the fact that, as we
moved forward, we'd make sure we did it in a sound way and protect our
environment and our water.  I've lived in Lee County my whole life, and
this is a big issue in Lee County.  And as one newspaper said, if
natural gas exploration takes place, it'll take place in Lee County.
And our citizens are as concerned as anyone in the state.  It is a huge
issue.  But I want to assure you, as we move forward, that I'm looking
to make sure that we move this process in the right way so that my kids
can grow up and feel proud that their dad was part of this, and to make
sure that the people in my community know that they were put first in
this, foremost.  We've done a lot of research, more so than I ever
thought we would be involved in, and I'll tell you that there's a lot of
information and there's a lot of wrong information.  The Mining and
Energy Commission that Representative Gillespie was a big part of, set
up, it was having over 100 people attend those meetings in the
beginning.  It's down to 15 or 16.  It's actually winning people over.
It's showing folks that we can move in the right direction and we have a
variety of ideas at the table.  So I'm excited about this today and as
we move forward, and we do have a journey to go.  And I thank the
leadership for letting me be part of this, and I want to assure again
that our community and the people of the state of North Carolina are the
first most important thing.  Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, Mr. Chair.  I'd like to be recorded as voting no on the
amendment.  I had a problem with my finger and the button.  [SPEAKER

the Harrison amendment.  Representative Jones, please state your
purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'd like to ask if Representative Boles
would submit to a question.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Boles,
does the gentleman yield?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, sir.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  The gentleman yields.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you,
Representative Boles, and I assume you heard the question I just posed
to Representative Stone, and I would like to give you the same courtesy,
if you would, if you'd like to add to anything to what he said.  I have
admired the way that you and Representative Stone have handled this
delicate issue over the past three years that I've been aware of and
just ask if you'd like to comment on that same question, if you would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I would, and I would like to say that I was not born
in Moore County, but I've been there my whole life, and that, first of
all, I would like to thank the Speaker's office for their support, and
the staff that we have here in the General Assembly.  We were assured
that nothing would be fast tracked.  We were assured by this body that
we would have, that the voters, that this body would come back and vote

??minutes on the hydraulic fracturing.  And I can assure you that the
speaker’s staff has assured Mike and I, Representative Stone and I that
would happen.  I have family in Moore County.  My children are in Moore
County.  I have businesses both in Moore County and in Lee County.  As
you all know I am in the funeral business, and first of all, part of
that is trust by families.  And I can assure you, I would not do
anything to have put my community in an environmental situation that I
could not defend.  With that said, I think, as Representative Stone said
we did not promise the state, the community or the industry that we
would have a fast bill, but we would have the best bill.  In with that,
I will tell you people come to my office all the time.  They were
concerned.  I was very concerned in this particular bill that came over
from the Senate, about the Landman Registry wanted to be taken out.
People call me at home, should I go ahead and sign a lease?  Should I do
this?  And they trust me, and I tell them to just hold off, because the
rules are not in place yet.  And I feel very confident with the mining
commission board that we have.  These are great and well educated people
that are putting together this bill.  As Mike said, they started out
with a hundred people attending the meetings. Now there are less than
fifteen or so because they see the competency.  And I would also just
once again like to speak highly about our staff that we have here at the
General Assembly with Jennifer McGinnis here.  Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate the fact that the bill was
corrected to make sure that any actions that are taken going forward
will come back before this body for approval before we go forward.  You
might recall that I was one of the people who on several occasions
brought that point forward.  That we need to ensure we don’t have these
actions being taken just because there was not a meeting of the
committee and therefore, whatever is proposed goes forward.    So I
appreciate the fact that one safeguard is in the bill. Regarding who is
going to be affected by these polluted waters and our failure to take as
much precaution as we can in advance, we do not get a do-over.  And we
know it’s going to cost us many times more to try to clean or rehab this
water if it’s not properly handled and contaminates our water table and
our other water.  It’s the one resource that we cannot afford to have
polluted because so many of us depend on it.  Again, who’s going to be
affected in the state also is partially depended upon how and where we
dispose of this contaminated water.  I want to just emphasize that
although Representative Moore, Representative Boles’s county and
Representative Stone’s county may be ground zero for this, and I do not
use the term ground zero lightly.  Durham County is likely to be
affected by this as well.  And we already have serious water concerns
and want to be protected and want to make sure every step is taken to
ensure that the water table and water supplies are preserved and
protected.  And don’t want to have to incur the additional expense of
possibly having to come back later and clean or rehab that water and try
and clean the environment.  So, I am going to ask you vote against the
bill at this time.  Let’s go back and put sufficient protections in
place.  So we know that issue will be addressed and will protect all
North Carolinians and our future and our children’s future.  Thank you.

I also represent that area that will be immediately impacted, because I
represent part of Lee County and all of Chatham County.   Representative
Stone admitted that he had many citizens that expressed concerns about
this.  Based on my emails he may be underestimating those numbers,
because I have very many who are very concerned about this.  Both in
Chatham and Lee.</p>

specifically, a state law currently allows sixty days to file a
permanent appeal with the office of administrative hearings and the
clock begins to run. soon his dinner provides notice of the permit
decision. I also know I know that those comments can be appealed by a

donuts. The members may eat. Representative McNeill, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t mind competing with donuts one bit. Before
anybody asks why I’m standing up, I represent a large portion of Moore
County land wise. And my constituents will be definitely impacted by
this bill. Although I was not born in Moore County, my grandparents are
from Moore County, lived in Moore County. They both lived their lives
there and died there. My father and all his siblings were born in Moore
County. So I have a vested interest in Moore County.
I know the Deaner’s Study has already been mentioned here, that it was a
400 page study. But I’ll take you to what the executive summary of that
study says, and this is Deaner’s words, conclusions and recommendations.
After reviewing other studies and experiences in oil and gas producing
states, Deaner believes that hydraulic fracturing can be done safely, as
long as the right protections are in place. It will be important to have
these measures in place before issuing permits for hydraulic fracturing
in North Carolina shale formations.
I believe this bill does that. I thought we loved study bills here in
this House, and that’s basically what this is. This bill does allow
anything to go forward, too, but it has a lot of studies in it. And if
I’m elected again, I assure you, in 2015 when this comes back before
this House, if I don’t feel like it is a good bill. If I don’t feel like
the safeguards that need to be in it are in it, I will vote against it.
But I think it is a good bill. I think it is good to go forward and
study this issue. It is a very important issue for this state. And I
think it can be done and it can be done safely with the right
protections in place. I plan to vote for it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a bill that truly could impact the future of
our entire state. I represented McDowell County and the Catawba River
Basin in the droughts of 2004. We also had the floods of 2004. So I know
there’s a lot of water issues that can change in a district in a few
months period. But we drained Lake James down to the run of the river in
that drought. Our water tables went down in the Catawba River Basin
where wells were drying up everywhere.
Our groundwater is extremely important in my region of the country. We
have set about after that drought, doing a study on the aquifers and
underground water resources of this state. They are extremely important
to the futures of our communities. And whatever we do, we do not need to
rush ahead.
My concern about getting too far is how much expertise do we really have
in North Carolina? We have not done this before, and we need to learn
from states and communities that have. So we need to take a lot of
precaution and understand this.
Representative Pittman said that he had seen on TV a story where 18
studies said there was no water contamination from underground fracking.
 I hope he would share those resources, because those are certainly not
the resources I am reading and hearing from. If members…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the chair. Would it be possible to ask the
donut eaters to quiet it down? Seriously, I cannot hear Representative
Queen’s remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair has hit the gavel. The members will please
enjoy their donuts in silence. The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again I just urge the members
to challenge their sources of information, wait for credible studies…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to know if Representative Queen will yield
for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Queen have you read the
Buffalo, University of Buffalo Report on marcellus shale?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have not, Mr. …</p>

Speaker : If you have read the Inter-study on Marshall Cell ? ]in North
Carolina?
Speaker changes: I have not, Mr. MCmere.
Speaker changes: The gentleman here, you?
Speaker changes: Have you read the EPA report on the prevailing [chair?]
Speaker changes: I have not.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr.
Speaker changes: Gentlemen
Speaker changes: There is a library over at the states that I visited a
few weeks ago, that  astounded me how many I have not read.[sounds in
the background] but what  I do know [laughter in the background]is that
[xFranklin?] uses poisons to extract natural gas and they dump it in the
ground , it goes somewhere, I got that much straight. So in a way I just
couldn’t resist challenging the sources of information and the level of
expertise that we want to trust when we start down the road to the
plausible solution of an absolutely essential resource water. And ground
water more than any other is important to North Carolina so I urge your
caution even if you could [x afford?] this,  I urge your open minded
attention to the studies and the sources of information that are helping
us understand this issue as we go forward. Thank you.
Speaker changes: Representative Storm, please take your papers.
Speaker changes: Debate the bill?
Speaker changes: The gentleman is reckoning us.
Speaker changes: Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, as I sit here today
and I hear all the concern, I talked to a number of you and you think
sincerely some of you are just opposed to natural gas as xxx. And I
respect that; I can understand that. Though we made a decision as a body
of moving forward, of pushing forward given the information, today’s
sitting, those 76 the House is touched may I add? I have done a number
good things, it’s in the number of these questionable number  to come
back would pull the bait from the Managing Energy Commission. And
Representative Conney , let the Managing Energy Commission do the work
of the bait. We will have a bill relating to natural gas as extraction
or two, every year, even beyond 2015, this is a huge task to take on in
the state of North Carolina. I don’t think anyone really thought how big
a task it is. The part of that has that  xxx study groups come back with
the information. We have got   changes, we have a lot of information
that they have already gathered just waiting for us to act on. So we are
moving North Carolina in the right direction. I understand that we have
got some kind out there, we also understand to protect our community
.See those 76 does exactly that.  Controversial piece of the day, is
certainty. It reminds folks we are all moving 14500 every day is our
planning. We certainly could make   or may be xx would come back any
given time they debated forever. So we have to have a day, we have to
have a beginning and an end. I want to remind you it still goes back for
a final decision . These are the studies really, really important as we
move forward, we should know how to charge the right service tax, so we
to make sure our local communities are involved in that and impacted,
this is part of the process. This is going to be taking place over the
next several years as we move forward. So I ask you today to vote in
favor of Clinical 76, unless   the new bill is going to become the
fourth as we move the North Carolina in future to be part of the
independence and after asking you to vote for this bill.
Speaker changes: Representative Collins.
Speaker changes: Why?
Speaker changes:   the bill.
Speaker changes:  you may proceed.
Speaker changes : A lot of comments, a lot of fears and other things
being expressed here.  One person mentioned that we may not have the
expertise in North Carolina to do this; may be that is one reason that
the people who are promoting this move towards extraction of natural
gas, most House members and Senate members have visited multiple  states
to find out how the states that have been doing this for decades are
doing it. This is not something we just came up with and haven’t
investigated. Also it has been mentioned that we need to pay attention
to studies. In fact, I have read some of the studies I might seek
counsel because he is</p>

force me to do that early on. And I would say that we do make our
decisions based on studies rather than on emails of people who have been
scared into something by whatever activist group has gotten a petition
to them or whatever. It's interesting to me that the people who are
supporting this, and the people are running with it have looked at
multiple studies and read them and, again, have visited onsite locations
where this is actually going on. I happen to know and be a very a good
friend with one of the Senators who sponsored the bill, and I would say
to you across the aisle, you want a go-slow approach, then you should
like this bill as it's currently constructed. My Senator buddy, I think
the word he used the other day when I had lunch with them was “gutted.”
His bill has been gutted as far as he's concerned. So if you like a
conservative, go-slow, let's not jump into this thing approach, you
should like Senate Bill 76 in its current form. I'll simply say if we're
gonna react in fear to everything that might possibly happen regardless
of what the studies say, and admittedly some have already admitted they
haven't read any of them, then, you know, we'd still be riding a horse
and buggy today and not have automobiles and airplanes and a lot of
other things that we've had if we were just gonna do away with even
considering something because it might have some type of harmful effect,
but we're not sure and we're not willing to read studies or anything to
find out, but it might happen. Therefore we're not gonna do it. You
know, I don't want to take the Chicken Little approach to economic
prosperity or anything else in North Carolina. I love the environment as
much as anybody. I've lived in this state all my life, but I have read
some of those studies that show that this can be done properly so that
it doesn't destroy our drinking water. Again, the current vision of --
the current version of Senate Bill 76 is a go-slow approach, and I would
ask that you support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Jones, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I will try to brief, you
know. Sometimes when we get debating these issues on the floor, I think
that maybe people say things that they don't exactly mean or the way
that it sounds. A little while ago, my friend Rep. Carney, and I have
great respect for her and she's not one that generally makes remarks
that I would deem to be inflammatory. But she said perhaps in a future
election there might be people running for this office that care about
water. And I don't believe that she meant to imply that the people who
are voting yes on this bill today don't care about water. I want to
state for the record that I care very much about water, and I believe
that my colleagues that will vote yes care very much about water as
well. I'm a loyal guy. I like Rep. Pittman, and I'm not only a native
North Carolinian, but I'm a native of my home county. My family and
drink from a well. My neighbors do the same. Many people that I
represent do. Our county and our area of the state will be impacted by
hydraulic fracturing. It's been said that this is somehow changing
things, breaking as promise that was made, putting this on a fast-track.
When I read the date on this bill, it says March 1, 2015. It's almost
two years away. That's what was said to start with -- 2015. And unless
I'm mistaken, I believe the General Assembly will be back here for the
short session in 2014. Changes can be made if needed. I think this is
entirely consistent with what was said and what was done last year. And,
ladies and gentlemen, we're all here as representatives, and I
understand that we represent different constituents, different
districts, different areas of the state, and you're here not only to
vote your own conscience but to represent the people that you were
elected to represent, and I respect you whether you vote yes or no on
this bill. And I do believe that you care about water. I'll tell you
that in the last election, my political opponents hammered me about this
particular issue. It was one of the main issues that was put out there
to hammer me. Sixty-four percent of the people in my county agree that
apparently overall I was doing the right thing. Maybe you might argue
they would disagree on this issue. But I will tell you it was first and
foremost an issue that my political opponents wanted to use in
categorizing me in my last campaign. As a speaker, I believe Rep. Stone
said I understand there are people that seem to in our society oppose
any efforts for energy exploration. I don't see too many opponents to
energy use. They seem to be perfectly happy with us continuing to buy to
our energy [CUTS OFF]</p>

From [opac] or wherever else. Also heard a comment earlier that maybe we
need to learn from other states and other areas that have done it. Well,
ladies and gentlemen, we’ve got about 66 years that we can look at that
people have been doing this. And I do deal with facts, not rhetoric and
I know that this is an issue that many on the left in particular and
many in the media oppose and I can assure you if there were some
confirmed studies out there where people’s drinking water had been
poisoned because of hydraulic fracturing, it would be hanging from every
rooftop, it would be in every media, it would be in every magazine,
every newspaper, every television station. We would know it very well
and I haven’t seen those facts yet. So, for that reason I will vote Yes
today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the House is the passage of the
House committee substitute to Senate Bill 76 on its second reading. All
in favor, vote Aye. All opposed, vote No. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 68 having voted in the
affirmative and 33 in the negative, the House committee substitute to
Senate Bill 76 has passed its second reading and without objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised, the bill will be taken
up for third reading on Monday evening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A motion with respect to the calendar page 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, the motion is to re-calendar Senate Bill
325, short title. “Wake County School Board Districts” for Monday but
with a short explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to explain the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The explanation is that a couple of members of the
Wake delegation have to be absent today and would like to vote on this
but the delegation has agreed that if we re-calendar for Monday, there
would be no objection the third reading from them. And I would just
enquire if anyone else would object the third reading Monday if we were
to accede to this request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not knowing whether or not this has been known to the
minority leader beforehand. Representative Hollo, I don’t wanna put you
on the spot but I do have a question regarding the apparent commitment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don’t know what the
commitments were made from, of course the Wake County delegation but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] From the wake county delegation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] From the wake county delegation, if they made that
commitment, that’s fine but I do know we have members who are not here
today. They may wanna put some objection forward but certainly we’ll
poll with them and proceed with Wake County’s desires if that’s what
they wanna do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and Gentlemen, just as a technical matter with
the objection on third reading for Senate Bill 76 and a bill we’re about
to take up on tax reform that I expect lengthy debate, it is the intent
of the chair to have both those bills as well as the Wake County bill
voted out on Monday night. If there’s objection to the Wake County bill
on Monday night, we will recess or we will adjourn at midnight and we’ll
start the Tuesday session or we will adjourn at 11:30 or whatever time
we complete the debate and we will come back just after midnight to
dispense with that because the Tuesday calendar is absolutely essential
that it stay open for appropriations so that the effect of objecting to
that on a third reading will be a midnight session. Representative
Jackson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess, to speak on the gentleman’s motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was the one that made that
representation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was the one that made that representation to
Representative Stam that we would not object on third reading. However,
I’d like to inform the body the details of that representation. It was
made yesterday. My eleven year old son had elementary school graduation
this morning at 10 AM and I really wanted to go to that but I couldn’t
get any response. So, I’m here. So, I came and when I made that
representation that I wouldn’t object, that was in order so I could make
something that day. I don’t plan to object on Monday night, but I would
like the opportunity to be heard at that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill will be debated fully and to the extent, any
member wishes to, on Monday night. But, again, with all due respect to
the members, Tuesday has to be freed up to complete the budget and.</p>

Representative Lewis state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may debate the bill and in the process of debate the
gentleman may have staff available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House thank you for
the chance to speak to you today on House Bill 998. Tax reform is not an
event it is a process. The Tax Simplification and Reduction Act is
another important step forward in reforming North Carolina’s outdated
tax system.
We are continuing the work we started by reforming a broken Worker’s
Compensation system, curbing frivolous lawsuits, reforming our
unemployment tax structure, repealing the death tax and instituting more
than a billion dollars in tax cuts during the last budget cycle.
This plan puts North Carolina on track for further tax reform efforts.
It’s a major step forward in the ongoing process and long overdue need
to address tax reform. It begins the important process of repealing tax
loopholes and preferential tax treatments.
Under this plan that you have before you, the working families of North
Carolina will have more dollars in their pocket and our state will
become more competitive for job creation. For those who are interested,
The Tax Foundation predicts that implementation of this plan would take
North Carolina’s tax ranking from seventh worst to 19th best tax climate
in the nation.
Under this plan two-thirds of North Carolina tax filers will see an
average personal income reduction if 20 percent. This plan cuts personal
income taxes for each and every citizen who pays them in our state. It
creates a flat, fair, 5.9 percent tax rate making us competitive in the
Southeast and in the nation.
It helps low and middle income earners by doubling the size of the
standard deductions. The most vulnerable North Carolinians will retain
an effective zero percent personal income tax rate and North Carolina
will continue to have one of the most generous standard deductions in
the country.
It more than doubles the child credit for low and middle income North
Carolinians by increasing it from 100 to $250 per dependent. It protects
senior citizens and families by keeping important exemptions in place.</p>

plan does not tax Social security. This plan keeps deductions for
mortgage, interest and property tax. And it allows deductions for
charitable contributions. This plan cuts business taxes by  more than
900  million over the next 5 years. It cuts the franchise tax. And as I
said it keeps its central items from having imposed upon them the state
sales tax rate. Food and medicine would not be taxed under this plan
that is before you now. We do expand the sales tax base. But we expand
it in areas where it is already been collected, remitted and the record
keeping in place.
Speaker changes.
There is going to be a lot of debate later today. About this plan much
of it that I have heard, I would like to speak to, now and perhaps save
a bit of time in a revotal process. First of all I am proud to stand
here and advocate for a flat 5. 9 percent tax rate. I believe that the
current tax system which leaves our state with the highest tax rate in
the Southeast for not just for millionaires. Because you are going to
hear about them later today. But for anybody making over 60.000 dollars
a year. 7.75 percent, the highest rate in the SouthEast. I believe 5.9
percent is a fair rate. It does not penalize those who are trying to
make more and advance themselves in the economic world. I think you will
find, and I can produce chart after chart if that is the direction the
house wants to take. But I want you to know that the crafters of this
plan are acutely aware that there are those in the state who thru hard
work, gifts from God whatever put them in the place that they are in do
have more income than others in this state. We consider that in the
preparation of this plan and I feel confident that this plan will
provide tax relief. And leave more  money in the pockets of hardworking
families. Of hardworking North Carolinians. I will respectfully ask for
your support on this vote today. To my knowledge this is the first time
and overall of this size has been actually debated on the floor of this
house in most of our lifetimes. What we are about to do today is a good
step forward. It is a good step forward that helps the people in this
state. It helps those that are here now. It helps attract others that
might want to come in and create more jobs. I respectfully ask for your
support of house bill 998.
Thank you Mr. Speaker
For what purpose does representative Hall arise. ?
Speak on the bill.
Representive Hall right now is the speaker of the bill.
Speaker changes.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the house as well
North Carloliniens who might be listening now. I understand that this is
an effort at tax reform in North Calrolina. And the important thing is
to make sure we have transparency and everyone understands. And we have
heard this and in the record from our finance commitee meetings as well.
Tax reform has happen in several bills since we have been in session.
And I raised the objection then and I am raising the point in your
memory now. You may recall we raised the tax on 990.000 North
Carolinians when we removed the earned income tax credit from there
bill.</p>

<p id="095:00">
And these are the working families of North Carolina, and at the time I
raised the objection in Finance Committee and when the bill came to the
floor, and I said then “We’re doing tax reform right now.” The response
was “Well we’ll consider it later on when we do the comprehensive tax
reform.” I said “No, you’re changing the baseline, you’re exempting
people from relief and raising their taxes; this is not fair,” and again
the response was “We’ll consider it later on.” Those 990 thousand North
Carolinians who got a tax increase when we removed the earned income tax
credit, they were supposed to be able to be considered and have that
considered for them when this comprehensive tax reform was done. You’ll
notice you didn’t hear Representative Lewis mention earned income tax
credit, didn’t mention those 990 thousand North Carolinians, didn’t
mention the previous promises, although not made by him individually but
made regarding the passing of the earned income tax credit. So let’s be
clear: We gave 990 thousand North Carolinians a tax increase already
this session, so this is not comprehensive tax reform. Need to lay that
bill down beside this one or on top of this one before we talk about
that. Again we sought to make a modification to the level playing field
when we decided we’d give an estate tax break, taking more money out of
the revenue stream of the state for people who didn’t need it, and maybe
they did need it, but certainly not any more than the working families
who were eligible for that earned income tax credit. So 990 thousand
individuals get a tax increase by removing the earned income tax credit,
and then we decided 23 to 25 families would get an estate tax exemption
for their estates worth over five million dollars that got transferred
from generation to generation, and so those folks got a heck of a – and
that’s the “h” word; I probably would use a different one, but present
company excepted and knowing that there are fragile minds who are
listening but certainly should be, but that’s a heck of a tax cut right
there, but we reserved that for 23 families in North Carolina. Ya’ll get
the big tax cut. Now remember, we’re supposed to be comprehensive. So
now we come to the comprehensive bill. Do we remember we gave the tax
increase to the 990 working families? No, we don’t remember that. We
don’t even mention it so we can’t say we’re hypocritical. We didn’t
mention it. Do we go back and say “Hey, look: You folks who got that big
tax cut, you 23 individuals who got this 50 million dollar plus tax cut,
we’re going to have to consider that when we do this tax plan now”? You
can’t get two tax cuts. That’s not going to be fair to North
Carolinians. Certainly not going to be fair to the 990 thousand North
Carolinians who got a tax increase, but we don’t mention that either.
We’re all sitting here as if it’s not even raining outside. So now we
say this is comprehensive, this is fair. Well let’s talk about who
benefits under this. It’s a tax increase on 95 percent of North
Carolinians. Those working families, some of them working poor now – and
note we’ve come through two recessions recently, so those folks who
maybe in your mind’s eye are not working poor or working families who
are struggling, they are. They’re your constituents, they’re in your
counties, and your county has suffered as a result of that earned income
tax credit being denied to those 990 thousand North Carolinians.
Representative Lewis said “Well essential items are not going to be
taxed,” and he told you what in the bill sponsor’s mind essential items
were. Food and medicine. I want you to think, are those the only
essential items or items you consider essential in your life and in your
family’s life, or in your constituent’s life. If so, you probably want
to vote for this bill. Yes, this is the first time a bill that overhauls
the tax system to this extent was brought to the floor, but again I
caution you that this is not comprehensive tax reform. We just talked
about those North Carolinians that were given that tax increase, those
990 thousand, this session, and we talked about those that got the 50
million dollar tax cut this session, so to call this comprehensive</p>

I've addressed those two items. I think it's disingenuous on our part,
and certainly not a transparent representation to the people of North
Carolina of what we're doing here. Now I realize I don't have the votes.
It was clear when the Earned Income Tax Credit came forward, and we said
look, don't do this to these working families of North Carolina. They're
struggling. They can barely make it. They need that little money. It's
going to be put back in the economy. All the studies say that is the
best dollar that will be put out there, and it will recirculate in the
community.  It fell on deaf ears. The same thing happened when we said,
you're putting a hole in the budget if you give away the $50 million
dollars to people who don't need it. Then those who need it the most
will have to suffer. And sure enough, this is shifting the tax burden
again so the 1% at the top get the highest benefit under this plan, and
95% of North Carolinians ultimately have a tax increase. I know, and I
understand that people have determined that they can just ignore
virtually a million North Carolinians and say to them, &quot;I know
you're paying more in taxes, but wink wink, you're really getting a tax
cut. I know we've taken the Earned Income Tax Credit away, but wink
wink, you really still have it. I mean, it really is in this
Comprehensive Tax Reform.&quot; So I believe we may be fooling
ourselves, but you're not fooling the person who has to pay more taxes.
You're not fooling those North Carolinians who are working families, who
have to pay more on their taxes because they don't have the Earned
Income Tax Credit. They'll see it when they prepare their taxes. They'll
see it when they pay their taxes.  [Speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, to send forward an amendment. [Speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read [speaker changes]
Representative Hall moves to amend the bill on page 2 lines 8-32 by
rewriting the line to read, [Speaker changes]
Representative Hall, you're recognized to explain your amendment.
[Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. this amendment does two things. And as I spoke
about it, I think they're what we need to do, keeping in mind what shape
our state is in and how battered our economy has been, and how much our
citizens have had to sacrifice and suffer. They spent down. They used up
resources and they're barely hanging on, depending on us. This would
maintain the tax rate at 7.75% for our millionaires and above, something
they're already paying. And it would increase the Earned Income Tax
Credit to 14% from the 5% and again, the 14% is of the federal amount
that they qualify for. It would increase it from the 5% they currently
have, until we pass that last bill. It will increase that to 14% of the
federal, and it would extend this for five years to give us time to
hopefully benefit and move forward in job creation in North Carolina.
I'd ask your support on this. This is revenue neutral to the tax plan.
It will not require any additional revenue calculations to be done. And
I'd ask your support on it. [Speaker changes]
Thank you, Representative Hall.  Representative Blust, for what purpose
do you rise? [Speaker changes]
To debate the amendment [speaker changes]
You're recognized to debate the amendment. [Speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'd like to thank Representative Hall for at
least in the first part of his amendment, acknowledging that tax rate on
North Carolinians on the vast majority of them has been too high, and
endorsing the 5.9%. So I commend and thank him for that. Had I known
about this in advance, I would have done so during my opening remarks.
However, I'm going to ask you to oppose this amendment. You see, as
Representative Hall knows, the tax bill that is before you today -
despite what you may have, depsite the direction I'm certain this debate
will now go - deals with the living. The fact that we have chose not to
tax the dead with the Death Tax, I don't think was really a relevant
lead-up to the introduction of this amendment. Representative Hall, if
he were to be asked - and I did not interrupt his remarks to do this -
he would tell you that the average Earned Income Tax Credit paid out</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Was at 5% of the federal tax credit was at one hundred
dollars, and most of that was a refundable part, which means, since it's
based on the federal tax credit, it's not really a refund entirely of
taxes paid. If this amendment had been based on only a non-refundable
part, it would have been about forty dollars a year. The tax plan you
have before you un-amended, provides, at the twenty thousand dollar a
year level, over forty dollars a year worth of relief. So I would submit
to you, despite the remarks that you heard, the least among us, the
least of these were considered in the comprehensive tax reform bill that
is before you. This amendment which seeks to reinstate the 7.75%, the
highest rate in the South-East, on income, and penalty on success, a
penalty on small business owners. It is not an incentive for people to
want to better themselves, to reach that point. It is not an incentive
to attract businesses to this state. It is not an incentive to help
people move ahead. I would ask you that you join me in defeating this
amendment. Thank you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does representative Hall rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time on
an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized to speak a second
time on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I hope
there is no doubt in anybody's mind that I could probably talk as loud
as Representative Lewis, or even louder, and I don't think that's going
to convince you that my [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Lewis rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry to the chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] State you inquiry. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do I need to offer an apology? Did I speak inappropriately into
the mic? If so, I would like to do that at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think your point is made. Not at this time Representative Lewis.
Proceed Representative Hall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
What I think is important is what we have done here is said, on a
marginal rate, if you were paying 6% on a marginal rate, we move you
down as the working folks in North Carolina, and the working poor, we
move you down to 5.9%. And if you're a million dollars and above, you go
from 7.75 to 5.9%. Then we say, &quot;You're going to have to pay more
for things you need: food and medicine.&quot; Those other categories.
You're going to have to pay more for that , more than your tax break
could be, and you get a tenth of a percentage point versus 7.75 goes
down to a point and a half or more. As a millionaire obviously, you have
thousands of dollars or more to spend for the additional expenses you
have, for the use of these services that are being taxed. Working family
or working poor, what do you have? You've got to have one tenth on the
marginal rate to spend on the same necessities. So, yes, you get a tax
break, except that it costs you more to operate, and you don't have
enough to cover that additional expense. And yes, if you're in that one
percent, and you're getting the greater share of this tax rate, yes, you
have much more to spend on on those expenditures. So, I'm just saying
let's be clear about it. We're giving the majority this tax rate. 95% of
North Carolinians pay more, a few other people pay less, they just
happen to be in that millionaire class. And, if that's what we're doing,
let's go ahead and say it. I think Representative Lewis said it. We
don't want to penalize success. Well, we don't want to penalize our
citizens either, who work hard everyday, many of whom are employed. It
sounded as if there was an implication that anyone who received or
earned income tax credit was unemployed or was avoiding jobs when we had
many more people in North Carolina applying for and qualified for the
jobs that are available than jobs that are available. In some cases, up
to ten and more persons per job opening applying. So, again, let's not</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does representative Blust rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if representative Hall yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, would you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I'd certainly be glad to yield when I am finished.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does not yield at this time, representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I said, let's just be clear. I am all in favor of millionaires, all
the millionaires. I know personally called millionaire and said Hey,
This is a good deal for me. I want you to go ahead and pass it. No,
Obviously I don't know any millionaires personally so I didn't get a
phone call. And the same number called me and said Hey, This is a bad
deal for me and I don't want you to pass it.I live in North Carolina and
leave my fortune in North Carolina. I came here because this is one of
the greatest places in the nation to live, work and do business. You got
the highest average over the last 10 years from size selection magazines
to be a place for businesses come. Your tax situation must be more than
just competitive. You continue to test out that at top. So I certainly
wanna stay here, I am not going anywhere. I am just loving it as it is.
Of course I didn't their call either but as Representative Hager said I
read some articles. I read some studies. I don't know if some of you did
or not. I didn't go over and see state library though. I know I didn't
read everything in there. But we know time after time why this happens.
So again I'd ask that you pass this amendment. Let's have true
comprehensive tax reform. Let's let someone other than the top one
percent to have some legitimate benefit from this bill and it won't
increase the annual revenue that has to be generated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does representative Blust rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall yield now that he has completed his remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does representative Hall yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd be glad to accommodate Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall does yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you representative Hall and I am just wondering because I think
there is an issue in this particular bill that's not getting as much as
attention as it deserves. I have just noticed that some of the common ??
wondering if it would affect your remarks at all if you factored in
what's called the Zero Bracket amount. And do you understand how that
will even more than the 5.9 percent raise which looks like it's down
very slightly from 6 percent but when you figure in the Zero Bracket
amount, the very bottom carves out. An amount that there is no tax rate
applied to at all means the 6 percent currently would be applied to a
much smaller number which means in affect this particular tax plan is
providing a lot more relive to those in 6 percent bracket now then ??.
Appear from first glance, do you understand the zero bracket amount and
would it change your analysis at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The zero bracket amount won't not change my analysis. It won't change
the fact that 95 percent under this bill, 95 percent of North
Carolinians get a tax increase. So you can use whatever analysis you
want for that. Going to very bottom and saying the poorest of these, the
absolute very poors in order to achieve that benefit for us to say that.
That does not change my analysis. 95 percent of North Carolinians are
going to get a tax increase under this and that continues to be the case
even with those the brackets. So I appreciate the fact that the very
poor, the absolute very poors will get some relief. But it still ends up
with 95 percent of North Carolinians getting a tax increase under this
bill and that is just a fact. With those brackets or not, that's what
this bill does.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does representative Blust rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To yield for a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does representative Hall yield? It'd be a pleasure representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, I am having a hard time following where you are
getting your facts to say that 95 percent will get a tax increase when
for merit filing jointly, This bill is taking the first 12 thousand
earned and applying zero tax to it. It differs depending on your filing
status what that zero is but it's not raising the sales tax. Aren't you
engaging in a bit..</p>

<p id="115:00">
?? with not accurate facts to say 95 percent of people are going to get
a tax increase when it is probably maybe not the reverse to that but I
would say more then the majority are going to see taxes lower than to
this bill.
Speaker changes
Well again I am correct. And I m going to take the same standards as
representative of Hager. I have read the studies and articles and I am
going to say this again. So everybody gets it straight and whoever is
going to quote it or write it. 95 percent of North Carolinians are going
to get an tax increase. And you cannot shift the idea, that saying well
just because I am going to charge you less on a margin or rate. But I am
going to charge you more for all your necessities except for food and
medicine. That those taxes don't count as well than the calculations.
So, however you want to try to spin it at the end of the day this 95
percent of North Carolinians that pays these additional taxes they will
know when they keep track. They will know that you have given them this
tax increase for the benefit of folks who do not need it. I am sure many
of them probably did not ask for. I am sure many of them did. We are not
doing a good service to the citizens of North Carolina. Again, I ask
that you support this amendment.
Speaker change
Those members not speaking on this amendment, would you please cut your
light off.
A speaker
Representative Lucas arise
Representative Blast with yield for question
Representative Blast will you yield. I am sure you will when you get
there.
Yes I yield
Representative Blast in your ?? to representative Paul I think I heard
you say that in the bill. That a married couple earning 12.000 Dollars
or less a year would pay no taxes. Is that correct ?
Speaker changes
That is correct. There is absolutely zero tax rate applied to the very.
The first 12.000 of income for a married filing joint taxpayer.
Speaker changes
Second question
Do you happen to have a percentage of couples who are married with a
joint income of 12.000 dollars or less ?
Speaker change
I do not have that before me, but I bet it is a fairly sizable amount.
There are a lot of people in the lower-income levels, just having dealt
with this issue myself and trying to prepare a bill and prepare for
this. And looking at the amount of income that comes from those in the 6
percent bracket looking at cutting that. It is a sizable amount of
income, because there is a whole lot of people that, and I cannot out of
the top of my head tell you what the average income is, but there is a
whole lot of people in those brackets. And this bill, and I don't agree
with everything in this bill. But one of the most salable, one of the
best aspects of it is the zero bracket approach which is also in the
Senator Clodfelter and Senator Hartsell proposal in the senate. So that
is designed to help those  most at the very bottom of the incomescale.
And so many of the analysis that you hear about throwing around are just
not taking that into account in the analysis. And it troubles me to hear
somebody say, 95 percent of the people are going to get a tax increase,
when that absolutely is not the case. And you cannot point to me the
provision in the bill that would leave anyone to have a tax increase.
There is a view services, there are additional services that will be
taxed, but for someone to have a tax increase on those, they would have
to have, probably have a fleet of automobiles, a thousand of them that
they have serviced twice a month for a year. To built up that much
income from the additional sales tax base increase to overcome what they
are gaining from the zero tax bracket. So, I do wish and I think that
there is some legitimate criticisms that can be made to the bill. But I
wish we would keep things on a factual basis and to spent some ??
Change Speaker
Representative Collins arise
See if representative Blust will due for question
Representative Blust
I yield
Speaker change
Representative Blast I am not sure what was implied in that last
question, but that 12.000 zero base. Do I understand that does not just
apply for people just making 12.000 dollars or making 20 25, 30 or 40
thousand would still benefit from that is that correct ?
Speaker change
That is right. It is just the first 12.000 for married filing joint. I
think it is 6.000 for individuals. 8.000 for hen of households. That
does not get taxed at all. So that lowers those marge, actually lowers.
the effective rate will be lower.</p>

For what purpose does Representative, I'm sorry, for what purpose does
Representative Brawley arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wonder if
Representative Lewis would yield to a series of questions Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
yield Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis heard the
assertion made earlier that 95% of North Carolinians would receive a tax
increase under the provisions of House Bill 998. I was wondering if
that's true. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, it is not true. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask another question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If one evaluates the bill using octal or hexadecimal
arithmetic does the bill come up with the result as described? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep, for what
purpose does Representative Michaux rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of
inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] State your point of inquiry. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Are we on the amendment or on the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
believe the debate on the amendment was to justify the amendment on
ninety ei-, five percent of North Carolina tax payers would receive a
tax increase. And that was asserted in the debate on the amendment and
that's the issue I'm addressing sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For the time
being we're on the amendment, yes sir. Proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker I apologize. I couldn't hear what he asked. Or maybe I was
breathing too loud to hear it, but could he repeat his. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I asked if. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, proceed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If one did the math for 998 using octal base eight or
hexadecimal base 10 if he would come up with the results that were
proposed in debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that Representative.
It is based on all of the information that we have from our physical
staff that is absolutely not correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any
system of mathematics of which you're aware that would say this bill
would raise taxes on 95% of North Carolinians? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
only body of knowledge that I'm aware of that would make that claim
would be the talking points that have been passed out to fight against
this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that enlightenment. Representative Jones for what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask if Representative Lewis would yield
for question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Lewis. This is, this has to
do with Representative Hall's amendment that would take the marginal tax
rate or, or keep it at 7.75% which is the highest tax rate in the south.
And I wanted to ask you if certain businesses, certain categories of
businesses in this state would be taxed at the individual tax rate,
businesses that we need to create more jobs in this state. Would that be
the case and if you could elaborate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for
that inquiry Representative Jones. The answer, the short answer would be
yes. The longer answer would be that many of the, in fact most of of the
small businesses, the ones who have continued to employ people, not lay
them off, produce good jobs, are organized in such a way as an LLC or an
S-corp. And all of the shown profit that their company makes flows
through directly to their personal income tax statement. Which means
that in effect you would create a great disproportional incentive for
people to want to make money, because as that money because as that
money would flow through to their tax returns, it would be taxed if they
exceeded the million dollar cap that the gentleman from Durham has
proposed. They would be taxed at the highest rate in the sou-, in the
south east. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative
Dollar arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of The House, I sympathize some with my
Democratic colleagues over there who are offering, Representative Hall
who's offering this amendment. They're not accustomed to cutting taxes
so this is uncharted territory. They don't know how to deal with it. But
let me tell you, let me simplify the debate.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is about lowering. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will not yield. At this time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Point of inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose, for what
purpose, for what purpose Representative ?? do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, this ?? from Representative Dollar is not on the
amendment. I would ask Representative Hall's amendment was about earned
income tax credit and holding the millionaires to the old tax rate. And
this discussion that Representative Dollar just had is not at all

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
As I was saying. Guilty dog bar... Anyway.
Let me talk about marginal tax rates. I can simplify this whole debate.
Every forum that I have been to for the last, probably 10, 15 years, a
forum that I was at, that I was a co-presenter with Senator Clodfelter
last year here in Raleigh, we talked about all kinds of tax reform. One
of the top issues for North Carolina is lowering marginal tax rates.
Every forum that I've been to. When I hear Dr. Mike Walden talk, that
everyone recognizes as an expert in this state, one of the things he
talks about North Carolina needs to do, lower the marginal tax rates.
The Hunt issue, of the Hunt Institute for Emerging Issues. A few years
ago, those members who were here, most of the General Assembly, went
over there to the McKimmon Center. The place was stacked full of people,
they had folks from the Feds, they had experts from all across the
country, they had Steve Forbes there, he was sort of the main speaker.
Everybody talked about at or near the top of their list, lower marginal
tax rates. That's what North Carolina needs to do. And that's what this
bill does. This bill lowers the marginal tax rate. It gives us a flat
tax rate. It helps people at the bottom, and it also helps to empower
people who want to invest in North Carolina. People who want to come
here and start businesses, expand businesses. That's what we need. We
need jobs. We know what the past policies have brought. The past
policies brought us record amount to debt in this state, and past
policies brought us unemployment rates higher than the national average.
Now is the time to address the top issue that we know that the experts
on, on almost the entire spectrum that we've heard about for years, they
said lower the marginal tax rates. This is the historic bill to lower
our marginal tax rates, get our economy going. So I recommend you defeat
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].

We are back on the bill.
Representative Collins. For what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Briefly debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You are recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You know, it's interesting to me, I'm astounded too by the 95 percent
figure, because when we looked at numbers that staff had actually
presented of families and individuals, and people of all tax rates and
all income amounts, were actually getting a break and tax decrease by
this bill.
I do understand, however, why some folks might be against tax breaks,
and I understand what the history of North Carolina has been. When I got
to this chamber in 2011, we had just had the General Assembly before us
raise the tax on everybody by adding 1 percent to our sales tax. And
over a lot of, over a lot of crying and dissent, and shouting, and the
sky is going to fall, and everything else, we actually took that 1
percent sales tax off of all the citizens of North Carolina. So I don't
understand why there's such a hoot and holler now about adding sales tax
to some services. Also, the same General Assembly in 2009, when we
weren't in control, put a sur-tax on people's income. In other words,
were going to</p>

We like taxes so much we’re going to tax the tax. And, of course we’re
going to do that on wealthy people who need to be punished because
they’re making so much income. Now how much is so much income that you
need to be paying tax on your tax? $60,000, if you’re a single taxpayer.
You’re making so much money that not only are we going to charge you
income tax, we’re going to charge you tax on your income tax. I was very
proud to be a part of the General Assembly in 2011 that started historic
tax reform by giving our taxpayers the biggest tax break they’d ever
gotten in our history, a $1 billion tax decrease by taking away that one
percent sales tax and by taking away that tax on the tax.
This is another bill which is going to give people tax relief in North
Carolina and that’s why I stand behind it. I do know some millionaires.
Of course, I’m in the financial practice so I deal with people on all
levels.
But some of the millionaires I know, I’ll give you an example. I know a
couple that’s a millionaire. They both worked hard all their lives. One
of them worked in the school system all of the person’s life. The spouse
worked for a phone company all of their life.
But they were smart with their money and saved their money and invested
their money and those people don’t need to be paying income taxes at a
high rate on their savings and on their investments. Those are everyday
people who worked hard and were smart in North Carolina and yet we’ve
penalized those people with the highest income taxes in the Southeast on
the earnings on their income, on the interest they’re paid on their CDs
and that type of thing.
So, we are helping people of all levels by performing this tax decrease.
I was proud to be part of the tax decrease in 2011, I’m proud to be a
part of the tax decrease in 2013 and I firmly support this bill.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to ask the bill sponsor a question.

Does Representative Lewis yield?

Yes, Mr. Speaker, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, if I have 20,000 families in Robeson County that
make say $15,000 a year total household income, and they have let’s say
a 1989 Chevy Cavalier. And they have a lot of mechanical problems with
that vehicle and they have to repeatedly take that vehicle to the shop
and have repairs done, would they be charged a tax to have the
maintenance performed on the car as a part of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that not a tax increase?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative Graham, if you’ll give me a moment, I was trying to
follow along and I’m doing the math on the fly. Just so I can get
further clarification, Mr. Speaker. What was the level of income that
you used sir? I just didn’t hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m just trying to use the average income in my county for a working
family of four, $15,000. And they take their vehicle to the shop and
it’s a $200 charge for that service on that car. How much tax would they
need to pay on that bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we’re going to figure out how much the tax decrease that they
would have gotten on the income tax side would be and then offset that
by what the…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…tax would be on the labor that you have asked about. Because when you
asked your question you said, “Is it a tax increase?” I acknowledge that
there would be tax on the service but since you were obviously referring
to the net tax impact of the bill I think we need a few minutes to
actually do the math to get an honest answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A follow-up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up Representative Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under our present tax structure, Mr. Representative, is that a tax that
we pay currently?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe you asked if they spent $200 on the repair, so I’ll assume you
meant that’s just on the actual labor and not on the parts which is of
course…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, that’s not the parts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…parts are of course, currently taxed. Under the plan that’s before you,
their income tax would fall $900 and they would pay $14 additional tax
on the service. So, quick math would say that they would have a tax
savings of $886.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.</p>

going to cost that person sure I understand what you're asking. I

also went on to tell you that because of this income tax relief as they
would provide that this bill provides that they would receive as saying

...?? tax. The increase that will be coming forth in the electricity tax
is revenue neutral. It all balances out. Because when your air
conditioning breaks down, or you have to run that fan all night on a hot
summer night in an apartment with six people and that's nice. Then you
have you to pay the electricity to do that. That has a major impact on a
lot of our people in the community. So all I'm asking is let's be
moderate. Let's not try to make anything. Let's lower it. I'm not trying
to get the 7.75 from the $1 million people. Let's lower it down to 6.9.
They'll get a break. Let's give a small break or at least continue on
the 5% for the earned income tax credit. And let's neutralize or keep
the same the electricity tax. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Stam arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would Representative Holley yield for one question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holley yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holley, since you weren't here in 2009,
you're a good person to ask this question to, because those of us who
were here, you know, may have to be invested in defending what we did.
But in 2009, there was a $1 billion sales tax increase on every
unemployed person, disabled person, retired person, child, low income
person. What did you think about that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As far as, if you really want to know that truth, that
trade off for the services we were getting at the time for that 1%, that
tax increase, it was well spent money. So I truly believe that that was
well spent money. The services that have been cut as a result of that
tax break are needy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose Representative Glazier arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Holley will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holley yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, Representative.
I just want to follow Representative Stam's question to you. So in 2009,
that came as I recall after the world went into recession and a global
recession, in unprecedented ways since the Great Depression, and isn't
it true, as well at that time, that what was happening was that the
State did in fact have a temporary increase in revenue. But it also had
to cut another $1 billion and a half out of the budget while it was
trying to not end or eliminate basic safety net services and keep the
basic economy of this State going. Would that also be accurate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's accurate. That's what I'm talking about. The
bang for the buck. The value of that dollar. It may have put taking a
dollar out of my pocket, but it helps somebody else. And the loss in
services that we received at that time, to me, were not worth that
slight decrease that was given.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Moore arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, move that the amendment do lie upon the
table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, you've heard to set the motion in the second.
The motion is to allow the Holley Amendment to lie upon the table. We'll
allow the members to return to their seats.
The question before the House is to table the Holley Amendment and for
it to lie upon the table. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no.
The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. The motion to lie
the Holley Amendment on the table passed 33 in the affirmative, 30 in
the negative. The motion passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Luebke arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry.

<p id="145:00">
To ask Representative Louis a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Louis, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis, in your opening remarks, you indicated that the
mortgage interest and property tax deduction had been put back. That's
not quite true, is it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Representative, the
mortgage interest deduction and the property tax deduction is still in
the bill. There's a 2500 cap that is on there which, based on all the
information we have, covers 98% of all those holding mortgages in our
state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, another question, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to get that it was a
25000 dollar cap. That it was capped at 25000.
But my next question, take my neighborhood mechanic who I take to do
certain things to and he goes to dealer or supplier and he buys whatever
materials he needs, whatever equipment he needs, and he pays taxes on
that to the dealer that he buys it from. Now he comes and puts it on my
car. Is he supposed to charge me another tax that he's already paid for
that, or does he put it in his bill and does he then put labor in there?
In other words he's charging me for the parts and the labor, the parts
he's already paid tax on, but the labor he hasn't paid tax on. And what
I'm getting at is that he's not in that stream that already pays taxes
to the state. Am I correct on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Sho, I tried very hard to follow what
you ask of. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I... Let me clarify. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
By all means. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What I'm getting at, Representative
Louis, is that my neighborhood mechanic, I take my car to him and he
replaces the brake pad that he's already bought and paid the tax for.
When he gives me his bill, he doesn't charge, does he charge me the tax
again on there, or does he include the tax in the parts part and keep
the other parts separate? Point I'm getting at is that he's not the
usual tax collector in this situation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He would not
charge you taxes, or the tax would not be paid on the same part twice.
He should have the ability now to go and by the parts which he intends
to resell, and not pay the sales tax to the vendor from whom he buys
them. And then he's supposed assess the sales tax to you now on the
parts when you buy 'em.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I didn't follow your answer on that because if he's bought the
parts and paid the taxes on it when he bought the parts and then he puts
the parts on your car, then he's not, he doesn't collect the sales tax
from you on that part he's put on your car. 'Cause he's already paid. I
mean he gets it back, but he doesn't have to pay it to the state, does
he? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Under the scenario you said, Representative Sho,
he would have already paid the sales tax due on the parts at the point
where he bought the parts, so there'd be no change in that regard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The point I'm getting at, Representative Louis, is the fact
that he is not in that mainstream that sits out there normally collects
taxes and remits them to the state. And what you're gonna do is charge
him for his services. Is that not correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Sho, I have relayed to you on the floor what I believe to
be the current law, which is, he has the ability not to remit the tax at
the time he buys the part. And to charge you the, if he makes that
choice, he would then collect and remit the tax from you at the time
that you did the repair. if he elects, for some reason, not to do that,
he would still have the obligation to tax the labor that he performed.
But I'm really not sure that's how ?? operates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr... To ask him another.</p>

<p id="150:00">
Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] The other question, because I want to speak on that
other part. What I'm looking at right now, this year, in this year's tax
rate, I think the amount is going to be about 302 million dollars. Am I
correct on that?
[Speaker Changes] Representative Mashogue, are you asking what the total
impact to Ovala big penalty is?
Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] No sir, you're not correct.
[Speaker Changes] May I ask another question?
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] How much is it?
[Speaker Changes] The entire impact for the two year cycle, which is
what I have before me––I'll be glad to try and get this for you once we
adjourn. The entire impact on Ovala big penalty for the two years is a
negative 302.3 million over two years.
[Speaker Changes] I'm sorry. But it is 302 million over the biennial?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] Could I speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Speak on the bill, yes sir, you're recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentlemen, the only thing I was trying to
do in this instance of where you're beginning to charge a sales tax for
labor, you've got your neighborhood mechanic who's out there who you
take your car –– now I'm not talking about Leaf BMW or any of the
dealers, I'm talking about just the actual neighborhood mechanic, the
guy who sits at the service station, who buys a car from Leaf dealer,
from Leaf, and pays the tax. And he comes and he's not in the mainstream
of collecting taxes for the state. But what you're going to make him do,
is you're going to make him get in the mainstream by making him charge a
tax on the labor that he does on that. Now two problems arise there.
Number one, you're going to make a lot of crooks out of a lot of people.
And number two, you haven't put enough money in there for the Department
of Revenue to go around and inspect all of these folks who do this, in
order to try to catch them in those sales tax situations. The other part
of it is, the 302 million dollars I may have inadvertently stated the
question to you, but it was –– the 302 million is for the biennial.
That's 302 million dollars that's being taken out of our availability
for the biennial that could go for a lot of things, could take care of
maybe a little bit of a raise for teachers, a little bit of help in
those folks who are receiving services on medicaid, a little bit of a
raise for state employees. 302 million dollars can go a long ways toward
alleviating a lot of the problems that we have already created in this
session.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does Representative Collins rise?
[Speaker Changes] To see if Representative Mashogue would yield to a
question?
[Speaker Changes] I'd be happy to Representative Collins.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Mashogue does yield.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Mashogue, can you tell me where I can
go to these repair shops that don't charge us any sales tax on parts?
Because I've never been to one in my life?
[Speaker Changes] Well, if you don't have a neighborhood mechanic –– If
you take your car to a dealership, yes. You have never been to a
neighborhood mechanic. But I have. I've been to a neighborhood mechanic
who will replace my brake pads. I've been to Jiffy Lube, for instance,
who's put in a new wiper, who's already paid tax for that. Yeah, I've
been to those people. Not to –– I don't expect that. I'm just talking
about the other one. But anyway, let me get back to the 302. The 302
million, folks, would go a long way in alleviating some of the problems
that we have in keeping up the morale. If you really want to build
morale you buy teachers.... It would go a long ways in keeping teaching
assistants in those grades that we need. It would go a long way in
keeping the cap on class size. Just think about what you're doing. There
are other ways of doing this. I know for a fact that there are loopholes
that can be cut that would greatly enhance what we're doing. But I don't
see any cut in loopholes in here that amount to anything. I guarantee
you you can find at least five billion dollars in loopholes in the
budgets that we are now operating. So I think we just need to go back
and take another look.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does Representative McManus arise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak to the bill and put forth an amendment.
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment.

But I don’t think they're so bad. There are few parts do disturb me.
Every year, we hear of elderly people who die from heat exhaustion in
the summer or from the extreme cold in the winter. We have low income
families dying from the fires or fumes from portable heaters that they
try to use in their homes that are unsafe, all because they couldn’t
afford to heat with electricity or gas. Those people I think, we need to
worry about. My amendment would raise the income tax rate on
millionaires, those earning above $1 million. Now, ?? Representative
Hall said he wasn't lucky enough to know any of those millionaires.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Representative McManus, let one moment for housekeeping. The
clerk will read the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McManus moves to amend the bill on page 2 lines 8 through
32 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, McManus, please proceed and I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s okay. Thank you very much. I do know few of those millionaires.
Some of them live in the very northeastern end of my district and live
in beautiful gated communities and I've been lucky enough to visit a few
of their homes. Now, we keep talking about these poor millionaires who
work so hard and why would we punish them. Now I'm not saying they don’t
work hard, but honestly, I don’t believe they are working nearly as hard
as a lot of our low-income people. They take nice vacations. They live
in very nice houses. They actually go on long trips, go to Europe for
the summer or things like that. They enjoy personal services like
housekeepers and landscaping lawn services. They have nice cars that run
dependably. They have good excellent insurance with medical care…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Collins arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to see if the Representative would yield for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does Representative McManus yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I finish please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then I would…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please proceed, Representative McManus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I have the grudge of these people that I actually would love to
aspire to their lifestyles. They are good people. They have earned their
money. I don’t want to punish them. But most of the ones I know actually
have felt like they've benefited from North Carolina and they don’t mind
doing their part to help North Carolina. I also know people who work
three and four jobs and never go on vacation and struggle to pay for a
lawnmower to mow their lawn-yard and they clean their own house and they
fix their own car and they pray that their children don’t have to go to
the doctor, because that’s one of those little bumps in the road that
they just can't afford. So I would like to offer this amendment to help
with the electrical bills and the tax on those electrical bills. The
current bill that we have before us sets the sales tax on electricity at
7%. Now with the current franchise tax of 3.22 and the sales tax of 3%
that puts our current before the bill, total sales tax, well, total tax
at 6.22%. At the increase to 7%, that’s an increase of 0.78, which is
about $60 million. This amendment would keep the personal income tax
rate for those earning over $1 million and it would reduce the tax on
electricity from – it would leave the franchise tax at 3.22% and lower
the sales tax rate on electricity from 3% to 1.5%, which would save 100
– save North Carolinians $122 million on their electric bills. Now
taking that from where we are now to where that would put us, it would
be a total savings of $182 million on electrical bills for North
Carolinians. So I would like to put forward this amendment and I would
ask for your support.

[Speaker changes.] Speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] You're recognized to speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker and Members of the House, I
wanna just say first on these amendments, I don't know what the
leadership is afraid of. We have two amendments primarily about
restoring the Earned Income Tax Credit, one at a way to really help the
working poor, another to save...
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does Representative Jeter arise?
[Speaker changes.] For speaker of the Chair?///?!?#@?!?@#?
[Speaker changes.] State the inquiry.
[Speaker changes.] Is the gentleman debating the bill or is he debating
amendments that aren't in front of us?
[Speaker changes.] He'll get to the bill in a moment, I know.
(Laughter.)Representative Luebke, please continue.
[Speaker changes.] That's...that's exactly right cause Representative
Setzer and I have served one another for a couple decades and we know
each other's styles so we know how it's gonna go.
[Speaker changes.] Absolutely...
[Speaker changes.] And I will say, just thirdly, that  I think it is
particularly unfortunate that the hardwork that Representative McManus
put on her amendment to reduce the electricity tax...that she wasn't
even...there wasn't even a rejoinder to it. Before she could barely sit
down, having explained her amendment, the question was called and I
think that is actually reprehensible. But now, let me get on the bill.
Make no doubt about it, folks, notwithstanding what my friend,
Representative Lewis says or any other supporter of this bill, advocate
for this bill.  This is a millionaire's tax cut bill.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] It is exactly that and I will not yield.
[Speaker changes.] He will not yield, Representative Stam..but thank
you.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Luebke, please continue.
[Speaker changes.] And how do I know that? I'm gonna look at some data
that came from our physical research division. Data that I really
wish...the chairs had put...accompany had put it with the bill so that
all members could've seen the impact of this bill. I have it right here
and I will tell you. All this talk about helping the low income
families, let me tell you what our fiscal research staff tells us...for
a family, married, filing jointly with two children. Break in income
tax?  Forty dollars. Increased sales tax because of the sales tax on
electricity, on automobile repairs that Representative Graham was
referencing...number of other services that are going up...thirty-eight
dollars. Net benefit from this bill?  Members of the House, two dollars.
Oh that's great tax relief for those makin' twenty percent.  Be proud of
that when you go home to your districts and talk about the break you
gave folks making 20,000. Let's look at $40,000. Income tax break? $116.
More sales taxes paid by this family with $40,000. $74. Net break for
this family thanks to the great House Bill 998. $42.  Now I don't think
you can take the family to Appleby's for that. So $42.  Now let me just
jump ahead to tell you why it's...I've just told you why it's not a bill
for working families or the middle class.  In fact, let's get to the
middle class...$100,000...
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does Representative Collins rise?
[Speaker changes.] To see if Representative Luebke would yield for a
question.
[Speaker changes.] I will not yield.
[Speaker changes.] He will not yield. Please proceed.
[Speaker changes.] Let me go to the middle-class family that some would
call the upper-middle class. 100,000..again staff data, I didn't make
these up...staff.  $100,000 income, married, filing jointly with two
children. Income tax cut of $110. Increase on sales taxes due to the
increase on sales tax on services? $130. Net tax increase for a family
making $100,000. $20.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker? Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does Representative Dollar arise?
[Speaker changes.] To see if the Representative will yield for a
question.
[Speaker changes.] I will yield when I'm finished.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Luebke will yield when
he's...everybody probably knows that by now anyhow.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir. ????????????? can continue.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, sir. My point is this. I heard a lot of
folks back and forth on the Hall amendment saying, talking to one
another and saying oh no...now there's nobody in here that's gonna pay
more taxes is there? Absolutely not. You shoulda' looked at your own
staff report...cause your staff report shows you that a family making
$100,000 is, in fact, gonna pay $20 more. Not much. But the fact that
everybody's supposed to get an increase from this wonderful bill, tax
decrease from this wonderful bill is just a bunch of malarkey. And now,
let's go to the millionaires. And why many of us don't think the
millionaires deserve a tax cut. A family making one million dollars.
Income tax change...bahbahbah. Sales tax change...bahbah. Net impact....</p>

<p id="165:00">
This bill for a family making a million dollars, yes. Twelve-thousand
five hundred and twenty three dollars. So you see it is millionaires tax
cut bill because I told you about twenty thousand, fourty thousand,
one-hundred thousand is virtually nothing.
Everyone in this room can agree that this is virtually nothing. Now we
look to a millionaire and and the millionaires get twelve thousand five
hundred and twenty three dollars.
Really none of us can defend that if we call it a peoples bill. David
Luois my friend, this is a millionaires tax cut. And if you don't have
enough information let me give you the last one.
For a family making four million. Whats the net impact, that is to say,
income tax change minus tax sales increases. $62,181. So you're about to
vote on a bill and or pass a bill that provides $62,181.00 dollars for a
family making 4 million a year. Now lets go further.
How many millionaires are there? I checked with staff. There are 8500
tax returns in this state in which incomes, families that have more than
a million dollars taxable, 8500 people.
How much is that a percentage of our taxpayers? 0.20%. Stated
differently how many of us are not millionaires? 99.8%. But you saw
where the bulk of the money is going. $12,000 for a millionaire family.
$62,000 for a four million dollar family.
It comes up to in terms of what we don't have for the services, that
represent Flashiers reference, represent Holly's reference. All those
services you hear about teaching's assistant, fire department, no raises
for teachers apparently .
Point of order.For what purpose does Senator Moore rise?
Mister Speaker, is the gentleman debating a budget that is not on the
floor at this point? Or is the gentleman debating a tax bill that is?
Representative Moore, I'm debating a bill that you can have a budget
without revenue.
Please stick to the bill blueprint. ( Thank you mister speaker). I'm
just saying folks, Those 8500 filers following the data from our staff,
will receive in one year as a consequence of this bill, 290 million
dollars.
NOw I don't want to venture into budget land, but when you think of
budget land into terms of human services or education, k-12, community
colleges or universities.If you think that way. I know I can think of a
lot of good uses for those 290 million dollars. I believe the people of
this state can and I believe that this is just a bill that hurts the
middle class, it helps the millionaires the public should know about it
and we should all vote no.
Thank you, mister speaker.
For what purpose does representative Stan arise?
Does representative Luke yield?
Representative Lukey, I've heard about these millionaires to deserve no
relief, or little relief. Would you explain your vote on Tuesday to give
these millionaires a half billion dollars of tax relief?
This bill. I didn't vote for this bill. I don't understand, you know I
have always voted against this bill. I don't know where your questions
is coming from representative Stan.
Will representative Moore rise?
Thank you representatives and speakers, I think the hour has drawn to a
close for us to finally take action for this but before making a motion
I would like to address a few things.
I think the point that representative Stan was making was from the
gentleman that was voting to make an amendment in committee, would have
in fact given tax breaks to the millionaires but I guess folks are
entiled to change their opinion, even if it is falling a couple days
apart.
I did want to address this, this bill is a tax cut and a couple of
things that the components have failed to mention is.</p>

Have played with, and that is, of course those who pay more taxes or ??
more of a cut because they pay more taxes, that's simple math. But the
things that folks are also now looking at is this tax cut bill helps
everybody. There's some who say maybe it doesn't help the poor enough,
but it will, it helps as much as we can make it do, but also the other
part that's not being talked about is that when we put these tax cut
bills through, it's going to make our state more competitive for new
business, to bring more jobs, so that those who are down on the lower
income rungs right now will hopefully rise up. They'll earn more money.
That's the intent of this bill. This bill is designed to make the state
more competitive, and I want to thank Rep Lewis and the others who spent
so many hours working on this bill and I think this is a great day for
North Carolina and the folks have been waiting for years for it, so with
the motion I'm about to make, hopefully they're not going to have to
wait very much longer if I may be recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

hear from the minority leader and the majority leader not to exceed a
period of 3 minutes or their designated Representative. Representative
Hall Recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. We've heard a lot of information, we've heard it
throughout the process. The fact doesn't change and for those who
warrant details, Representative Loubke broke it down to show you exactly
what those tax increases are and who gets benefit from this bill. Now,
to say that we're helping the working poor or the middle class families,
that's not what this bill does and the staff figures already showed it.
To say that millionaires disproportionately benefit from this, yes that
is the fact. Yes, they're in North Carolina, yes there are 8,500 of
them. But what about the rest of North Carolina, what about the other
millions of North Carolinians who don't get any benefit out of this and
pay those extra taxes. This is a tax increase bill, I don't think that's
what it was represented to be. Nobody stood up and said or will say yes,
this is a tax increase bill unless you're one of the lucky 8,500. We
didn't want to characterize it as the 1%ers bill, but that's almost what
it was. Actually it's the 2%ers bill, but who's going to quibble over
1%. I don't think this is what North Carolinians want. To have the tax
burden shifted to those who can least afford it. To those struggling
families trying to stay in the middle Class and get out of it and then
those who don't need the help. This idea that it's going to create jobs,
again, the facts ??? we have one of those most sought after states for
businesses and companies to come to right now. We are ready on average
1, 2 or 3 over the last ten years where the place people want to come
and do business and that's because we've had this education system and
other entities in the state of North Carolina that support business and
allow them to thrive here, and that's why we have those 8,500
millionaires who are going to benefit from this bill at the expense of
the rest of North Carolinians. So again I'd ask that you vote against
998. Vote for North Carolinians, and vote against 998.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Hall.  For what purpose does Representative
Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, I have served
in the House for almost 20 years now and we have talked about tax reform

<p id="175:00">
And until today, it has been nothing more than just that. Talk. The
Democrats have tried it and were unsuccessful when they controlled both
Chambers of the legislature and the Governor. And now today the
Republicans are fulfilling a promise that we made to the people of this
State. That if you would give and trust us with your vote, we will bring
you meaningful tax reform that will help move us forward as we struggle
with an economy that is transitioning from a manufacturing to services.
And yes we are mired in a recession that proves to be very stubborn and
ending. But we have to look at ways that we can even out the revenue of
this State so that we can eliminate some of the ups and the downs and
the peaks and the lows, so that we can maintain a stable budget to
deliver essential services to the State or to the people that benefit
from those services.
Now what we have done in this tax package is a very, very good step in
the right direction. Under every scenario that I have looked at. Whether
it's a low income person, a moderate income family, or a high income
family, everyone benefits. I don't see any real losers in this tax
package. And that's what the genius of this plan is. We have been able
to put together a plan that everyone benefits from. Who would have
thought, even six months ago, that it was possible to move to a flat tax
rate that lowers the income tax for every tax payer in this State? And
we have done that with this plan.
And yet we've been able to do it in such a way that we enable the
average citizens to maintain their mortgage deduction and their
deductions for property taxes. We have enabled the people of this State
to continue to give to the charities of their choice because we're in
the situation where the State government is having to shrink its budget
and we're asking the private sector to step up to the plate and to do
more. And we've been able to do that by maintaining our charitable
contributions. And the private sector will stand up and do their part.
This is a good plan. It's an historic day and I ask you to join me in
making history by voting yes on this plan. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Now the question before the House is the
passage of House Bill 998 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye,
all opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. House Bill 998 has
passed its second reading by a vote of 72 in the affirmative and 32 in

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to just stand since I spoke last time on this bill, I've had a
number of constituents send me, who are evidently listening in,
assistance on things I hadn't read. So I thought I would share them with
you. And a number of the members hadn't found any studies that had
indicated that fracking contaminated water, so I thought I might share
this with them. This is a study from the Nicholas School of the
Environment over at Duke, the opening paragraph, it's &quot;Methane
Contamination of Drinking Water Accompanying Gas Well Drilling and
Hydraulic Fracturing,&quot; and the opening paragraph is
&quot;Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are
dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying
the Marcellus and Ithaca shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania
and upstate New York, we documented systematic evidence for methane
contamination of drinking water associated with shalegas
extraction.&quot; A second reference: in 2011, EPA found 14
&quot;contaminants of concern&quot;--I'll come back to that phrase--in
11 private wells in Pavillion, Wyoming, in an area of about 250 gas
wells. Benzene was found in 50 times safe levels along with other
hazardous chemicals--methane, diesel fuel, heavy metals--in both ground
water and deep wells. Third reference: a Congressional report estimated
that fracking fluids, and I will say this, fracking fluids have been
somehow exempted from being identified as proprietary information, so
it's a little hard to know what these companies pump in the ground in
the way of poisons because their lobbyists have managed to keep that
from the public information. But the Congressional report estimates that
fracking fluids contain as many as 29 known or suspected carcinogens,
including benzene and lead. A New York State study found that companies
injected 10.2 million gallons of water with at least one of these known
carcinogens between 2005 and 2009. So that's just a few references to
start with. Thank you. I hope you'll vote no on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 76, as amended. All in favor vote aye. All

Of course, as you know, the Appropriations Subcommittees that didn’t
finish this morning will be going in according to their schedule this
afternoon and completing their work. Full appropriations which we
anticipate will probably take up most if not all of Tuesday will begin
at 8:30 Tuesday morning in 643, so be prepared for it.
We’ll have the instructions and the like at that time. We’ll probably
set the normal time of noon on Tuesday for amendments to be brought to
the staff for drafting. So, 8:30 Tuesday morning we’ll have full
appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, the Chair had an inquiry from the Minority Leader

Thank you for the question, Representative Blust. I would guess that it
would be prudent for us to plan on a 10 or 11 o’clock start on Wednesday
and Thursday so we can do our best to get rooms available so you can
have committee meetings earlier. But I do intend Session will start
earlier. It may still go late even at that. Representative McElraft,

That will be the…Let me try to clarify. We anticipate that the full
budget bill will be online sometime, probably late Sunday night. When
that full bill is released obviously it will be available on Monday. We
have to account for the time to print, but that document is the document
from which you would develop amendments for full appropriations on
Tuesday.

Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So are we going to take amendments at 8:30 or are you saying that
amendments will stop at 12 noon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What normally happens is when we come in and start the meeting at 8:30
on Tuesday morning, we will have reports from the subject areas from the
sub-chairs. Once those reports are complete, we would begin the process
of considering amendments.
Some people will have their amendments ready, that’s sort of the normal
course. Other people will be working. But we will have a noon cutoff for
amendments to be logged with physical staff for drafting.

Well, let me – I understand, I think I understand your question. And
it’s a good point for those who don’t know. Amendments have to be within
the particular subject area. In other words, you can't want funds for
Health and Human Services and go over to education and get that money.
It can only be within and this is by the rules of the House that have
been adopted by this chamber. They have to be in that subject area and
everything has to balance within that subject area. If you want funds
for some project, you got to find where it’s going to come from within
that subject area.
