  <p id="00:00">
  Sargent, there we go, that’s on. Correct? Very good. Welcome to the
meeting this morning, and let me introduce our Sergeants at Arms. We
have Donna Blake and Hal Roach. Appreciate your service and over here if
you’ll—pages if you’ll raise your hands as we call your name. Annabelle
Webb, Sen. Bryant. Colin Miller, Sen. Van Duyn. Kayla Childress, Sen.
Brown. Martha Bland, Sen. Meredith. Adele Patton, Sen. Berrger. And
Hannah Ross, Sen. Hartselll. Thank you very much for your time here
today, and there will one change to our calendar. What we’re going to be
doing is changing the order slightly. We’re going to be moving Senate
Bill 279 to the end. It will bat third. So we’ll go 298, 315, 279. So
without any further ado, we have Senate Bill 298, school bus camera,
civil penalties. And I believe Sen. Pate will be explaining. Is that
correct? Sen. Alexander? Sen. Alexander, you have the floor to explain
your bill.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Senator McInnis and I are going to be doing this
together. He is to be the first presenter, sir.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Go right ahead.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and fellow members of
the—
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; I’m sorry, before we get started, I’ll need a
motion to adopt the PCS. I see Sen. Robinson. All in favor to adopt the
PCS, say aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it, and PCS is before us.
Please explain, go ahead.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you Mr. Chair and members of the
committee. This is Senate Bill 298, school bus cameras, civil penalties,
and the gist of it is every day in North Carolina, we have school
carrying the precious commodity that we own, the future leaders and
members of our families and friends, on school buses, and we have a
segment of the population that decides it is ok to pass a stopped school
bus, with the stop arm out, which is a very dangerous situation, and
this is a bill that we have brought forth, that will cause a civil
penalty to be generated from a picture of the license plate, the license
plate picture will be generated by a sender that will put these on at no
cost to the schools. They will be working for a percentage of the
receipts, and pretty much self-explanatory from that standpoint. Three
ways that they can participate, it is not an unfunded mandate, so there
is no cost to the schools. They can voluntarily participate or not. So
it’s pretty much a good bill. We think that will save some lives, and
bring some daylight to a situation that has been very dangerous and
going on for some time in our public schools transportation. I’d be glad
to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you very much, and do we have any
questions from the committee?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; I’d like to add that I spoke to the people of
Wake County.
They’ve installed some of these cameras on their school buses. They’ve
recently installed about 16 of them. I talked to the guy this morning.
They’ve got two pictures of somebody in the car, and they’re trying to
prosecute him on a criminal basis. He said they’re going to court for
the second time, and hope it does not get continued again. And when I
mentioned this bill to the people at the school bus garage, they were
just tickled to death that perhaps this thing can happen on a civil
basis, and there are a lot of different things about it. But this is not
mandatory to the schools. If they don’t want to do this, they don’t have
to. And then for some of the smaller schools who may not have quite the
staff to go through and do the RFPs. The DPI is going to be asked to do
that in the next 90 days of this bill being passed. Smaller schools,
LEAs can participate if they choose.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you very much. Do we have any questions
from the committee? I see Sen. Pate.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chair. I certainly support the
bill, but I do hope this camera is of the sharper image than the ones
they use on the toll roads around Raleigh. My son got a bill for $56
last night, and he’s never been on the toll road. His license tags have
not been identified. So I hope this is a better project than that one.

  <p id="05:00">
  if I could answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate, we have seen the simulated demonstration on this, and
because the camera is mounted right on the side of the bus it&#39;s
going to be at such close proximity, and of course, using digital
technology as the ones over on the bypass, they&#39;re up so high,
there&#39;s some logistics there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if you have a spare bus, maybe you can park it out there on the tow
road and we&#39;ll get some truth in what&#39;s going on out there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I saw several hands go up. Let me start with Senator Barringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My question&#39;s been answered. We had
experienced this similar problem with red-light cameras. The timing of
them, the person would be all the way through the light and then
you&#39;d get a bill, and so. But you&#39;ve answered it and it sounds
like this is in real time with good technology and should be able to
really put a stop to some bad behavior. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I saw some hands over here. Senator Davis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. Chair, and to my colleagues, thanks for your presentation. I
did, however, would ask if we could just maybe briefly have staff just
kind of outline the sections, if that would be appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. Staff, could you give us a summary of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So Section 1 of the PCS basically sets out the procedure for the county
to adopt the civil ordinance that would be required in order to collect
the civil penalty. And it, the ordinance that&#39;s adopted, would have
to have a mechanism that provides that the registered owner of the
vehicle is responsible for the violation unless they can furnish some
evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, in the
hands of somebody else. And they&#39;d have to do either an affidavit
stating the name and address of the person who did have the care and
custody and control of the vehicle, or some affidavit saying that the
car had been stolen from them. And they would also not be responsible
for the violation if the notice of the county was tardy in giving the
notice, 90 days after the violation occurred and then they&#39;re
sending the citation. The violation of the civil ordinance would be a
noncriminal violation, a civil penalty of $500. It would not get any
points for drivers license or insurance points for the civil violation.
There must be a process provided to the person to state how they can
challenge it, and so specifics as to that. DMV can&#39;t register any
vehicle for the owner until they&#39;ve paid these penalties, and the
county can go after them, civil action in the nature of a debt. And the
PCS also says that the school buses would have to have these conspicuous
signs on them saying that they have these cameras. Section 2 of the bill
would provide, excuse me, the PCS would provide that local boards may
install and operate these cameras, and then they would have basically
three options. They can install and operate a camera without contracting
with a private vendor, they can just do it themselves; a local board
could enter into a contract with a private vendor on their own ??
according to the general procurement statutes, and the contract length
would be three years; and then the third option would be that upon the
request of one or more local boards, the state Board of Education could
enter into a contract for a state-wide contract or a regional contract
for them. Again, following standard procedures for procurement, with the
maximum length of the contract being three years. And then the local
board of education and board of county commissioners can enter into an
inter-local agreement to just, to sort of effectuate the purpose of the
ordinance and the installation and operation of the cameras. And they
can be used to provide, the photographs and videos that are obtained can
be used to provide investigating law enforcement agencies to use as
evidence in the criminal violation of passing a stopped school bus. And
then Section 3 and 4 make conforming changes in other parts of the
statutes regarding the--not being able to register the car, and that
clarifies that failure to produce a photograph or video from a school
safety camera does not preclude criminal prosecution, that that&#39;s a
separate matter and can be pursued on its own. And that they can, the
civil penalty can be in addition to the criminal, any criminal penalty a
person could face.

  <p id="10:00">
  For violation of the other statute, and then section five of the PCS
would require the courts to make an annual report on the number of
offenses charged and convictions under the criminal statute. Counties
that adopt these civil ordinances have to maintain records of these
non-criminal violations, and then section 6.5 would direct the state
board to develop a contract for use by local boards, and provide
technical assistance to local boards if requested to do so.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; I’m not sure whether ?? has just earned the
oximeter or if Sen. Davis has for asking the question. Thank you for
that thorough explanation of the bill. Sen. Smith, I saw you had a
question.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you to
the senators for bringing this bill forward. I certainly support and
appreciate the fact that it’s not being required of every school system,
because that would be tough in a lot of areas to afford to do that, but
certainly has the option. On the civil penalty, does that go back to the
school system, so that maybe then that will support the maintenance and
purchase of cameras.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; The cameras would be owned by the vendor, and
they would put them on there, and they would be paid a portion of the
$500, then of course the balance, as the constitution of North Carolina
requires, goes to fines and forfeitures of the public schools of that
county.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; I saw a couple questions over here, Sen. Rabin?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; This question might be for staff. I did read the
bill and I can’t find where I understand that the person can be
exculpated if they can prove it wasn’t them driving, but somebody ought
to be paying the penalty for doing that, and so is there a way that we
can work it in. It might be a question for staff, into the bill, an
amendment, maybe, that says once the affidavit or somehow declare, this
person was driving, and get them punished for having done the crime
rather than just letting it go, because it wasn’t the owner.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Question, is that person liable?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Well, I think on sort of thinking about that
question over the past, it is not entirely clear for the PCS as written
how—what the process would be for going after that other person. The
affidavit by the registered owner would certainly provide the name and
address of this other person that they claim is the person who was
driving the car. But then, as you keep pushing that, then—initial read,
I think the ordinance could say something like—then you can go after
this other person. But the statute doesn’t provide for—what if that
person then had a defense, “That wasn’t me, that was my ex-best friend
who claims I’m doing it,” type of thing, so the PCS doesn’t really
address how you would deal with those subsequent people who are now
claiming, “well, it wasn’t me”, so more clarity in that could be
helpful, as to how far down you want to let people keep saying, “It
wasn’t me.”
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; That’s a good question, if the bill’s sponsors
amenable to this, what we could do is a little bit more research if we
need clarifying. That might be something we offer on the Senate floor if
you’re comfortable with that.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Follow up.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Either that or in a subsequent committee, maybe
having an amendment, some way that could adjust that, would be a good
idea. Thank you very much.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; It’s going to Senate J2, so why don’t we work on
that question and we might be able to offer an amendment if it’s
appropriate. I have a question over here. Sen. Bryant?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; I understand the severity of and importance of
preventing people from passing stopped school buses. I’m just wondering,
have we tipped the balance from looking at what’s necessary to prevent
people from passing stopped school buses, to try and raise money, are
people who pass stopped school buses. I only say that mostly because of
the amount of the penalty. I’m thinking about my district. Over 60%, a
high percentage of low-income citizens. Surely if they pass a stopped
school bus, it’s a horrible thing Maybe the first time they even did,
who knows what the reason is. You go to court, somebody hears all that.
Judges have some discretion of how they manage things. This is $500, I
think, unless--

  <p id="15:00">
  I’m missing something. Regardless, I just think that’s a difficult, a
high bar, so that’s one concern and I was going to ask staff are there
any legal standards of applicable in the case law about what level of
fine you can have or for civil penalties any knowledge you have of
anything of that nature.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Staff’s discussing it. If you’ve got some input, you’re welcome to share
it.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Senator, I’m not aware of any case law that would say you could not have
a civil penalty of five hundred dollars. I believe there are places in
the statutes where we have civil penalties in that range. There may be
something that says some cap at some point but I think that this is well
under the range of what has been permitted in other cases.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Follow up, Mr. Chair. I had one other question.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Yes, follow up.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
I just want to lodge that concern for our citizens, even though I think
the violation is egregious. Under interlocal agreements, could staff
explain what might be the purpose of these and how come you might need
those agreements in section 2c?
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
I’m sorry, staff, go ahead.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Well, the language is pretty broad. It’s just that the local boards and
the county commissioners can come up with whatever works for them in
terms of the cost-sharing and reimbursement, I mean, I suppose it would
even let the county tell the school board “do you want to use one of
your people to process this and then you can keep more of the money?” It
really is to just let them work out however it is that they want to
handle this issue.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Senator McInnis, did you have a comment?
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
If I could add to Senator Bryant’s question, in 2013, according to the
North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts, there were four
charges of passing a stopped school bus that caused death in one year.
Four charges. And the number of, Madam Senator, that caused me almost to
fall out of my chair was the survey that was taken of North Carolina
public schools in March of 2014, where they talked about the school
buses participating in this summary was 13,323 school buses were on the
road twice a day. In the morning, there were 1377 people that passed a
stopped school bus with the stop arm out. I’m just appalled at that
number. In the afternoon, it was worse. It was 1735. And again some
little child will pay the supreme sacrifice of walking out in front of
that car and I hear you, I hear you about those folks, but we’ve got to
draw a line in the sand. We’ve got to draw a line in the sand and these
buses will have very prominent signs. This will not be a sneak attack or
a clandestine deal. It’ll be very prominently displayed that this bus
has a camera that will be taking your picture for that purpose. And I
hear you, I hear you, but I think it is such a problem that we need to
address it with a strong and firm hand.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Chairman Tillman.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Chairman, if Senator McInnis will stop talking, I’ll get this bill
through this year. Let me say one thing, this doesn’t cost the school
system a dime. They can take it or not, and it’s going to improve the
safety and it’s going to get people the word out that we’re going to
have cameras on probably most of our buses. What can you lose if you’re
a school system? It’s only for the safety and the well-being of the
children in the bottom line. And I don’t know why we’re spending thirty
minutes talking about something that we’re all going to vote for. I make
a motion for a favorable report.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Thank you, Senator Tillman. I did see a couple hands up if you had a
comment. Senator Curtis or Senator Cook? Senator Curtis.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
I was just wondering, if you could make the argument that speeding is
not as offensive as passing a stopped school bus, so why not give points
on the drivers license?
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Because it’s not a criminal act. We’re going purely as a civil penalty.
That’s not to stop someone, the law enforcement, from taking the
evidence that we gather and going after them criminally. That’s where
the points come in, and anything like that. But this is outside the
purview of that. But again it does not preclude law enforcement from
harvesting that information and taking it to the rules of evidence to
create a criminal violation.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 
Thank you. Senator Cook, did you have a question?

  just a comment, Jerry beat me to it. Wanted to move for a favorable
report. However, I&#39;ll take this opportunity to very quickly say
thank you for bringing this bill. I&#39;ve seen the same statistics you
see. They are appalling. And as to concern for the level of the fine, I
submit that you want to weigh that against the level of the cost of a
funeral.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, thank you. While we do have a motion for a favorable report,
the motion will actually be a favorable to the PCS and unfavorable to
the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s what she said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Thank you. All in favor of that motion, say aye. Opposed, no.
The ayes have it, and this does have a referral to J-II, so we can maybe
work through some of these things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. And next before us we have Senate Bill 315, and this is
Senator Pate, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Please, you&#39;re welcome to explain the bill. And while
he&#39;s coming up we have a PCS, we have a motion to adopt a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman moves. All in favor of the motion, say aye. Opposed, no.
The ayes have it and the PCS is before us so Senator Pate, you have the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I&#39;d also like to thank
Senator Tillman and Senator Van Duyn for sponsoring this bill with me.
In this day of getting kids to put down their iPads and iPhones and to
get out and do some exercise, I think we&#39;re missing a great area of
resources that can be used for that very thing, after school hours. And
that is the playgrounds, the outside playgrounds, of our public schools.
If they&#39;re not used for other purposes after school hours are over,
with certain conditions, they should be open the kids to use for
recreational purposes. After all, the taxpayer&#39;s paid for the
facilities at the beginning. So this bill will allow that to happen. I
know of no opposition to the bill. The PCS addresses some issues that
were brought up, but I think now we have a good bill that should be
acceptable to everyone. The back of my home faces a middle school
playground. It&#39;s a baseball field. On Sunday afternoons, I often see
a father and a son come out to work on pitching and batting skills. The
son&#39;s getting pretty good. But the father, like Senator Tillman, is
not a prospect for the majors any more. But Senator Tillman, with this
bill he can get out and do some more work from the pitcher&#39;s mounds
and get his speed back up to 95 again, but I would appreciate your
support of this bill. I will be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Pate. I saw Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for favorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, we have that motion, let me hold that motion for a moment, we
had a couple other hands. I saw Senator Cook. Did you have a question?
Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I wasn&#39;t sure you were looking at me. Thank you. I&#39;m
just curious. Is there some liability problems or anything?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That has been addressed in the bill. The Boards of Education or any, on
the PCS has been addressed, and I think that has been satisfied from
what I hear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, did you have a question as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to say how important this could be to addressing the
obesity epidemic we face, especially in areas of the state where the
small towns and the counties don&#39;t have money for full-fledged
recreation departments, and to appreciate you for this. And I was going
to make a motion if it hadn&#39;t already been made, but thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do have a motion, and any other further comments or questions? Seeing
none, the motion is for favorable to the PCS, unfavorable to the
original bill. All in favor say aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it and
the motion passes. Thank you, Senator Pate. We do have, our last bill
for this morning is Senate Bill 279, and what we&#39;ll do here is
we&#39;re going to have--Senator Barefoot is going to explain it. We
have had people from the public ask to comment on it. We&#39;re going to
allow that, two minutes per person to comment on it from the public, and
then we&#39;re going to open it up to questions from the Senate. Senator
Barefoot, you are recognized to explain the bill. Do we--this is just a
bill. Go ahead.

  License as a licensed professional counselor associate to applicants
that receive graduate-level training from a nationally accredited
institution of higher education. The current law limits the Board to
only issue licenses to applicants who attended a regionally accredited
institution. Applicants are still subjected to the minimum credit
requirements outlined in the statute but will be able to earn those
credits from a nationally accredited institution. The bill will allow
for more applicants to become licensed while maintaining high entry

All right. Before we have questions from the Senate, I did have an
individual request to comment. And that was you. Go ahead. You are
recognized for two minutes to address this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. Thank you. I haven&#39;t done this before. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please
begin with your name and who you represent. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is
Dr. Katherine Glenn. I am Chair of the North Carolina Board of Licensed
Professional Counselors. I would like to thank you for the opportunity
to speak with you today. I have with me today the Vice Chair of the
North Carolina Board of Licensed Professional Counselors. I have another
Board member with me today. I have former Board members, our legal
counsel, and our Board Administrator as well as a licensed professional
counselor from Pembroke, North Carolina. We appreciate the heavy
responsibilities that you hold as members of the Education Committee,
and we want to provide you with information that we believe will help
you make a more informed decision about this bill. You have a received a
letter from the Board signed by me. It outlines the facts regarding
regional accreditation versus national accreditation and degree
requirements for licensed professional counselors. It is our Board&#39;s
position that this bill presents a threat to the protection of the
citizens of this state. It is this Board&#39;s main regulatory purpose
to protect the public. Regional accreditation provides a higher standard
of institutional education whereas national accreditation does not. This
will cause the educational requirements for licensure as a licensed
professional counselor to be lowered in this state. While national
accreditation may sound like a higher standard, it actually is not.
Regional accreditation is higher than national accreditation. Every
single mental health licensure board in this state, psychology, social
work, licensed clinical addiction specialists, marriage and family
therapists, pastoral counselors, all require regional accreditation as
opposed to national for this very reason. Further, every single licensed
professional counselor law across the country requires regional
accreditation, not national accreditation. Regulations require that all
licensed mental health professions working in the VA, as well as working
with military families and service members, have the regional
accreditation at the standard for licensure. This could cause a
disruption in services to our military families, our military service
members, as well as to folks in the VA. That&#39;s a very serious
concern for us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you could finish up as quickly as
possible. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We seek to work together with the
Legislature to protect the public in North Carolina and to provide
qualified mental health services to citizens in this state. We welcome
the opportunity to answer any questions you may have today and to
provide any further information you may need to make an informed
decision. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I appreciate you being
here and sharing that point of view. I see a question from Senator
Rabon. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick question. Are the criteria listed here
for accreditation the same as they are now? To be licensed, these are
the same things, right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. The only thing this bill
does, and I do take issue with some of the comments made by the
gentlelady from the Board. And I think that there are some other

  This does not take away regional accreditation. It just adds people that
have been in nationally accredited schools. So what&#39;s a nationally
accredited school? It&#39;s one that&#39;s recognized by both the
Department of Education and the Council, it&#39;s called--the acronym is
CHEA, and I&#39;ve lost the name of that, on the top of my head. But to
answer your specific question, Senator Rabon, it does not change any of
the requirements for the profession. All this bill does is say that if
you have received your master&#39;s degree from a nationally accredited
institution, then you can apply to become a licensed professional
counselor in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Given the situation we have right now and the increased need for
counselors, in understanding that the resources available regionally,
not to mention folks getting out of the military who are accredited with
the same quality, as long as the standards aren&#39;t diminished,
aren&#39;t lowered, I can see no reason and I, motion for a favorable on
the bil.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I make a comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could make a comment to the military point, the military may have
requirements for their counselors. This bill will not change that at
all, and it would mean that if they require regional accreditation, then
if you&#39;re someone who&#39;s got a, from a nationally accredited
school, that you would not be able to do that. That&#39;s all that would
mean. But the situation that you have is there are a lot of faith-based
institutions of higher education that are not regionally accredited.
They&#39;re nationally accredited. And the differences betwen national
and regional accreditation have nothing to do with the actual standards
of the degree program they&#39;re producing. They have to do with the
types of courses they offer, whether a sound institution, and all of
that is determined by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and
the Department of Education. They are the ones that recognize nationally
accredited bodies. They also recognize the regional institutions. The
purpose of regional institutions are to serve schools in a specific
region. And so this bars people that have attended schools outside of
the region that we operate in, which is called SACS, from being able to
apply for this. And if I could read one thing to the committee that
refutes a few things in the letter you have before you. This is from the
website, from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools,
Commission on Colleges, this is the actual regional institution that
gives out--they say what is the difference between regional, national,
and specialized accreditation? And what they say here for national is
national accrediting bodies conduct comprehensive reviews of
institutions and operate primarily throughout the United States. The
accreditation granted encompasses the entire institution, which is
something that this letter says that it does not, the regional
institution says that it does. And most of the accredited institutions
are private and have admissions focused on either career education or
religious education. So basically what North Carolina&#39;s current law
does, is it excludes people that have gone to get a master&#39;s in
counseling from either a faith-based organization or from a
career-focused organization, from being able to become a licensed
professional counselor in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, thank you. I saw some questions. Senator Robinson, if you
would begin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. A couple of questions here. First is we received a
report from Program Evaluation Oversight some time ago that looked at
all of the licensing for different professions, et cetera, and I need to
ask staff, was this one of those that was recommended for review? Was
this one of the positions recommended by them? I don&#39;t remember this
being one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, I have--we have no idea. None of us staff Program
Evaluation and don&#39;t really work in the area of Licensing Board, so
it&#39;s something we can try to find out for you, but we have no idea
right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the bill causes some questions. I have a master&#39;s in counseling.
A lot of us have different kinds of backgrounds, et cetera, but the
standards for regional accreditation are different for a national

  <p id="35:00">
  And I think if you look at the similarity in terms of additional
requirements, when you get a Masters, and I’m making a comment, Mr.
Chair, and then I’ll ask a question. You get a Masters in any area, even
if you got a Masters in Political Science, you still have to go to law
school. So the regional accreditation has different and additional
stands, which prepares you for counseling in specific kinds of areas. We
dealing now in North Carolina with behavioral health problems. We know
we have a huge mental health issue going on across. We have to have
people with additional expertise, and I think these two accreditation
bodies, are the ones that we need to be responsive to. We might want to
ask staff to pull up, or let me ask someone to tell me what is the
difference in the regional accreditation staff? Can you do that? The
regional accreditation standards as opposed to national?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Typically, when you’re looking at regional
accreditation, you‘re looking at the accreditation of the whole
institute, and many times when you’re looking at national, they actually
look at the program within the institution, and as far as the standards
within the institution, whether it be regional or it be national, it’s a
matter of judgement as to whether those standards are better or worse or
whatever, because they’re actually developed by the organization that is
actually doing the accrediting.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; So Sen. Robinson does that help?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; That helps to some degree, Mr. Chair. The other
thing, too, is that would you tell me the two regional accrediting by
the institution in terms of their expertise around this political area?
Do you—can you answer that? The two regional accrediting bodies, is that
elicited in the letter by Dr. Glenn. The Core and Cacrep?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Yes, the Cacrep is an organization that
accredits, that looks at the program, not the institution, which would
be regional, and Core deals with rehabilative counseling. So those are
kind of the expertise of both of those accrediting bodies. Cacrep deals
with counseling in general, and Core deals with rehabilative.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Just one final follow-up, Mr. Speaker. I
appreciate us trying to make things easier and more inclusive, if that’s
what it’s about, and we recognize, but we do not—I have some concerns
about lowering standards when we have to have expertise in terms of
addressing so many issues that are out there, and I’ve heard from some
of the folk here, but I’ve heard from other licensed counselors across,
and we know we are looking at our systems here, we need to maintain in
North Carolina, because that’s what we’re known for. We’re know for
great standards here, for high quality standards, so I have some issues,
Sen. Barefoot, with this bill.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Sen. Barefoot?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; This bill doesn’t change the standards, it just
tells the licensing body what degree programs from the schools that they
can recognize for licensure. And you’ve got the U.S. Department of
Education, and the Council for Higher Education on Accreditation
recognize national programs that we don’t in North Carolina, and this
bill will allow those professionals to become licensed in the state, it
does not change standards, it just allows the licensing board to
recognize people that have attended national programs, not regional
programs. Our region only encompasses a few states. If you go to a
Master’s degree program that is outside of this region, then if may not
be recognized, and a lot of these programs are in the faith-based
community.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Sen. Bryant, I saw that you had your hand up. Do
you have a question?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chair, I wanted ask staff, and
the bill’s sponsor, what are the regional criteria that would exclude
the career programs and our faith-based programs, that Sen. Barefoot is
discussing, I’m getting the sense that there are career and faith-based
degrees, that are--

And its goals that for some reason would not need of regional
accreditation standards but somehow the degree programs in all schools
will meet said national criterium

about bills , and they think only of programs that would preclude them

anything else stepped in to become a cement at that , one of the things
I know that&#39;s a good preclude one is the actual cost of the been

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Limit it in any way and I thank you for your point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Krawiec I saw your hand up earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This may be a question for
staff. I met recently with some counselors, and we know the 7000
counselors around the state provide tremendous, they&#39;re a tremendous
resource in the rural communities providing mental health. But
they&#39;re not allowed to do first evaluations from what I understand
and a lot of time is wasted while they wait for a doctor or a social
worker to make that first evaluation when someone&#39;s a danger to
themselves or others. Can anyone answer that question for me. Does it
take additional training to be able to offer that evaluation or, does
anybody know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No that would be really getting into the healthcare
issues that we just don&#39;t have the expertise here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is a, that&#39;s a separate-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein I did see your hand up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. I-what is the list of
programs in North Carolina that meets the current standard which
requires both a regional and national accreditation? And what is the
list of programs that meet only national, but not national and regional,
so we can kind of get a sense of what the practical implication of this
bill would be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff do we have a broke down list, or is that
something we could come up with?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We don&#39;t have a broken down list at this time, but
in speaking with the DPI and some other agencies, in many cases they
look to the actual programs that are licensed-that are licensed through
them to meet the standards regionally.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s something we might be able to get to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It would be great if y&#39;all could get us that.
Staff, if you can work on compiling a list. I don&#39;t know if
we&#39;re talking about ten existing programs and three new programs, or
are we talking about 40 existing programs and 300 new programs. I just
have no idea what the practical ramifications of the bill will be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ll have staff come together what they can. All
right, we are bumping up against a meeting. I see no other hands that we
have a motion from Senator Rabin, and this is going to be a motion for a
favorable report. All in favor s-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I make one last mention? The, the Licensed
Professional Counseling Association of North Carolina is neutral on
this. They are not opposed to this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, thank you. For the motion, all in favor say
aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it, and the motion passes. Thank you
for-we do-before we conclude, all right I&#39;ll talk to Senator Davis.
I appreciate your time today and the meeting is adjourned.
