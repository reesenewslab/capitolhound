Senate will come to order.  Sergeant at Arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats.  Members and guests of the gallery will
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayers are
Reverend Peter Miller, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's pray together.  Heavenly Father as we stand
before you we need a reminder of your grace, your mercy, and sometimes
just pausing to pray can be remindful of that and sometimes it doesn't
do anything. So when we come to Scripture we ask you to teach us what
Psalm 94 says, when the cares of our heart are many your consolations
cheer my soul. So as we pass laws and in this amazing intersection of
hope and fear, as we exchange remarks and claims, may the cares of our
heart not crowd out the consolations from you, Lord.  You're a God that
loves to console us and Lord you are in fact consoling us right now.
For your glory's sake.  Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger is recognized for a motion.
