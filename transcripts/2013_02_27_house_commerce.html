between house version and senate version
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr chairman members of the committee the
senate version of the bill is passed out to the senate and sent to the
house is the third addition of the bill this bill is structured in three
parts part one of the bill consists of title basically ?? not met
recently or duplicate's or been not critical to government operations it
contains a number of boards and commissions  that are accentual repelled
in the statue part 1 of the senate bill also includes a modification ??
of the board of dietetics and nutrition in the first addition of the
senate bill that board was eliminated in later amendment of the senate
that board was modified so no longer fixes the destination of part 1
that the house committee members moves the changes to the dietetics
board into part two of the bill part 2 of the bill deals with
reorganization modification ?? number of the states some of which are
eliminated the boards are the terms of the current boards are terminated
and other change made to them those boards include resources commission

the modification ?? to part 2 of the bill is now contained in section
2.15 i believe if the part one continues to eliminate all of the other
boards that were eliminated in the senate bill and adds addition that
and the elimination of north Carolina sustainable local foods,</p>

In 2012 there was a provision that would have terminated or expired that
that council effective 2015 this provision accelerates that expiration
to July 1st 2013 and authorizez secretary of agraculture to or the
comissioner of agraculture to sustain the idea of local sustainable
foods. Part two of the bill which is sort of the heart of that fact
makes changes to many of the boards and comissions. I should say the
first thing that the house comitte substitute does is to delete the
provision supporting the twelve superior court judges, tha's no longer
in the bill. A second change that is in the house committe substitute is
the elimination of the provision relating to the utilities commision
that would stay the same. The house commitee sustitue make different and
additional modifications to the provision relating to the coastal
resources comission and the environmental management comission. It also
continues many of the to many of the other comitties. It reorganizes it
adds some new ones modifies the supervision and post realese suprvision
comission the state personel comission, The North Carolina justice and
education standards comission. It authorizes the mining and energy
comission which hold members concurently they can be on that comission
as well as hold anothr office um simultaniously uh it changes the
apointment authority for the um cheif administrative law judge for the
office of the hearings um that position is currently adminstedrd by the
supreme justice of the supreme court ths the house comittee substitute
would make that apointment by the governer and subject to conversation
by the general ssembly and would also make the apoint ment of additional
administrative law the hosue comittee poart three adds a new part to
liscencing boards it adds a provision requiring liscencing boards to
consider factors before denying liscences to applicants with criminal
records um and it also authroizez the program evaluation divison to
study the autherization of the various indepentdent liscencing and
consider the feasibility of creating a siongle state agency to oversee
the administration of the boards these last two provisions were
contained by the joint legislative procedure oversight comittee part
four of the house comitte substitute um includes the severability clause
and the effective date clause unless it is other wise provided in the
bill the eniter bill is made effective when it becomes law um Mr Shrerif
if you would like I could go section by section through this. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Based on that speach there will be summery review of the
proposed comittee sustitute I wanted to see if senator Apodaca might
want to make any comments [SPEAKER CHANEGS] Mr. Chairman I appreciate
you letting me come over I feel like the parent that sent their kid to
college and they come home at Thanksgiving and you don't recognize em so
um my goodness what have you done to my child This is not a good way to
start the session we sent a good piece of legislation over that we
worked hard on and we put a lot of effort into and thought it was mutual
but if this is what's gonna happen I'm particularly disturbed by the
judges taken out I feel like been a move by some attorneys and I do
question the ethics involved with that I just want you to know that up
front WE'll take a harder look at that but Mr. Chairman I don't know
what to say this is nothing like what we sent over so I would be wasting
the house time if I spoke about it I just look forward to seeing the
conference good bye and amen Thank You [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you
senator apodaca (Apodaca?) Uh questions or comments for members of the
committee about the proposed committee substitute Representative
Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman will I appreciate
the senators effort on this bill that I really appreciate Is the house's
effort to make this a real responsible way to reform some important
boards and commissions to reflect the values</p>

urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[00:12]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question on this, why are the, [Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The members will be appoint has been changed to require that they all be
lawyers, can I ask what the reasoning is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The industrial commission and those workers compensation cases they
awards that are awarded by the Industrial Commission are comparable to
superior court awards. In order to be a superior court judge you have to
be an attorney. So, based on the level of expertise required at the
worker, at the Industrial Commission that was a change that was
suggested by several members of the house to add an attorney requirement
in addition two of the six members have to be board certified and
workers compensation, I think there is a broad thought that this will
help the industrial commission carry out their work better in a more
knowledgeable fashion, Representative ___[01:30]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman while the Senators having a hard time seeing this
bill as it’s own and I’m having a difficult time figuring out this bill
and what I would like to ask is that the committee spend some more time
on it, I have many questions from the small like why eliminate forestry
which is one of our major industries on the coast, from the Costal
Resource Commission to the big like why are we supping the power of our
municipalities and our counties to forward names to the Governor went
from they may send them to or it ended up they may send them, it was,
they will forward nominees for the appointment. So, I’m concerned about
we are taking hands of a local and putting it back at the state. Two
another big questions, why we find the utilities commission when they
are in the middle of some right hearing some to do with my area in
particular. Finally on process, we represent the people of our district
as we all know and several of these changes are very severe and change a
lot of how we do business and how we operate, I like the opportunity to
be able to call the folks in my area to see both business and local
government to see how these changes would affect them and receive their
input.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I mean I have known this bill is coming but I
guess I still feel like I’m in shock. I’m serving now in the beginning
of a 5th term here and from the very beginning of the time I was sent
down here by the people who elected me I was asked to work in a
collegial bipartisan to the extent possible way with the folks here that
I was sent to work with and this to me just smacks of partisan sort of
opportunism, I think that it seems fairly clear that the reason that
some of these boards are being eliminated or wiped out and starting from
scratch is so that and requirements made that only certain people can
pick members of certain board is just a way to eliminate one side of
the…Sort of chance at making some sort of fair play happen. This is I
mean I can go through the whole bill and take examples but I will just
take one in particular and that is the doing away of the committee on
the first page of the dropout Prevention Committee. In a year, where we
have seen the highest rate of graduation in North Carolina in many years
and the title or the part one of the bill says, to eliminate boards and
commissions that are duplicative or are not deemed critical…

<p id="15:00">
This is a committee that I see…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, if I could ask you a question. Are you aware the
last time the dropout prevention council has met?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I am. And I know that part of the meeting had to do with the great
success that they had had over time in making sure that our high school
graduates...our high school students did graduate. I just, I think that
like my colleague, Representative Tines stated, this is something that
needs to have a little more work and a little more thought given to it.
It doesn’t look like to me anything more than, we’re going to wipe out
everything that was before and start over again and make sure that
things are not happening in a bipartisan way. It just seems fairly
obvious to me that that’s what’s at work here and I certainly cannot
support it in this form.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to send forward an amendment please. I
think the copies, I don’t know whether they’ve been passed out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They have not been passed out yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let them be passed out and then come back to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, that’s exactly what we’ll do. Representative Blackwell has an
amendment and it will be passed out and when it’s sufficiently been
passed out I will recognize you to explain your amendment.
Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, I’d like to say, partisanship and
motives put aside, and accusations put aside, I applaud the effort to
reduce the size of government through the reduction of committees and
their size and their lack of functionality. I was wondering, though, in
part one, would the bill’s sponsor be able to provide some type of
support documentation to show, perhaps, where there is duplication of
the functionality of the boards that are being limited through other
departments, agencies, or programs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren, most of the eliminations of certain state boards
and commissions in section one were discussed in the administrative
procedures oversight and for the two following reasons, either they were
no longer funded or they have not been populated or met in a significant
amount of time. I’m not sure duplication is really the issue on the
elimination of the boars in section one. There’s likely some
duplication, but mainly it was because we couldn’t find anybody to
respond to these boards and commissions because they haven’t met in so
long. That’s why they’re being eliminated in section one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand there some more amendment coming, but at the appropriate
time I’m prepared to send forward a motion on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will hold that motion until discussion has been completed.
Representative Lambeth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 19, I had just a couple questions or
observations. This relates to the dietetics nutrition board. The term,
this is line 27 on page 19, the terms of the members shall expire March
31, and the members of the board shall take office on the first day of
July. I wondered what happens during that period of time if the boards
terminated and then the new board takes its role July. There’s a period
in there where there’s no boad oversight. That’s the question. The
second question relates to staggered terms. Generally, I like staggered
terms. This has all of them coming on or off at the same time, and I
wondered about the staggered terms issue as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re talking about the staggered specific to the dietetics board?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For that board only.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll recognize Karen Cocher-Brown to address the issues with the
dietetics board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The article six, section ten of the constitution
and GS128-7 provide basically for a holdover of members when their terms
expires and a new appointments have not been made. Under the
constitution and under statute, the current members would hold over
until new members are appointed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that explanation. That sufficient?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. That’s good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair. Mr. Chairman, what fault was given in this process when you
have those people on the board who had the expertise and you’re
preparing to transition it to folks who you just might...like I said,
some of them</p>

<p id="20:00">
Political appointments no doubt, but what thought was given that for our
citizens back home who rely on some of these agencies with people of
expertise. What thought was given to that, if you don't mind me asking
Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. As specifically to the Coastal Resources
Commission and the EMC, and environmental management commission - while
the Senate version had a clean sweep in both of those, the House version
is not a clean sweep. So we retain roughly 50% of the existing members
on those two boards specifically to allow for that continuity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know that this is the environment that we operate
in, but what assurances that this comes to pay that both parts of the
House will have equal opportunity to make sure that we have members. I
mean, can we have that assurance? I know you just can't tell what the
future going to hold, but I--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I expect a robust conference process on this
legislation [laughter].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was trying to make sure I
understood the appointment phase schedule for the Coastal Resource
Commission and the EMC. A new castle shall be appointed in the manner
provided by this subsection, with terms beginning on July 1st, 2013, and
expiring on 2015. Could you explain-- could someone explain this,
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. That is very confusing part of the
legislation by it. And it was to preserve that continuity issue that
many of us had talked about. So I'm going to recognize Karen Crocker
Brown to explain how we drafted that. Jeff's going to explain how we
drafted that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. The language here, there's similar language for
the environmental management commission, it's designed to keep some of
the current membership of the commission in place. Whereas if you look
at the language at the bottom of page six, it provides that the terms of
the members of the Coastal Resource Commission - in this case serving at
the beginning of the year - expire when the act becomes law. Except as
provided in the section. And if you look over on page seven there are
four subdivisions starting out lines four through 17. These describe
positions held by current members of the Coastal Resources Commission,
and provide that those members serving in those particular positions
continue to serve until June 30th, 2014. Although the other members of
the commission would be removed and would be reappointed by their
appropriate appointing authority, the four members serving in these
current positions would continue to serve until June 30th, 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] These, pretend for just a minute I don't know who
these four members are, can we describe what these categories are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I can do that. The first one, subdivision one -
that's page seven, line four - this person shall-- they're currently in
the position of representing experienced and commercial fisherman on the
existing Coastal Resources Commission. And on the revised Coastal
Resources Commission they will serve under subdivision eight, which is
also a commercial fishing position. That's also part of the idea is that
the experience of these existing members is carried over into their new
positions on the revised Coastal Resources Commission. Subdivision two,
that member currently serves in a wildlife or sports fishing position.
Under the revised Coastal Resources Commission statue, they will serve
under the sports fishing position. A third person is currently serving
which experience in local government within the coastal area. That
person will serve in a position for experiencing local government within
a coastal area on the revised CRC, and then the final member is
currently serving an at-large position, and would be carried over into
the revised Coastal Resources Commission to serve an at-large position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that help? Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Could I ask the same question on the EMC?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The transitional language.</p>

For the internal management assistance at the top of page 11 and it

has been sufficiently pastels you're recognized explain your memo by its
 (SPEAKER CHANGES)  thank you Mr. chairman on this is the right thing to
a fairly straightforward amendment one then I believe to be important
and lives as many of PCs stands on one page 12 in section 2.48 dealing
with the industrial commission would simply say the income of members of
the commission already the terms are terminated as of April 5 to eighth
and would go away all new people on my problem with that particular
piece of the bill he is that if someone alluded to earlier the decisions
of the International Commission or sensually judicial decisions of
thousands of employees and employers across the state go before the
Industrial  Commission to get their case is decided in heard I think it
sends the wrong message to suggest that we don't like a group of people
making these judicial decisions at the Industrial  Commission soldiers
from afar mall employee all new people that seems to suggest to me that
we're more interested in whether are making decisions we approve all of
them that they're following wall justice this bill is the PCs and then
amended to eliminate the firing of judges we checked and would've been a
bad idea for the reason that we should let judges serve out the terms
let them expire August they all are engaged in this behavior we're
always use of dealing with bad as there are with the Industrial
Commission on shore but given the fact that this is a judicial function
that the Industrial  Commission on cares Alt, my own argument to the
members of this committee is that we all had functional presently
serving sure about their terms Allies agree all the provisions relating
to the National Commission with regard to qualifications of members all
with regard to on diminishing away from terms of new appointees are and
are our national house to believe this amendment which essentially say
is currently serving members serve out their terms of a wise we go to
the provisions so far the PCs are (SPEAKER CHANGES) some dollar papers
(SPEAKER CHANGES) thank you Mr. chairman subcommittee in and of a
greatly respect to the wisdom of friction of the liberals however on it
to disagree with him rather strenuously on this particular amendment on
is one of the prime sponsors on, the workers' compensation reform bill
Harley parts and info? And all were mostly on the number two that a
correction Crawford with the other prime sponsor for myself and one of
the things we discussed quite a bit, was you know many of the problems
are currently on the Industrial Commission that have been documented in

<p id="30:00">
due respect to folks that are over, we've had serious problems with the
operation of that commission and there's only one part of it that is the
actual adjudication of those cases. That's one part of it. But people
forget about all of the folks over there, hundreds actually, who were
working on all kind of other aspects of processing claims and cases and
data that has been, and ensuring, for example, that employers that are
supposed to be having workers' comp have workers' comp. We've seen all
of these problems and, frankly, we need to clean house. We do need to
accelerate. Obviously we could not do that last year because, in the
legislation, because, quite frankly, the Governor at the time would not
agree to go along with that. But I think everybody that's looked at this
really, really closely understands that we've got a serious problem with
the industrial commission and we need to go ahead and get with the
qualifications that are in this legislation. We need to go ahead and get
some changes made and some new eyes and new perspective and fix this
commission. It is important to the effective implementation of the
legislation that this General Assembly has passed and it should have,
hopefully, a fix to the administrative issues that have been long and
systemic with this commission. So, with all due respect, I would request
that you vote no on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I agree with much of what Representative Dollar
said but I've actually just got a question for staff on how this would
work. When I read it it looks like this would effectively nullify the
rest of that provision. Can you, maybe I'm reading something wrong, can
you help me understand how it works?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Ms. Brown, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, the amendment provides basically not
withstanding the changes that are being enacted in 97-77A, which are the
new changes, basically changing the term to 4 years and requiring that
they be [??]. Not withstanding that the Industrial Commission members
that are serving currently would complete their terms as provided in
section 22, session log 2011-287, and in that bill, last year, you all
basically set out a staggered set of expirations for each of the members
of the Industrial Commission. So this would basically provide that when
their terms expire new appointments would be made, pursuant to the
changes in the law that will become effective when this becomes
effective.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess what's throwing me is, on the amendment where it says rewriting
the lines, it looked to me like we were deleting, in essence, those new
staggered terms.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct, Representative Samuelson. We're deleting those staggered
terms and putting back in the staggered terms that you all created last
year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, did you want to speak to the amendment? You're
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. First of all, let me ask Ms. Brown a question. We established
staggered terms for the Industrial Commission in the last session. Now,
give me an idea of the timetable, when are these terms, how many are
coming due this year or the next year? When will a majority of the
membership be rotating up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have the section in front of me and it basically provides that one
term expired April 30th, 2011, that's already happened. Two terms expire
June, 2012, that's already happened. One term expires April 30th, 2013,
one expires June 30th, 2014, one term expires April 30th, 2015, and the
last term expires June 30th, 2016.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, just a comment on the amendment. I'm going to support the amendment
from Representative Blackwell. We want to enable the General Assembly to
influence the policy of this state through the appointments but I really
think that we need to take the long view on these commissions and boards
as opposed to the short</p>

term view. Now, we went through a major re-write of the Industrial
Commission in the last session and with workers' compensation laws an we
recognized that the terms needed to be staggered and that there is a
value in having some institutional knowledge on this board. I don't have
any idea of whether their good commissioners or bad commissioners or
who's doing a good job or who's doing a bad job. But we have a process
that we've already established, that's less than two years old, where we
can make reasonable appointments. I think that it's wrong-headed for us
to do this at this time. I think it sends the wrong message to the
public. I think that it sends the wrong message to the people who sent
us here. Yes, we want to be able to influence these boards but we've
already set up a process by which we do that. I think the systematic
process that we set up last session is good and I support the amendment
to stay with the staggered terms.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment. I'd like to speak the amendment in favor of
it. With respect to Nelson Dollar, I know he knows a great deal about
the Industrial Commission, and most of the decisions are administrative,
a great deal of them are. But as I read the resolution from
Representative Blackwell, it's about full commissioners and most of the
decisions of the full commission are on rules of law. So I hope you will
consider supporting this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I actually speak on the amendment, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd actually like to speak against the amendment. Someone has sent me a
report that shows that there was a recent performance audit report that
shows the North Carolina Industrial Commission has been lax in
monitoring data  to make sure that North Carolina businesses are keeping
up with their duty. Even our bipartisan auditor, Beth Wood, had comments
in there that they aren't doing what they need to be doing and so,
therefore, I think, even though we put in the new system, apparently the
people who are there are not doing the job, according the performance
report or according to our auditor that they were supposed to be doing
and this may be a way to restructure it so that we can get the people
who are doing the work that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll also add, not withstanding the amendment, the section in the
proposed committee substitute does not alter the staggering term. The
terms are still staggered. Representative Dollar, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just, thank you, Mr. Chairman, I would just point out that had
we been able to do something a little different in section 22 last time,
we would have. The provision in the bill before you, having two, two,
and two on the staggered basis, two for up to 2015, two up to 2016, and
two up to 2017 is a much better way to do this and we do need to get
change on the commission. The reality is you're not going to fix the
problems, many of the problems, that we have in the Industrial
Commission until you get the leadership changes that we need on that
commission. That's just the honest reality of it. So I think that we
need to vote against the amendment and we need to have the provisions
that we got in this proposed bill. And again I would say, as one of the
sponsors of the reform bill, I do not have confidence that we're going
to get the true, full value, I would say put it that way, of that
legislation until we affect the leadership changes that need to be
affected. So again, I would just respectfully ask you to vote against
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm speaking against the amendment simply
because, having gained a significant amount of knowledge over the last
few weeks in other areas, what we're facing, to a great extent, isn't
the fact that people know what they're supposed to be doing. The fact is
simply they're doing it. There have been instances of flagrant disregard
for legal statutes that were put in to place. There have been prejudices
that have been instituted into the performance of duties and I feel like
we are fully within the rights, as elected officials looking out for
what's in the best interest of the state of North Carolina, to examine
how people are doing their jobs and if they are not doing it in the
manner to which it should be done we take action. Thank you.</p>

further discussion on the amendment. Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I just want to point out that I've researched a couple of
these committees and 60% of the EMC and 60% of the CRC appointments
would be up for reappointment within, by summer of next year. So that's
the majority in a fairly short period of time, so I just mention that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion on the amendment. Hearing none, all those in favor
will say aye. All those opposed say no. In the opinion of the Chair the
no's have it. The no's do have it. Representative Hager, you are
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an amendment, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
While Representative Hager's amendment is being passed out I will
continue. Representative Shepard, did you have a comment that you would
like to make on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I have questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, did you have a comment that you would like to
make on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just had a question about the staggering on page 7, where you were
ending them all on the 14th, and I was wondering what the original
ending date for those people, for those four, would have been?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So on page 7, I have that you're discussing the, are you asking about
the CRC or on the previous page, continuing from the, that's correct,
CRC.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The CRC.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jeff, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is true for both the staggering here and the
staggering for the EMC. What we did was we looked for members who
actually, their current terms end on, in this case, June 30th, 2014. So
these four members will get to serve out their current full term so,
under current law, they serve through June 30th, 2014. Under the
proposed committee substitute they serve through June 30th, 2014. For
the EMC, those four members currently serve until June 30th, 2015. Under
the PCS they serve their full term through June 30th, 2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're welcome. Does everybody have a copy of the amendment offered by
Representative Hager? Representative Hager, you are recognized to
explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment actually puts the Utility
Commission back into the bill and let me explain why. Several of us met
with Chairman Finley last week and asked him some fairly pertinent
questions. Let me give you guys some data on the seven members on the
Utility Commission. Six out of seven, and I'm not making any disparaging
remarks here, the six out of seven are attorneys on that board right
now. Only one member of that board has any industry experience on
working in utilities, that's Chairman Finley. And in the conversations
we had with Chairman Finley he did agree that it would be good to take
the board from the commission and from five to seven and to put some
unique experiences on that board that had actually had some experiences
within the industry of which their making decisions on. So if you take a
look at the bill, it basically does that. It reduces the membership
commission, or the amendment I should say, reduces the membership
commission to five members. It reduces the current members' terms, the
current members other than the chair and that's important because we
need some continuity on there, other than the chair to June 30th, and it
provides that future appointees must have five years of what we call
progressively experienced. That means that as they started in the
industry it progressively got more into the industry and to the sector
of business. And it provides that they may not be an office holder of
any key party or service delegate of any party. That's basically, in a
nutshell, what this long amendment does. There was a question earlier, I
think by Representative Tine, or a discussion earlier about rate cases
moving forward. This date has set. The rule is, right now, they actually
can make a rate case decision with three members of the board and the
rules are you have to start the rate case to be able to decide on the
rate case. This date, on the June 30th, is set up so the rate case, I
think the current rate case is</p>

progress, if I'm not mistaken, will get completed before they start  the
Duke rate case after that, so these are set up so the rate cases are

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion on the amendment offered by Representative Hager.
Representative Starnes, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well, obviously I don't like this amendment either. You know,
if there's anything that's not broken in North Carolina, it's our
utilities commission, and I just disagree that you have to have
industry-related experience to be a member of the commission. You don't
have to have any type of requirement or experience to be a member of the
general assembly, or a county commission, or a school board, and yet,
what I think is that we have to trust the people who are making
appointments to this Board, and I believe that if you nominate and
appoint people of reasonable intelligence, they have the ability to
learn the issue of front of them, and I want to give them more credit
than some of my other colleagues will. You know, I just really think
that the utilities commission, and the way we've got it structured now,
it works, primarily for the benefit of the consumer in North Carolina,
who's dependent on affordable electricity, but they're meeting the needs
of the utility industry as well. They're able to operate, operate it at
a profit, and build the facilities that they need to make sure that we
have the infrastructure in place to provide a stable and reliable source
of electricity. And of course, the utilities commission does more than
just electricity, they have a number of issues that they deal with. But
I just oppose this amendment just because I think you're trying to fix
something that's not broken.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, you're recognized to discuss the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, this amendment, I feel kind of like, with Representative Hagens on
one side and Representative Starnes on the other, kind of like, some of
my friends like this, and some of them don't, and I'm voting with my
friends on this one. That's kinda the position I'm in. But I actually
like this amendment, and the reason I like this amendment is for three
things that I see right behind the other. I think it is important that
for something as significant as rate-setting ability that we do have
some knowledge of what's going on. I might like to be a member of the
utilities commission rather than being in the legislature so I can make
125 grand for attending however many meetings it is they have a year,
but I don't know anything about setting rates. I really don't, and I
don't think I'd be a very good member of that committee. So I think it
is good that people have some background in finance or rate-setting or
something related to what they're doing. Second thing, I like the fact
that they're now gonna be under the State Government Ethics Act, just
like you and I are. And third thing I like is that apparently there's a
move to depoliticize this thing. The last two lines on the first page
there. So for all those reasons, I'm gonna support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, you're recognized to debate this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins did a good job of describing being stuck between
a rock and a hard place. The two things I have disliked about the Senate
version of this bill were the inclusion, originally, of the judges, and
the inclusion of the utilities commission. And so, I was pretty
delighted when I saw this morning that the utilities commission was out.
However, I also recognized that when it gets to the Senate during our
conference committee, the Senate is likely to want to put it back in,
and I don't want to send it over there and have the Senate put in what
they had, but on the other hand, I'd really rather not have it in at
all, and so, I'm gonna vote my conscience and vote against the
amendment, but I'm going to encourage the Senate to recognize that if
you're going to put the utilities commission back in, the only halfway
reasonable way to put it back in is the way we've got it described here
in this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Earle, you're recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was wondering if it would be possible for
me to introduce an amendment based on the issue that Representative
Starnes raised.  Could we name a representative from Cherokee County to
the coastal resources commission?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any member is able to introduce any amendment that they wish.
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, and in all due respect to my majority
leader, the commission does handle things like the fuel clause, for
instance. And I doubt a handful of folks in here could tell me what the
fuel clause does, and how it is involved</p>

<p id="50:00">
With online efficiency factors and how much fuel you burn as a coal unit
or as a nuclear unit. So if you're making decisions on the fuel clause
and you don't understand online efficiency factor or at least have one
person that does, then I think you're making the decision on things you
don't know, you know nothing about. So I think there are certain
technical issues that you have to address. There are some technical
expertise we need on that panel to be able to make good decision on rate
cases, on fuel costs cases, on these other cases that will come up. So I
would ask you to vote for the amendment because I think it puts the
right expertise on there and for some of the reasons that Rep. Samuelson
said. If you go ahead and get this in our bill, it'll actually probably
help the Senate decide where this, where this part needs to be instead
of going back to their original version.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Vice Chair Brawley is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, you know, an interesting
point was made about that there aren't really qualifications to serve in
the General Assembly, and I have to admit some days that shows. Um,
also, of course, the voters get the opportunity to correct that more
easily than we do, members of the Utilities Commission. Having spent
some time in the utility industry making rates. One of the point of the
Utilities Commission is to allow utilities to operate efficiently and
make a profit while still providing service to the people of North
Carolina at minimum cost. During the discussion of the merger between
Duke Energy and Progress Energy, there was a considerable discussion
about the number of jobs that would remain in Raleigh, and with all due
respect to the city that hosts this esteemed body, as a rate payer in
Mecklenburg, I don't wanna pay higher electric rates because the job's
in Raleigh that should have been in Charlotte or eliminated completely.
Someone that really understands the theory of rate-making would
understand create jobs and higher rates. You allow the utilities, in
fact you push the utilities, to eliminate jobs they don't really need
and reduce rates and thereby protecting the using and consuming public
who is supposed to be the benefit of this commission. So I would say the
recent record has shown that there probably is a need for adjustment
here, and I'm supporting the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion on the amendment? Hearing none --
I'm sorry. Rep. Catlin?? --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized. I'd like to speak in support of
the amendment also. Uh, the one thing I don't support is paying that
much money to the Utilities Commission, but if we're going to, we need
to have people that have qualifications, that can understand what we're
trying to do and can understand the importance of what we're trying to,
and so I support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Blackwell, you are recognized for, to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, uh, reluctantly oppose the amendment. I just make
two observations. The commission has a technical staff for the purpose
of  advising the commissioners and helping the commissioners, just as we
have research and bill drafting and all the other staff that support us,
so you're not called upon to come to the Utilities Commission already
knowing everything so that you have nothing to learn, but just to go
ahead and take advantage of your own knowledge and experience that you
bring. The second thing I would like observe is that, uh, these members
appointed by the governor have to be confirmed by the General Assembly.
Now if we have  concern that somebody is not qualified to bring the
skills and the judgment to take advantage of the staff and the arguments
before the commission and the other resources are available, we ought
not to approve them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion on the amendment offered by Rep.
Hager. Rep. Hager, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Real quick, Mr. Chairman. Uh, no we've looked at that
confirmation process in the past, and you look at what we've got on the
Utilities Commission, I'm sure they're all good folks,  but we've had
through the confirmation, through the same confirmation process Rep.
Blackwell spoke of, we've got seven, six, uh, seven attorneys that have,
all but one, have zero experience in the industry. We're dealing with
very complicated issues, and if you are relating, and we have a great
staff here, but if you are requiring all your knowledge to come from the
staff, then there's some issue there when they're actually making your
mind up for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion on the amendment offered by Rep.
Hager? Hearing none, all those in favor will say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All those in favor say No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??? of the Chair, the ayes have it. The ayes do have
it. We have one more amendment offered by Rep. Robert Brawley.

well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does everybody have a copy of the amendment offered by
Representative Robert Brawley?  Representative Robert Brawley, you are
recognized to explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ladies and gentlemen, all
this simple little amendment does is say you don't have to get an
attorney to serve on the Industrial Commision.  We've heard that the
majority of the decisions are administrative, and I don't see any reason
why there'll have to be an attorney make that kind of decision.  I think
it would be better off if they had some practical experience in
business.  I move the adoption of the amendment and be glad to answer
any question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion and debate on the amendment of
Representative Brawley?  Representative Dollar, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, I would concede to my friend from Iredell County
that you certainly make the case, but one thing I would bring back to
the attention on this is that these cases, once they are heard by a
deputy commissioner, the deputy commissioner hears the case and then the
full commissioners sitting in panels of 3, which is the way they do
these cases, they review those appeals.  Any appeals coming from the
Industrial Commission goes directly to the North Carolina Court of
Appeals.  In other words, there's no trial de novo in Superior Court for
Industrial Commission cases.  These cases go directly to the North
Carolin Court of Appeals.  And so I understand the intent of the
legislation, I mean the amendment, and I suppose it doesn't prevent the
Governor from recommending attorneys for all of the positions, I would
still hope we realize these folks are serving, and do have the powers of
basically a Superior Court judge for the purposes of adjudicating these
claims.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion on the amendment?  Representative
Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The commission is the
Industrial Commission, it's not the Attorney Commission?  I don't why
business people should be excluded.  They're living with the decisions
this commission makes.   This commission is one that was named
specifically by constituents of mine that they had issues with, and
these are people that are business people, that create jobs.

Representative Caitlin, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have one more question of legal staff, I
suppose. Is the conflict of interest provisions that we added to this
substitute ensure that the EMC will meet the federal conflict of
interest standards and allow us, the state authority, to regulate the
clean air act and the clean water act?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, can you answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The current conflict of interest provisions and currently law of EMC
have been restored so what they're currently operating under has been
restored in the House Proposed Committee Substitute and additional
clarifying language has been added to make it abundantly clear that the
commission is also under the state ethics act. It is, but we’ve also
stated it in the EMC statute so they have both existing law and some
extra clarification.
