[SPEAKER CHANGES].
House Bill 817, Strategic Transportation and Investments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Harrington is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. This bill is a new plan for transportation,
and we've worked hard to see all regions of the state have more
opportunity than ever to fund all modes of transportation. It has been
reviewed and vetted in the Transportation, Finance, and Appropriations
Committees in both the House and Senate. It passed the House with 102
votes in a bipartisan effort, to reform our transportation system.
I would like to thank Senators Stein, Blue, and McKissick for their
comments in the Finance Committee, which resulted in several
improvements to the bill, and I very much appreciate them working with
us to make the best bill possible. And if I may, Mr. President, I would
like to yield to my Co-Chair, Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Rabin is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. To debate the bill, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Members, for two decades we've worked with the transportation
framework that changed the face of our state. Paved thousands of miles
of road that built an interstate system that expanded commerce and
connected people and places. Changes to our state that the creation of
the Highway Trust Fund brought about then, now demands that we modernize
and prepare for the next two decades. This bill is about what is best to
do for our state as a whole. Without undue influence of politics, but it
gives a local voice more opinions and more responsibility in how we move
forward in the transportation decisions of tomorrow. The connections and
access between our rural areas and our urban areas are areas that this
bill directly applies to.
I want to say that a lot of work has gone into this. It's gone through
six committees, we've talked to everyone who has wanted to come to the
table and talk, it is totally and completely without any partisan
measures in it, a study group has worked countless hours on it, and we
have brought to the floor of the Senate a bill which has passed the
House with over 100 votes. A bill that finally will keep North Carolina
in the lead and its infrastructures will go forward.
I appreciate the work of everyone. I certainly hope that we can have the
support of everyone in the Senate. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Stein has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, I just want to thank
Senator Rabin and Senator Harrington. McKissick, Blue, and I were
concerned about the public transit piece. They didn't, maybe this will
make y'all happy, they didn't do everything we wanted, but they did do
something and we appreciate their willingness to work with us. And thank
you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say that as one of those who
participated in the creation of the Highway Trust Fund, that I thought
that it was a great creation back in 1989. It was a bipartisan effort,
Governor Martin was the Governor, and driven primarily through the House
by Speaker Mavretic. But the amazing thing is that we put together the
votes to pass that, which increased the amount of money available for
transportation in this state, transportation construction. Increased it
on the order of about 50, 60 percent immediately, and over time about
100 percent. And I think it's timely that the formula be looked at. You
have to cobble things together from a political standpoint when you're
trying to do something new, and especially something like, that
generated the kind of income that the Highway Trust Fund did.
I want you to know that I stand ready to work with Senator Harrington,
Senator Rabin, or anybody else who's working on it. And they, I think,
have done a great job, I serve on Appropriations Subcommittee with them.
But I stand ready to help them. And I think all of us</p>

…To know that not in the long run but in the short run and immediately
we are gonna have to do something drastic to put resources and to build
in the transportation infrastructure that this state needs for the 21st
Century and now that these adjustments have then made I hope all of us
are ready to put our shoulder to the wheel to do just said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt what purpose you has?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate, I would like to speak
to this bill about what the bill doesn’t do not necessarily what it does
do as Senator Bill pointed out in 88 we wanna get the trust fund bill we
substantially increase the amount of money going into transportation I
believe almost doubly because we had a situation where they are just
simply wasn’t enough, we have half of the state that did not ___[01:04]
in highway anyway near and we had to get people back in the game and
that over the years has I think tremendously enhance this state is
certainly has enhanced our transportation system and I think that’s a
very much a part of good jobs etcetera. And the big problem with this
bill is we are taking the same resources which everybody in the room
would say are not enough and now we are register it. Well, the people
that are getting and not getting enough, do you know of anybody that got
excessive highway funds or excessive maintenance allowance? I don’t, and
we are gonna take all of that and put it in department and we are gonna
registered it and by the way we will find out about all of this how we
are gonna do that, we don’t have the formula now. We are gonna be tell
later what that will be. And for those who live outside of the three
main urban areas in the state, you are giving up the only sure thing you
have got which is the equity formula that guarantees you get a little
bit of money to go into the system where we are going to let DOT
basically decide where the money goes and I wanna tell you something
they are powerful in the state, they will descend on them and we get all
the money but you don’t have to believe me go look at history that’s why
you have an equity formula. So, everybody gives a little bit or anything
left for some. And the more rural you are I think the more you are at
risk in this bill. And I cannot believe that with the history we have
the transportation programs and transportation money that we are sitting
here taking a pig in the poke and saying, “We are gonna step up we got
and then we will find that later what we are gonna have.” I know what
you are gonna have and you are fixing to find out what you are gonna
have? You are gonna have less in these areas that needed and I know of
some what happens every time you go through this people get call, “Oh,
this will help you or this will help you.” And every time we have ever
done it didn’t haven’t help you. I know the Senator Apodaca now up way
we are looking at Act 26 it needs to be widened from ___[04:06] Bill, we
have got a missing link of the interstate highway system in Asheville,
North Carolina. Act 26 starts in one line I would be willing to bet that
this thing don’t fix that when I see the mobility fund which was what I
think we are heading toward all these things still get push to the back
and just to understand that’s what you are doing and you are gonna have
to explain to your people where the money went, where it’s gone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird what purpose you ask?

[Speaker Change]
As a lifelong resident of North Carolina and transportation
professional, with thirty five years’ experience in North Carolina and
supporter of the current administration, he wants to point out there are
three areas that he feels quote devastating several programs which has
already placed North Carolina as a leader in Southeastern
transportation. And I agree with that so I want to describe to you what
he feels is very detrimental in this Bill and I agree with. The first is
a rail transit system. And of course our Governor was responsible for
one of the best systems in the State.  And then our interstate rural
passenger service which will are just embarking on will be impacted
negatively. And finally bicycle pedestrian. Well we say that’s not very
important. But as he points out and as I know from my experience
industry comes here for certain reasons. There are four leading ones
that have come up with studies. The first is good transportation system
which of course we have. The second is a good education system which we
have had. The third is a well-trained community workforce. And the
fourth, believe it or not, is amnesties. And this type of bicycle mode
of transportation, which is being diminished, will have an impact when
people are looking at the quality of life and wanting to come here. So I
think he hits it, the nail on the head, and I agree with him and for
that reason I will not vote for the Bill. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Apocada, what is the purpose you arise?
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Apocada has the floor to speak to the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
It’s always amazing to me how we can find ways to not to do things in
this chamber. You know, Senator Nesbitt and I agree on a lot of thing.
We disagree on a lot of things. And I think this is one we will have to
respectfully disagree on, because the week before last I arrived on I
twenty six at about quarter to five o’clock, and tried to get to
Hendersonville from Ashville.  I can go by the RDU airport at five
fifteen and make better time than I did going down the road down to
Hendersonville. The point of this is, we’ve had the old system, it
hasn’t helped. This system gives us a little light at the end of the
tunnel.  You know, I would love to be able to have a greenway between
Ashville and Hendersonville, ride a bicycle, take a train. But right now
I would love to drive between Ashville and Hendersonville. So it can’t
be any worse than it has been and hopefully what I see in this is, and
my compliments, this may give us a little light at the end of the
tunnel. So I fully support it.
[Speaker Change]
Further discussion, further debate. Senator McKissick, what purpose do
you arise?
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
I would like to thank Senator Rayburn, Senator Harrington for working
with us on this Bill. I think it’s better than where it originally
started. I have some concerns about provisions in here related to mass
transit and the way those funds would be competed for because I think in
those major urban areas [???] where we do have high concentrations of
population, we need to do all that we can to decrease the number of
vehicles per day on our roads and to provide alternatives. Whether they
are fixed rail systems, bus systems, or what have you. So I would like
to see greater flexibility to allow for that. But having said that, I
think that, well if you look at the ratios that will be provided for in
terms of forty percent at state level, thirty percent at regional, kind
of thirty percent local, it provides a reasonable approach that we
deserve to fully evaluate and take a look at. And to try to go down this
route, I think it’s a thoughtful route. I think if it helps us
prioritize our projects, which helps us to spend our resources more
effectively, then I believe it’s an approach we should give a try.
[Speaker Change]
Members and guest in the gallery, let me just remind you again. Please
silence all of your electronic devices at this time. Thank you. Is there
any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of the Senate Committee Substitute number three,
the House Bill eight seventeen, on its second reading. All in favor will
vote aye. Oppose the vote no.  Five seconds to be allowed for the voting
and the clerk will record the vote.  Forty two having voted in the
affirmative and five in the negative. Senate Committee substitute number
three to House Bill eight seventeen passes its second reading and it
will remain on the calendar. House Bill nine ninety eight, the clerk
will read.

Exemplification and reduction act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, members of the Senate. We have come to this
point in the discussion, the debate on the issue of tax reform. We've
talked about it for years. I've been in the General Assembly since
Janunary of 2001 and I think it's a subject that has been discussed
literally every session since then. We have not, up until now, been able
to move anything that could be described as comprehensive tax reform. We
have, and you've all heard all of these things, and on much of these
things there's much agreement. We have a great need for comprehensive
tax reform. We have, at the present time, tax rates that are among the
highest in the country and clearly the highest in the Southeast. We have
a tax system, a tax code, that is overly complicated. It is a tax code
that, if you get the book, is about that thick that we ask our citizens
and our businesses to comply with, and it is a tax code that is sorely
in need of updating and reform because you see it's based on a model
that dates back to the 1930's for an economy that really doesn't exist
anymore. And it's a tax code that many of us believe make it more
difficult for North Carolina to shake off the after-effects of what some
are beginning to call the Great Recession. Unemployment rates remain one
of the highest in the Nation and many people point to the fact that
we're just not competitive in connection with our taxing system; and so
what we have in front of us is what in many respects is a compromised
bill. Many of you who are on the finance committee have heard a lot of
this and you've seen a number of bills that have been introduced this
year to address the subject of tax reform. You've also received, I am
certain, as I have received, numerous hundreds probably thousands of
emails on various aspects of tax reform. And so what we have is a bill
that I believe represents a significant effort towards comprehensive tax
reform and represents a real compromise in terms of some of the issues
that were out there. So let me tell you what the bill does - and I'm
just going to read this summary from our nonpartisan staff. The Senate
Committee substitute for House bill 998 reduces individual and business
tax rates, it helps offset revenue loss from the wait reductions
applicable to all taxpayers by eliminating tax expenditures and
referential rates and referential refunds in the sales tax. The bill
makes the following specific changes to the state's tax structure. One:
It replaces the individual income tax structure with a simple flat rate
structure. It eliminates all exemptions, deductions, and credits except
for the child credit, provides a zero tax rate for the first fifteen
thousand dollars of income for married filing jointly, and sets a flat
rate of 5.4% for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and
reduces the rate again for 5.25% for taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2015. Our current individual income tax rate has a high
marginal rate of seven and three quarters percent so it represents a
substantial reduction from the current rate. Second thing: It replaces
the current tax structure on business entities with a new flat rate per
business entity. Current business tax structure consists of a corporate
income tax, franchise tax, state and local privilege taxes, and annual
reporting fees payable to the secretary of state. The bill phases out
the corporate income and franchise tax, eliminates the state and local
privilege taxes, and eliminates the annual report filing fees. When
fully implemented the flat tax amount for ?? corporations will be five
thousand dollars and the flat tax amount for all other limited liability
business entities is seven hundred and fifty dollars. Significant thing
about that is, not only does it reduce the rates, it simplifies the</p>

<p id="030:00">
[Speaker Change]
The calculation of tax for businesses across the State. Third thing, the
Bill eliminates overtime, several sales tax exemptions, and preferential
tax rates. It eliminates the franchise tax on electricity and the excise
tax on pipe natural gas and taxes the two with the State combined
general rate. And it eliminates the gross receipts privilege tax on
amusements and taxes amusements at the State and local sales rate. The
Bill continues a distribution to cities of a proportion of the generated
from electricity, pipe, and natural gas. The next Bill that the Bill
does say. It eliminates food from the local tax base effective November
One, Two Thousand Fourteen. Food is currently subject to a two percent
local sales tax. The Bill does give counties the authority to levy a
sales tax on food at the county’s local sales tax rate. Local sales tax
rates for counties vary from two percent to two and three quarters
percent, county to county. The next thing, the Bill begins to require
for farmers to meet the annual gross income tax require, gross income
tax requirement of ten thousand dollars from farming operations to
qualify for sales tax exemptions for farmers. The next, the Bill
eliminates the estate tax. Some have referred to that as the death tax.
Next, the Bill eliminates the ear marking of State revenues derived from
the deed stamped tax and the scrap tire disposal tax by directing the
proceeds from those taxes to the general fund. And then the Bill
eliminates the two percent to wholesalers for remitting excise tax on
cigarettes and other tobacco products. Passing this Bill will help
create jobs. Reason I say that is the economist that we’ve talked with
will tell you that reducing taxes, reducing obligations in compliance
with taxes on corporations makes those corporations more competitive and
makes it possible for them to create jobs. You have to look really no
further than the rating structure from the tax foundation which rates
every State in the nation, in terms of business climate. Presently North
Carolina is ranked forty fourth in business tax climate. We have one of
the worst business tax climates in the nation. If this Bills past as
drafted North Carolina’s business tax climate will move up to number
six. We will leap frog all of the States that are ahead of us in our
region. A lot of folks talk about Texas and how great Texas is in terms
of creating jobs and how their tax climate is as good as it is. If you
look at the business tax ratings from the tax foundation, Texas
currently ranks ninth. We will end up ahead of Texas in terms of
business tax climate. That will translate into jobs for the people of
North Carolina. That will translate into additional business activity in
North Carolina. That will translate into all sorts of good things for
people looking for jobs and are starving for jobs at the present time.
The other thing that this does is, we have heard, loud and clear from
people from across the State that its, its problematic to tax food. Well
if it’s problematic for the State to tax food, then it’s problematic for
local governments to tax food as well. And so what, what this Bill does
is says, as far as the State is concerned food is not something that
should be in the sales tax base. However it does give local governments
the ability to move, to move in that direction if they, if they see fit.
The other thing that we have heard is that there were a lot of concerns
about the possibility of taxing other things such as prescription
medicines. This Bill does not do that. There were other concerns
expressed about the impact on, on the people already on social security.
I actually met with a representative of the AARP and I asked her to
present us with some scenarios that they were concerned about in terms
of how this Bill will impact people who are receiving social security.
And in each instance that they provided to us of an example of a couple
or an individual. Their income, social security income, plus any other
income. In each instance, under this Bill, they would either pay less
State tax or their State tax would remain at zero. And so this is a Bill
that is positive.</p>

North Carolinians under those scenarios were less under this bill than
under the bill that came over from the House.
Again, this bill represents a significant compromise from the position
that has been advocated. In many corners, it represents a huge win for
the people of North Carolina, in that, if we believe that the free
enterprise system is the best system available to us, and that jobs are
created in the private sector, ultimately, not all jobs created in the
public sector, that what this bill will do will help jump start the
private sector economy in North Carolina, will create jobs, will provide
opportunity for our people, and will be something that will be
significantly better than the tax system that we currently have.
I'll be more than happy to answer any questions, Mr. President, and urge
you to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Is there any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Clodfelter, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Clodfelter has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, let me start by saying
I greatly appreciate and respect the amount of effort that's gone into
this bill. Trust me, I do. I know how much work and effort it has taken
to put a bill like this together, as it has been required for every
other proposal that we've seen this session and in prior sessions. So,
it's a good piece of work. It's a good piece of work to get it all
pulled together. I'll also say to you that an awful lot of this, in
fact, almost all of the elements of this bill are very familiar to me.
I've seen an awful lot of them before. I understand an awful lot of
them. I think I do, at least, better than I did when I first started out
on this exercise.
At the end of the day, though, the judgment that has to be made about
the bill doesn't lie in any particular piece of it. However familiar
that may be, or however good you may think individually, it's what they
all look like when the puzzle is assembled and the picture emerges as a
whole. And that's the basis on which I have to render my judgment about
the bill. There are, as I say, components of it that I think are quite
good, but the picture that comes out when all of the puzzle pieces are
put together for me is not one that I can support.
And I know it will be said that reform is largely something that is in
the eye of the beholder. I'm only one beholder, there are 49 other
beholders in here, and there are 120 beholders across the hall, and one
sitting up the street. So I'm only going to speak from the perspective
of the eye of this beholder. Why the picture that emerges from the bill
as a whole is not one that I can call, certainly not comprehensive, tax
reform. It violates in many respects quite a number of principles that
I've come to accept over years of studying and being an observer of the
issue, and a participant of the issue. And I want to talk about some of
those broad principles, as I say, because that's the judgment I render
based on those principles, and not on the details of the bill.
It is not, it is not revenue neutral. I don't think it pretends to be,
so I'm not going to sort of say that it fails in something that it
doesn’t pretend to do. But that's important. And I'll tell you why I
think it's important that a true restructure of the tax system should be
revenue neutral. It's because it's the only way you can avoid confusion
using tax reform with debates about budgets, spending levels, and
spending priorities. And tax reform ought to be about the design of the
system for raising the revenue. It should not be a debate about whether
we have enough, whether we have too much, or whether we should spend
more or spend less. Whenever you violate the principle of neutrality,
you inevitably confuse the debate and draw all of those other issues
into it. This bill is not revenue neutral.
In a year of full implementation it will generate 1.3 billion dollars
less than the current revenue system adjusted for inflation, with growth
adjusted for inflation of population growth. In other words, it will</p>

<p id="040:00">
Yield 1.3 billion less after you take into account inflation and
population growth than our current tax system will do today. And so that
means we’re all of sudden talking about budget issues in those years. I
don’t know what the debate will be. I may not be here. Ah, maybe I won’t
be here. Ah, but there will be a debate. There will have to be a debate
at that point about how we will fund that shortfall. It violates the
principle of neutrality and for that reason I can’t call it really tax
reform. It confuses tax and spending issues in the same bill. It is not
comprehensive. It does not address one of the main pillars of our
revenue system, the sales tax. It doesn’t address the sales tax in any
comprehensive way. Senator Berger’s quite correct. The sales tax we have
today was designed for and structured to respond to the economy of the
1930s. This bill does not update that design in any substantial respect.
One of the main pillars of our revenue system is largely untouched.
Where it is adjusted where the base on which the sales tax is calculated
and paid is adjusted it violates another key principle of tax reform. It
expands the tax base of the sales tax to cover more transactions that
are business to business transactions. That’s where the basic expansion
in this bill lies. In exactly the opposite direction of what every
expert on tax policy, on what every commentator, on what every business
has told us, don’t pyramid your sales tax by taxing business inputs and
business to business transactions. But the largest revenue gain in the
sales tax in this bill after the repeal of the current exemption for
sales tax paid by nor non-profits the largest gain in the tax base after
that is from the repeal of exemptions today that are granted for
business to business transactions for purchases of capital equipment,
raw materials and business inputs. That’s the wrong way to go on
comprehensive tax reform. The ah, bill is not balanced. It does not
yield a balanced revenue system. And that’s dangerous for the future of
the state as well. Currently our revenue system rests on four principle
taxes. There’s smaller ones but four principle taxes. Personal income
tax. Corporate income tax. Corporate franchise tax. And the sales and
use tax. This bill narrows the base of the state’s revenue system to
two. Principle revenue system sources, the personal income tax and the
1930s vintage sales tax which everyone has told us is going to continue
to shrink and yield less and less revenue to support the essential
functions of state government. So more reliance under this bill on our
weakest tax and more reliance on the remaining personal income tax which
is one of our most volatile taxes. Not one of our more stable taxes. One
of our more volatile taxes. So from year to year, ups and downs as the
econ, economic cycle progresses we’re placing more of our eggs in the
basket of a tax that is going to be more volatile through those business
cycles. That can work if you’re happy to have ups and downs in your
revenue system from year to year like we’ve had for the last couple of
decades. And have to come in here with every budget cycle and figure out
what do we do with this extra money, what do we do with this budget
shortfall from year to year to year. A good comprehensive tax reform
will stabilize the structure of the tax system. This bill does not do
that. I worry too about the principle of tax equity.  And I’m going to
talk about tax equity in, in the business context. As Senator Berger
correctly says there will be beneficiaries in the business community
from this tax bill if it passes. Those beneficiaries will by and large
be the largest corporate tax payers in the state. But when you sort
through the benefit from the repeal of the corporate income tax most of
which is paid by 40 or 50 very large corporations in the state and the
repeal of the corporate franchise tax most of which is paid by those
same large corporations in the state the residual business tax that this
bill will impo</p>

<p id="045:00">
The bulk of the revenue from that tax is very largely going to be paid
by medium size and small businesses in North Carolina. There will be a
shift in the tax burden, in the relative tax burden. Between the largest
business tax payers and the small business tax payers. I haven't had
enough time in the 48 hours we've had the bill before us, I haven't had
enough time really to do any in depth analysis or study of that
question. It worries me and I hope I'm proved wrong when more in depth
analysis of the bill can be done. When there is time for it, but I, I
penciled out last night several scenarios to try to get a sense of the
direction the bill was heading in that regard. Looking at a small
business say, a small town restaurant, or a small service business in
that same small town that may have three or four employees that
organizes an LLC and that throws off income to its owner who pays it
through the personal income tax. Quite frankly I couldn't find a
scenario in which that small business is going to better under this bill
than it would do under the current tax code or under many of the
competing proposals that have been offered. I do know that Bank of
America will do better. And that Nucor and Lowe's, and BB&amp;T they'll
all do better. I do know that. But what I'm really struggling to find is
conclusive evidence that the small business tax payer is going to do
better. And part of the reason if you'll stop and think about that, if
you'll stop and think about that, why that may be a worry that you
should have too is because a small business tax payer mostly pays his or
her taxes on his or her personal income tax return. The money passes
through to the personal income tax return. And when you start looking at
that return as you did last night and I say okay my business income
comes from my personal income tax return and yeah I've got a $15,000
zero bracket but I no longer have any personal exemptions for me, my
wife or my kids. I no longer have an ability to itemize the deductions
for my mortgage interest on my home or my property taxes that I pay, I
can't deduct the money that I give to my church anymore. When I did the
back of the envelope calculations on that I ended up with a higher tax
bill. I ended up with a higher tax bill even at a %5.25 rate. A higher
tax bill than most everyone of the competing proposals we've seen this
session. And even in some cases higher than the current tax code. I'm
worried about the equity in this bill between the big business and the
small business. And finally I wanna say something that maybe, it's not a
principle that's talked about as, as widely, it may be a personal
principle of my own, that is that we ought to, whatever we do here in
Raleigh, by way of reform of the state tax system. One principle I have
of tax reform is we ought to do as little harm as possible to local
governments. We ought to leave them at least, no worse off under what we
do here in Raleigh than they are today. Make it a little bit better
that'll be fine, but certainly leave them no worse off than we are
today. That principle is clearly violated by this bill. I think you can
see it in the analysis that's done, in the fiscal note with the bill. I
don't know how that flows through from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. I
can tell you from having worked on that question there are going to be
wide swings in the way this bill affects individual counties and
individual cities. And until you get down into that you're not gonna
know how it's all gonna turn out. But the bottom line on the aggregate
is not pretty. I agree with Senator Berger, I don't like paying food
tax. I'm perfectly happy not to pay food tax. I like getting rid of the
food tax. I like getting rid of any tax that I have to pay. But I'll
tell you one tax I don't like, anymore than I like the food tax. I don't
like the property tax. I really don't like that bill I pay every
September on my property tax. And I know that if the city of Charlotte,
which will lose 30 million dollars under this bill, if the city of
Charlotte has to get it somewhere, I know where they're gonna get it.
They're gonna get it by raising my property taxes. That doesn't make me
feel really very good about tax reform either. When I look at all of the
principles that I've just gone through on the bill and I look at the
alternatives that we have to do tax reform, I come to the conclusion
that this, again, can't be called a comprehensive tax reform bill from
North Carolina. It is a big tax cut, it is a big tax cut for large
corporations currently doing business in the state. And its a good tax
cut for people who, I guess fit in the.</p>

-a lot of people would put me in, fat cat lawyers.  I’ll do pretty well
but it’s not comprehensive tax reform.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
 [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill and send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you want to speak first and then send
forward your amendment?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could please sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, you have the floor to speak to the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, the Senate.  I too, like Senator Clodfelter and Senator Rucho
believe very strongly that tax monetization is needed. I’ve worked on it
for a long time.  I’ve been dishonored just like Senator Berger has that
we haven’t gotten there. But I must say that I’m not sure that what
we’ve got before us today is really where we should be.  And I want to
talk about one particular area that’s going to be impacted adversely
from this tax plan and that is the rural part of North Carolina.  And I
gave you two examples of how it would impact Carolina.	First is the
repeal of the sales tax exemption for the nonprofits would have a very
adverse impact on our hospitals.  In my area Vidant health care, which
is based out of Greenville, North Carolina has five rural hospitals in
my part of the world.  Those hospitals combined would have a net loss,
not loss revenue reduction, but net bottom line loss of 2.2 million
dollars in this bill.  We’d lose 250 jobs, we would lose 8 million
dollars that goes to the Brody School of Madison, and we would lose 70,
I mean 50 positions that are for interns that are coming out of the
Brody school at these hospitals.  Not to mention the health care that
would be lost to the citizens of that part of the world is that the jobs
that are in that area, these jobs are some of the best jobs that are in
that rural part of the state.  And another area that’s important to
rural North Carolina, and some people like them, some people don’t but
they’re a fact of life. And that is that you have mobile homes and you
have module homes and in this bill you’re increasing the sales tax on
both mobile homes and module homes.  Mobile home tax rates would go up
317% .  Module home taxes would go up 100%.  Our lesson yesterday in the
Senate finance committee: a Mr. Lou Ebert with a North Carolina Chamber
says amongst other things, that this tax bill was equitable.  And I’m
sorry Mr. President, but I have to say to Mr. Ebert, he needs to come
out of his glass tower and go over to Eastern North Carolina, or
rural	Western North Carolina, or rural Central North Carolina and look
around because this tax bill is not equitable for rural North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Mr. President, if I could I would like to send
forward an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator you can send forward
your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jenkins moves to amend the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] One second
Senator, while we get it up on the dashboard please.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jenkins, you have the floor to explain your amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? it’s on the dashboard.  This bill addresses some issues that
have to do with agriculture.  As everybody knows agriculture is still
our largest business in North Carolina; it’s a 70 billion dollar
business.  There’s several little clean up items within this amendment
which writes out two things that are really not used a whole lot today,
and that’s two things: tobacco flues and tobacco sheets.  But what it
really addresses is other parts of agriculture that were treated
differently that will be impacted by something Senator Clodfelter
mentioned earlier and that is business to business taxes.  This would
basically treat all forms, shapes, and fashions of agriculture the same
and basically what it does is it would take out of the it would keep the
exemption for commercial logging, woodchipping, and packaging items that
would have moved over from being exempt to refund it would ultimately
rephase that and I’ll be glad to answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any discussion or debate? Senator Berger, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Berger has the floor to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate, we appreciate Senator Jenkins offering this
amendment and we understand the importance of the agriculture-</p>

community to North Carolina, and to the rural economy of North Carolina.
Unfortunately, his amendment would put the bill out of balance and I
would ask you to vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none. Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Question for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Berger, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I thank you. As best I can tell, this bill is going to cost the General
Fund 5.3 billion dollars over the next six years. It isn't in balance by
any sense of that word. How does this amendment put it out of balance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Well, Senator Stein, you and I have a disagreement about what that cost
is. We would consider the number that you cited as a tax cut to the
people of this state. What the bill does overall is it generates
revenue, notwithstanding Senator Clodfelter's statement about revenue
neutrality. It actually generates more revenue year over year than we're
currently receiving. It just does not generate the amount of revenue
that someone would like to project that we would have, and some would
like to spend as we go forward. The way the amendment would put the bill
out of balance, is that the funding stream that is available would
actually be lessened as a result of this amendment. So if your complaint
and the complaint of those folks who have a problem with the bill is
that the bill itself does not generate enough revenue, this amendment
would actually make the bill generate less revenue. That's what I would
say is out of balance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment
1. All in favor vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote.
Barefoot, aye. Newton, no. Daniel, aye. 18 having voted in the
affirmative, and 29 in the negative. Amendment 1 fails. The bill,
un-amended, is back before the body.
Is there any further discussion or debate?

Senator Jackson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Jackson has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, Senator Jenkins'
amendment was a good amendment, but I've had a lot of conversations and
a lot of work on this bill, and I've had a lot of conversations with
Senator Rucho. Is this bill a perfect bill? No. Do I love this bill with
all my heart? Absolutely not. Do I love our current system better?
Absolutely.
But I've talked with my Ag-folks, and I've done a lot of soul searching,
and I've looked at all the exemptions we in Ag are getting. And to
Senator Rucho's benefit, he's right. As he's picked at me many times, we
get everything we've got exempted. And I got to listening to my small
towns, and to my small hospitals. They were going to be sort of
negatively impacted, if you look at it that way, from this bill. And
fair is fair. I don't know a single farmer that, especially the ones I
talked to, and I have spoken to a lot. And Senator Rucho knows that he
and I have had many conversations over the last six months on tax
reform, and Senator Rabin as well, and Senator Berger. But fair is fair.
And my folks, that I have spoken to, will support this bill. They say
it's much better than what the alternative was, and I would have to
agree. No offense to Senator Rucho, he and I disagree on this. And I
think the world of him, he's done a great job on tax reform, on trying
to get this to the table, to get it to this floor.
But folks, this is a work in progress in my opinion, and I fully support
this bill and I would ask that you do the same. Thank you.

[Speaker Changes] Senator Blue has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President and my fellow Senators, one of the
things that we’ve talked a lot about in this session, at least I’ve read
a lot about it in the press is public private partnerships. And there is
no entity in modern day society, in our society, that generates new
ideas, new thoughts, comes with the private sector to address issues
that we don’t have to address as a state on as broad of a scale as the
non profit sector in this state. Right now they provide more than
425,000 jobs in North Carolina, and for most of this session we’ve been
talking about job creation. We’ve given it good lip service. 425,000
jobs they provide. They do things that we’d ordinarily have to do on a
statewide basis, if they weren’t doing it. Whether its the 38 private
colleges and universities, whether its the hospitals, whether its the
multiple counseling groups that do things that we would do, whether its
the churches, and the church schools And think about that, you know, in
my district, I know churches that have been erected that cost 20-25
million dollars, and when I look at some of the educational programs
they’re pursuing, some of their various other ministries, they are
rendering a service far greater than anything that we would do, and we
would be spending 5-10 times as much to do it.  We would be creating a
separate bureaucracy to do it. And so when you start taxing non profits,
you start down a slippery slope, I know you’ve got provisions in this
bill that you’ll only tax those over a certain amount immediately, but
once you start down the slippery slope, you’ll keep sliding down it. And
for the life of me, I can’t understand why one of the biggest employers
in my district, Wake Medical Center, ought to have to pay taxes on the
same stuff that ?? Hospital is buying, and they’re doing the very same
thing, when Wake Medical Center is far exceeding the charity care, they
give more free service, more contributions back to the community then
probably any other hospital or health system in the state. Yet, this
bill will cause them to pay millions and tens of millions of dollars in
taking away tax exemptions. Although they do things that we would have
to do at the state level, if they were not there...</p>

Not just the medical care aspects of it but their coordination with all
of the other state social services, agencies and stuff in this county.
Now maybe you just don't like that particular non-profit, but if you can
really tell me why this health system ought to have to pay sales taxes
and Rex Hospital which is part of the UNC system does not have to pay
sales taxes, or basically can't deduct all of their sales taxes, I'd
really appreciate it. And you know, part of the effort over the years,
there are not a lot of publicly owned hospitals left because about 20,
25 years ago, the light-bulb went off and people realized that not for
profits could run these institutions than the governments that were
running it. And that's why they flourished, that's why they prospered
and that's why most hospitals in this state are owned by non-profits
now. Those that are still profitable and able to survive in this climate
that we're in. And so in this bill you're creating another uncertainty
in the health care factor. You turned down Medicaid which was a stress
on them. You're gonna start taxing the products that they buy which is
another stress on them, and I just can't for the life of me understand
it. But let me give you two other quick examples and I'll sit down and
shut up.
I mentioned the churches and there are huge churches in this county, as
many of you have huge churches in your counties. If you go on a serious
church building effort as many of them in Wake county have done, it's
not unusual to spend as I say, 10 million, 20 million dollars. And those
that have schools spend much more than that. Two of the successful
non-profits running schools in Wake county, Cary Academy. Exceptionally
good school. Raleigh Christian Academy, good christian based school, big
student population. They buy activity buses, they buy food, they do all
of that stuff for the hundreds of students that they have. And yet you
want to subject them to taxes. Why should they be taxed for doing the
same thing that we as a state are trying to encourage them to do and
educate kids in alternative ways, if we're not gonna tax the public
schools? They're doing the very same job. They're doing it cheaper and
they run very good service.
And I could go on and on about research organizations. I could talk
about the efforts that we make across this county to get everybody to
participate. The United Way and The Triangle group that pulls together
contributions for all of the non-profits by talking to the business
community in this state and ordinary people and everybody about
contributing and allowing them to take that charitable contribution
because it's doing the same thing only it's doing it usually better than
if they were paying it directly in a tax. And so they get a charitable
contribution for it and you've decided in this bill that you're going to
do away with that.
I'm just trying to find some of the equity that Senator Clodfelter was
talking about, not the equity, the equitable treatment that Senator
Clodfelter was talking about and I just don't see it in this bill. And I
hope that you respect and care enough about the non-profits in your area
that you'll at least rethink what this does to what has grown up to be a
tremendous institution in this state, and something that renders
invaluable service. That saves lives, develops people and makes the tax
that we would pay far less than what they would be.

To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much and I certainly appreciate the work that Senator Rucho
and Senator Berger and the others put into this tax plan. And whatever
you call it, it certainly isn't a tax reform. But what I see as one of
the normal people, not one of the wealthy business people or the lawyers
who make quite a bit of money. But the normal folks around here, the
gray in America group like Clark
Jenkins and Tillman and a few others. I may not be as old as you guys.
But anyway, the concern I have is about the elderly. And what we see in
terms of a tax plan that really is going to shift the burden away from
corporations and wealthy people to the middle class.
And when I think about people who have worked all of their lives, what
they look forward to as being able to retire with an ability to live at
least at the quality level they once had. And they count on that Social
Security and a little bit of pension to make it. And different from some
of you, don't have the ability to squirrel away some money and
investments that's not taxable so that they can have something to pull
on and shove in. There are people in my church and my community, folks
that I serve, who are not at that higher level and not quite at the very
bottom where they're going to be able to benefit from this proposed tax
plan.
But there are people in that middle group who have just enough to make
sure that they are going to be able to continue to pay whatever that
mortgage they may have because they sent some children or grandchildren
to college and now they aren't going to be able to deduct that interest.
And they are going to be able to buy some food and maybe take an
occasional trip or something like that. But what this does is decreases
their ability to be able to do that because they've got to pay some
taxes.
And different from what you're saying, Senator Berger, I have some other
information that shows a lot of other scenarios. A lot of other
scenarios. This is for a retired teacher whose income is about fifty
five thousand dollars with about twenty five thousand of that coming
from Social Security and the other coming maybe from some pension. That
tax of nine hundred dollars is going to double to eighteen hundred
dollars. And there are some other scenarios and I can show you where I
got them from too, if you want me to share. And there are some other
scenarios that I can give you where that person in that middle income
bracket who is elderly are going to have to pay the taxes.
And when we get to a certain point in life those of us who don't have
all of the money some of you all have, we look forward to having just
enough to be able to do some basic things and don't expect our state
government, that we have supported all of these years, to tax Social
Security, to tax our ability to live. And so I differ with you. I differ
with you in terms of, I don't have to talk about what Clodfelter talked
about. He's the expert in that area or
what Clark talked about. I can talk about average people. I'm average. I
may have a little bit more because I have this subsistence that you all
have but the folks I am talking about don't have that subsistence. ??
you to come down here and get their little money and add into the pot.</p>

Have that. They’ve just got to depend on that little pension and that
little social security to be able to make it. And when you tax that you
tax the quality of life for a lot of people in this state. Because
they’re in that middle income range and there’s a growing number of
them. There are fewer at the top. Even a smaller number at the bottom
but there are a lot of them in that range and this is very unfair to
them.

Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rich I have a ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rich who has the floor speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate.  I don’t think anyone
disagrees the tax reform is not absolutely essential. Especially
comprehensive tax reform. Senator Robinson talks about all of the folks
that have been struggling here in North Carolina. And you know what? She
is right. She’s absolutely right. But you think about it. When you
defend a status quo system that exists today that leads to, since 1997,
a decline in income, personal income.  Why that means that everyone’s
paycheck is absolutely less. And without significant fundamental changes
it doesn’t get better. We’re also talking about billions of dollars
Senator Robinson, billions of dollars on government assistance programs
figuring that’s the way to solve it, that’s the way to get people out of
poverty and yet all we’ve done is lock them into a life of poverty
because in reality it’s not got any better that way. So what that means
is maybe we shouldn’t do that way. In addition and Senator Berger
alluded to it earlier, fifth highest unemployment in the country despite
billions of dollars in incentive money that has gone in and other
efforts we’re still fifth highest unemployment. That is unacceptable.
What that means is the status quo does not work. Senator Clodfelter
talked about a lot of principals of tax reform. He learned it when he
went through, I learned it when I went through. I don’t think we
disagree a lot on the fundamentals. I think we may disagree on some of
the solutions and that’s fine. That’s what the debate in the senate is
all about. But, there are some problems that Senator Blue alluded to.
One is nonprofits. Well, ladies and gentleman of the Senate the state of
North Carolina spends 9.2 billion dollars on a tax expenditure. That
means,  And this is something we get a report from the department of
revenue, that’s goes out the back door and that has nothing to do with
the appropriations process of the senate and the general assembly. We
have no clue on one, really where that money goes, and what it also is,
is there is no accountability to determine. We give tax dollars to
charitable organizations because of deductions and all of this stuff
plus the sales tax refunds. We have no clue if that money is being used
right or wrong. There should be some accountability and that is one of
the reasons why Senator Blue we’re trying to find a way to solve that
problem. You talk about hospitals. Senator Berger, Senator ??? just
mentioned a few things about that. Golly I’m not sure how you call them
a nonprofit hospital. My son called me last night and read a story in
the Business Journal. He said dad, how does a nonprofit hospital earn
500 million dollars? I have a hard time explaining  that  question.
Especially when they have reserve funds of a billion dollars. Especially
where they have healthcare bills. And I’ll give you one example on my
end. My son had surgery. 26 thousand dollars for a three hour surgery.
That was like 45 minutes for the surgery it was all the fun time we were
in and that didn’t even include the doctors expense, the anesthesia, and
the like. We’ve got a problem in healthcare but that’s for another day.
But do you realize that non-profit hospitals pay only 1 tax . They pay
the state withholding, that part of it, the Medicaid. They pay no income
tax, no franchise tax, no corporate tax they don’t pay no property tax.
They don’t pay a penny. And yet, look at your healthcare bill. And you
tell me why it costs 3 bucks or 5 bucks for an aspirin. Someone needs to
find a solution to that problem. But surely</p>

<p id="080:00">
continually giving them a tax free rem is not the answer to that because
there's  no way maintaining accountability there, so that's the reason
why that kind of thing is going on in this bill and I have to say to
you, I am a full supporter of tax reform, comprehensive tax reform, I
have some problems with this bill. A couple of problems was mentioned
earlier, one it doesn't go far enough to solving the real problems. We
had a golden opportunity the other day when we had four economist come
together at the finance committee and spend time explaining what, in
their expert opinion, what is a solution to our economic problems, to
our status queue failed system born in the 1930s. Ladies and gentleman,
rarely do you get economist to agree about anything, rarely do you get
them to tell you a solution that isn't said well on one hand or the
other, they actually came out and they said this is what you need to go,
we believe its the best way to move and that's like getting advice from
your doctor. If you're sick you go to your Doctor and say, what is the
best way to get myself healed? If I have cancer surely I may have
chemotherapy, I may have surgery, I may have radiation, but the bottom
line, the tough medicine is you listen to the advice and hopefully
you're better at the end of it, and that's what we are trying to do with
comprehensive tax reform. other than the fact it doesn't reach the full
gamut that these economist said it should, which it should include a
comprehensive or a broad based sales tax on goods and services. I think
it was Dr. sawyer said &quot;its very hard when your only touching 1/3
of your GDP.&quot; and that means your trying to ride down the highway
with a 6 cylinder car only using 2 cylinders. Senator Graham I'm not
sure that's a very effective way to drive down the highway is it,
especially on the superhighways we have today, my feeling about this and
I hope, that if this bill passes, which I suspect it will, there will be
some additional additions to this, Senator burger eluded to, well let me
step back one more, there was one other major problem that I had with
this and that is planning for the future. There are a couple of ways of
growing our economy, one is with organic growth, meaning you support
small businesses as we did in the last biennium, we spent money, tax
money in the pockets of working families, of small businesses and the
like, and we created many thousand of good jobs for this state, but this
bill has one fundamental flaw because it flies in the face of what is
one of the principles, as senator cloudfel eluded to, and that's about
fairness and its also about the proper way the money should be spent,
and in this case, I didn't discuss it yesterday in my presentation for
the finance, but when the chamber of commerce came out and said we
endorse this bill, well my goodness, why wouldn't they? They represent
some of the top corporations in the state, they have actually, and think
about this now, fairness, simplicity, elimination of tax preferences and
loopholes are some of the criteria you look for, lowering tax rates of
coarse, retooling and creating economic growth and jobs, but one of the
cardinal principles you try to achieve is eliminating loopholes.
unfortunately, and one of the reasons why I'm going to oppose this bill,
despite the fact that I agree with most of it that's in this here, is
because of the fact that we are giving a 1.8 billion dollar loophole
when we go 0 on franchise tax and corporate tax. Something Clyde failed
to mention earlier, there is some sense of having a balanced approach to
this, that's not balanced, that is the wrong direction, and what it
really does, ladies and gentleman of the senate, is it prevents us from
really doing comprehensive tax reform in the future, it blocks it right
here because basically you've eliminated a lot of your options, and what
that 1.8 billion dollar loophole means is, the corporations get a break,
you hope they are going to invest in their state, the only way their
going to grow in your state is if you have economic growth and that
means disposable income in the pockets of the working families and the
hard working individuals, that's not really addressed here
unfortunately, but what it really does, is it takes care of about 80000</p>

<p id="085:00">
and gentleman as senator cloudfeld alluded to, there may be 200 of them
or so that really paid the bulk of that taxes, their tax liability is
broguht to 0 or pretty close, but what happens to the 400000 small
businesses? very limited help, if we can't grow our organic businesses,
our small businesses of the state, we lose one of the major tools of
solving our economic problem getting out of this recesssion, but it also
means the fact that millions of individual taxpayers and the small
businesses are going to be paying a higher rate, higher than it would
normally be necessary because of the fact that we actually
re-established a loophole. I know im talking about both sides, because
there are some good things I like in this bill, but there are some
things that are fundamentally wrong and I hope that we learn from the
discussion here today. I hope that the governer's listening and the
speaker of the house and the leadership team over there is listening
because of the fact that this is only, I don't even call it a beginning
point, I think it needs to be reformed and rechanged, hopefully over
there they'll do that, or maybe in conference we can accomplish that.
What I will tell you ladies and gentlemen, other systems have failed,
Other tax efforts and clodfelter failed, and about seven other groups
failed in this effort. It isn't easy, it's very complicated, there are
about 10000 arms to this octopus, but the fact of the natter is, you
need to be able to stand up against the special interest that are in the
process of saying &quot;Don't tax me, but tax everybody else&quot;,
until we can solve that problem,so I'll just say to you, members of the
senate, I do support a lot in this bill, because of the two fundamental
points of the loophole on corporate taxes and the fact that it doesnt go
far enough to really solve the underlying problems of this economy, and
that is to go to a consumption based sales and use tax, and I know
senator berger said we got to comprimise on this, unfortunatly you
should never comprimise on your principles, you should do what's right,
the people are expecting us to do what's right, and that means you gut
it out and you say &quot;This is the right thing&quot;, its hurtful for
people that have had tax preferences for a very long time, because they
have been given special tax considerations, what we're saying is its
time for everybody to be treated the same and treated fairly, and I hope
that this bill will go beyond where we are today to real meaningful,
truthful, comprehensive tax reform, thankyou

Mrs. President.
Speaker Changes
Senator Hayes, the floor is yours, senator hayes the floor to speak to

Speaker Changes
Thankyou Mrs. President, members of the senate. One thing I wanted to
talk about is, this process of tax reform is kind of interesting, it
definately moves a lot and is a, one of the fundamental issues you deal
with is that we budget and we forcast on a static process, which means
we make statements like we expect growth to be 3 % of the year over the
next 4 years, thats how we put those numbers out, the problem with it
would be kind of like looking at the stock market and saying that we
forcast growth at, since its history at 12%, so thats what we're
expecting to return every year. theres no accounting in these systems
for what may be new revenue sources, that are coming over as we expend
our oil and natural gas industry. Theres no account for changes in
population growth, theres no account for federal regulations, that may
change sales tax collections on internet sales and how that implies
where you broaden your base and how you move those, so the conclusion
ive come to is like regulatory reform, this is a process, its not
something we're done with today, but we will continue to move the needle
forward in reforming our tax process, but when we look at this step
we're taking now, if you want to sum up all of the problems in the state
of north carolina that we talk about in the budget and others, look to
your counties unemployment rates, look to the unemployment rate in the
state. You know its not hard to figure out that our ranking in
unemployment in this country, is within one of our ranking for our
business climate and their tax rates, were at the bottom of the scale on
both, I grew up in western north carolina, i grew up in a community
being one of the</p>

Tobacco is our number one industry. Followed by furniture, textiles,
health care, government employees. We've had teachers and police
officers that entire time period. But then we had a government problem.
Government money came into the system and destroyed the tobacco
industry. They were pretty blunt about it, they just bought it out. They
changed federal policies. We watched our furniture and textiles
industries leave. We've seen government become our number one employer
now, followed by health care. And over the last few days, I'm hearing
from healthcare like so many other of you have, that they only exist
because of the government money that's sent every year. That check that
comes back. Or they're gonna fall apart because we didn't give them more
government expansion. Or the affordable care act. It is time that we
start pulling government out of business operations. Because you look at
their track record, and I can show you their track record in my
community, and I can show you have government has destroyed business in
our community. So we're taking away the tools of how government destroys
business. Those business and franchise taxes.  How they make those
regulations, we're continuing regulation reform. Because the problem in
North Carolina is we don't have enough private businesses that are
hiring enough individuals to do the work. And with this bill, we change
that model. We become one of the best in the nation in our corporate and
business tax structure. We are not done with tax reform with this bill.
There are many things left to come that are important to North Carolina,
including expanding to a fair base so that we're not deciding on the
basis of what type of commerce you're in, whether or not that commerce
is taxed, and then we lower the rates involved in the base for everyone.
But this is an important, an incredible step we can take along the way
to fix what's really ailing North Carolina. Thank you all.

[Speaker Changes]
First of all, I don't see Senator Rucho, oh there he goes. I want to
publicly acknowledge him, he actually invited me to be on the finance
committee. And given my background, I think that was a very interesting
choice on his part. I knew that today would come, and I wasn't sure
exactly how it would. And he and I worked very hard together with many
others of you on the original thoughts about tax reform. I have also
worked very hard on this particular plan, and I do embrace it. I do
agree with Senator Hise. This is only the beginning. The part that I
focused on most was about our small businesses because I do understand
that they really are the key to the economic engine of this state. We
focused, I focused very hard on solid logistical implementation. One of
the things that I certainly agree with with Senator Rucho is that our
system now picks winners and losers. But you know, I don't fault
businesses for wanting to be winners. They are our job creators, and so
we had many businesses there who have taken a bad tax plan and have made
the best of it. And they've used to their advantages the exemptions and
the different types of special programs that we have. But we can not as
leaders of this state jerk the rug out from under our businesses who are
counting on those exemptions. And so if you look at the bill carefully
it transitions these, these programs, these exemptions, and gives our
businesses and other entities the opportunity to change their business
models, to take a look, and to compete in the new, under the new plan. I
do truly believe that this bill is a jobs bill as Senator Berger says.
It tells to the nation, no to the world, that North Carolina is getting
back to work. We will be innovating, we will be creating, and we will be
producing, because our businesses will be</p>

[Speaker Changes] Able to do so without the burdensome tax plan. I urge
your support for this bill.
[Speaker Changes] Senator McLauren, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Senator McLauren has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate. I
take a risk to stand up and speak as a freshman in the chamber. Most of
us, of course, are probably better off listening because of all the
experience of so many of you who have worked so hard on tax reform
through the years. Senator Berger I couldn't help but think about when
you commented in your introduction about you've been here since 2001, as
I mentioned to you a few weeks ago, I'm sitting in seat 44, where
Senator Berger started his freshman year here in this chamber. Senator
Rucho,  Senator Rabin, Senator Clodfelter, Senator Hartsell, so many of
you have worked so hard to bring us to the point where we could talk
about tax reform. As a freshman, though, I think I have a perspective on
it and I appreciate Senator Hise and Senator Barringer who were
commenting about business and I wanna speak about that in a moment but I
also wanna speak about a concern that I have about this bill from the
standpoint of our local governments;. I served 15 years as a mayor in my
hometown of Rockingham and Richmond County, a community struggling with
high unemployment as most of your communities are and what I'm afraid
we're doing with this bill is pulling the rug out from under local
governments and our citizens in the respect that more of the tax burden
is gonna be shifted to our local governments as a result of this bill
and that concerns me greatly. And I just wanna comment a little bit
about that because all of you, I know, have seen the information that
has been provided by the legal municipalities and I remind you though
that we're partners in this process: the cities and the counties, we
created them here, my predecessors did, these 520 cities and towns
across the state, 100 counties in North Carolina, we created them here
in the legislature, they didn't just decide they wanted to be a county
or decide they wanted to be a town, they had to come to us and get our
permission for that to happen. So we're partners with them and they
provide some essential services: police protection, fire protection,
water, sewer, industrial parks, local incentives that thats necessary to
try and create jobs, recreation is another one that all of us can relate
to that so many times are provided by our local governments and we can
all ride around in our neighborhoods and communities that we live in and
see examples of pubic recreational opportunities that are provided to
our young people and to our seniors citizens as well but this budget, or
tax bill is gonna require that many of these communities raise their
property taxes to be able to provide those essential services like
public safety, like law enforcement in our communities that we live in,
that we depend on. I looked over my district last night, and it ranges
from a 4% to over a 30% increase to make up for the lost revenue.
Lernberg, which is a community struggling with one of the highest
unemployment rates in the state, the Mayor sent me a message last night,
almost over 18% property tax increase to try to make up. Senator Allran,
I know he just walked out but he speaks often in committee about the
impact on local communities, there he is. And I saw Hickory, over 11%
impact to Hickory. Senator Payden I know is former Mayor, Goldsboro in
his district over 7%, almost 8% impact and increase. So, why do
companies choose North Carolina? Thats a legitimate question, I'm a
private business man, I've served as mayor, I've worked with a lot of
businesses in our communities to help them expand and create jobs. Why
do they do this? Many times its because of the quality life. The quality
of life in those communities, and those communities, provide that. Those
cities, those counties, they provide that quality of life.</p>

we’ve all heard many times before. Former Speaker of the U. S. House Tip

burden, a property tax burden to them. As a businessman I’m concerned
about what that impact is gonna be on the property that we operate in

thing. And, and at that time I think try to come up with the best plan
that they could and kinda ran into a dead end. When, when I think people
started looking at the bill short-sidedly/g and, and take a look at what
it means today, not what it means four or five years from now. And I
think that’s true with any tax package. If you look at it today you’ll
pick them all apart. I don’t think it matters what we produce. If you
just look at it today, you’ll never pass a tax reform bill. It will be
absolutely impossible to pass one. I think you’ve got to be able to take
a look in future at what it may mean to the state four or five years
from now in order to get that done. And you know when I look at North
Carolina you know we’re all ranked 44th in tax climate. And it don’t/g
take much knowledge to understand why when you look at what our
corporate rate is. It’s the highest in the Southeast and our income tax
rate’s the highest in the Southeast. You know it just makes good sense
why we’re ranked there. And also look at commerce and how we look at
recruiting businesses to the state. That’s an interest I have and been
involved with. And I think North Carolina is a great place to live. But
if I’m a business lookin’ to relocate and I would say there’s a lot of
them trying to do that maybe in Illinois or California or maybe in some
other states that their tax policies are even worse than ours. The first
thing they’re gonna look at is the tax policy. That just makes good
sense. And as they look at what states have to offer, if your policy is
not a very good policy then they cross you out. You’re out of the game.
You’re not even considered. And that’s exactly what’s happening in North
Carolina in my opinion and why our unemployment rate has continued to be
at the rate that it is. And why North Carolina has been so slow to
recover from the recession is because we’re just not competitive. It’s
just a fact. I don’t think anybody in this room could argue that point.
We are not competitive with our tax policy. And so I‘s using an example
in the finance committee yesterday if you look at the auto industry
which I’m in, if you look at the manufacturers that have located in the
Southeast, they’re located in every state around us. But they’re not
located in North Carolina. And why not? It’s because of our tax policy.
We didn’t cut, we didn’t make the cut. We weren’t there. South Carolina
found a way to attract one. Tennessee’s got one. Other states. Alabama’s
got ‘em. Everybody but us attracted an auto manufacturer to their
states. And their major employers in other states today. But it’s
because of their tax policy. Nothing else. And to be a commerce
secretary in this state and try to recruit business I think the question
you've gotta ask ‘em they consider North Carolina is what’s it gonna
take for me to get you here? How much money have I gotta give, give you
to buy your business to come to North Car</p>

<p id="105:00">
A lie. That's the position we're in today. It's not that you can sell
our tax policy, because you can't. That doesn't work. So our recruitment
efforts come down to what have I got to give you, what have I got to pay
you, to buy you, to come to North Carolina. That's our policy right now
in North Carolina. And that's a losing policy that will never, ever win.
Again, this bill is not perfect. I'll be the first, I said it in
finance, I think Senator Hise has said it, that it is not perfect. And
if I thought that this was the end of tax reform, I don't know that I
would support the bill, to be quite honest. If I thought this was it,
nothing else was coming, I couldn't support this bill. But I do know
this. I know five years ago there was an attempt to do tax reform. I
think it's been about five years, Senator Clodfelter. And that didn't
happen. And here we are five years later, and now we're trying again. If
we don't pass a tax reform bill of some kind this year, I, I said it in
finance, and I think it'll happen, it'll be ten years before we try
again. Because I don't think anybody will have the nerve or the, the,
the will or whatever it takes to go through the process of tax reform,
to, to go through these issues, and be able to come up with a plan that
you can get everybody to agree, when on the front end, you can pick them
all apart. And that's exactly what's happening in here tonight, or
today. We're picking each little pieces of this tax reform, and we just
pick it apart. And that's why you're gonna vote against the bills,
because you don't like this piece or that piece or whatever. But what
that tells me is that you like the status quo. And the status quo don't
work. It has not worked, it's put North Carolina in a terrible position.
And for me, the status quo is, is the worst answer to this, to this
problem we have. And I don't have to, it takes bold, it takes boldness,
sometimes, to do something. And, and it takes foresight, I think, to do
something. And for me, I'm trying to look at it four, five years from
now, [??] this state will be with this tax reform. Not what it means
next week, because if I look at it next week, I'm gonna push a red
button. That's exactly what I'll do if I look at it next week. But if I
look at it four or five years from now, then I push the green button,
because that's the difference I think it'll make for this state.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, Senator Rabon, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister President, speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabon has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't speak often. Generally, it's when I'm
spoken to. I'm a man of passion, I'm a man of very firm convictions and
opinions, and I normally keep most of them to myself. Known pretty much
as a happy go lucky guy. Let me tell you something, I've heard a lot of
numbers today, I've heard a lot of mumbo jumbo. Some of it's true, some
of it's not. And I'll address some of the untruths and I'll address some
of the truths, and then I'll shut up. And I'll vote for the bill after I
do. But here's the way it is, folks. If you're living on Social Security
and that's all you're living on, you will not pay one penny's tax in
this state, other than your property tax. You will owe this institution
nothing. You won't pay for tax on  your food, you won't pay income tax
on your Social Security check. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
That's a fact. Number two, if you grew up as I did on tobacco road, and
you like it, then get ready. Because statistics show that in 2020, we
will be at the same place in North Carolina as we were in 1970. Well
1970 was pretty darn good in [??], and in Robeson County and
Proctorville. Even in Laurinburg. Pretty darn good. But it ain't 1970
today, folks. But that's where we're headed. So if that's where you
wanna go back to, then go right on. But I can tell you this, as long as
I'm in this body, as long as I have anything to do with the leadership
of this state. We're gonna go in a different direction. We talk about
putting things back on the town, this and that. Let me ask a question.
Do you think going down the path that</p>

?? Robinson County, in Columbus County, in Laurinburg fifteen, eighteen,
maybe even twenty-five percent unemployment.  How many? How many
businesses are going to move there?  How many businesses want to live in
those conditions?  If we sit on our laurels, it will only get worse.
Why can’t we attract major manufacturing in this state?   Senator Brown
hit it.  We have to pay them.  We have to prostitute our state to get
people to come to it.  That’s ridiculous.  We have a plan before us that
will put us number one in the nation.  Number one in the nation in
corporate tax.  Ask any, any economist worth his or her salt.  Ask the
four that spoke to us the other day.  One of the single biggest drivers
of the economy, the single thing we can do, for the best bang of our
buck to attract business. Every one of them will tell you unequivocally,
and they will argue on other subjects, the corporate tax rate.  We will
be number one in this nation.  We will go from mediocrity to being
ranked sixth in our overall tax plan.  Now, you can all come up with
something for a reason and a darn good reason not to vote this bill and
any other bill we can come forward with.  But I can tell you this, don’t
blame me and don’t blame the others like me who have the fortitude to go
forward and who are not scared of the dark to vote for it and take us
into a new era and into the bright light of tomorrow. Thank you.

Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senators, before we move on here, I want to recognize a large group that
came into the gallery, the Institute for Future Agricultural Leaders,
and the Farm Bureau Youth Leadership Group.  We thank you for being with
us today during this good debate.  So thank you for coming into the
Senate.
Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker Change]
The bill we have before us today is not the bill we were promised.  We
were promised a bill that would broaden the base.  We were promised a
bill that would lower the rate.  We were promised a bill that would
essentially be revenue neutral.   Only thing we have here today is a
piecemeal approach to what I understand will be tax reform.  But it’s
not tax reform.  We need to approach this comprehensively.  We need to
do all those things that are necessary so when the next recession comes
we won’t be more volatile in terms of our revenue streams that are
coming to us.  If this bill passes and we cut our revenue streams the
way we have, and we do not broaden the base which we have not done, we
will be more volatile not less volatile to the whims of the economy.  We
need to really take this on and tackle it in a way that is aggressive, a
way that is meaningful and looks at totality of what this state needs to
move forward.  And I am disappointed that this bill does not do that.
When we talk about our corporations, in my mind, this is taking a step
backwards.  It’s regressive.  Yes.  Can we do better for our corporate
tax rates?  Absolutely.  But do we treat corporations that have five
employees and might have an income of $100,000 a year the same way we
would treat corporations with a 1000 employees that might have $20
million in profit? Why should they all pay $5,000? That’s regressive.
That’s unfair.  That penalizes our small businesses.   And our small
businesses are our economic engines that create the jobs, the
entrepreneurship, the ones that lead to prosperity in this state most
significantly.  So when we ?? a bill that treats those small businesses
with five, ten, twenty employees and charges them the very same tax we
charge the largest employers in our state, we are moving in the wrong
direction.  When I look at the impact on our cities and our town, we
look at the revenue that is going to be shifted to them to make up.
It’s fine to say that we are going to go…</p>

all they did was move one school board member from one district and
another school board member into another district. They also changed the
election from the primary to the general. Neither of those changes are
problematic, what remains problematic is this bill. Wake was the only
school board district in the state that hired an outside political
consultant to draw its maps after the 2010 redistricting. The only.
Drawn to favor Republicans and yet the republicans lost. This bill is
nothing more than a political effort to rejigger the districts to favor
Republican candidates for the school board. You all saw the map and you
saw how ridiculously gerrymandered those districts were. It goes all the
way from Brier Creek, all the way around the county to Garner.  We're
moving away from compact districts to something that has no relationship
to schools and how school kids track from elementary to middle school,
to high school. Please, if you respect our children's education, vote

Senator McKissick, do you yield? Senator McKissick, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, you mentioned legal municipalities. Let me get this
straight. You’re in favor of keeping the food tax and you’re also in
favor of allowing a municipality to put a gross receipts tax on a
company also to get more money in for them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Senator Apodaca, I’ve always felt the food tax was regressive. I
would say that if we could completely repeal everything related to food
taxes that’s the way to do it. We don’t need to have them, because those
with the lowest-income groups will spend more of their money on food and
resources of that sort than others.
So, I think to the extent there were zero, no food tax whatsoever, that
would be the best way to approach it because of its regressiveness on
low and moderate-income individuals. It consumes a higher percentage of
their incomes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, one more question for Senator McKissick please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me be more specific. In your study with the legal municipalities,
the municipalities like Senator Allran’s a couple of others that are
really affected by this are those who put a gross receipts tax on the
privilege licenses, is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that would likely be correct.

Senator Ford you were too slow with your light. Get your light on faster

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to share with this body. The
Department of Commerce, that’s Governor McCrory’s Department, presented
us with a list from, “Site Selection” magazine that reported the
following reasons companies who have chosen North Carolina stated in
order.
The reason I wanted to bring this to your attention is because there’s a
contradiction from what I’m hearing from leadership and the Governor’s
Department.
Number one, the companies said that the reason why they moved to the
State of North Carolina is that we are a right-to-work state, 69 percent
of the respondents. If I’m not mistaken, that was accomplished under
Democratic control.
Number two is local incentives, 68 percent. Number three, our abundance
and availability of skilled labor. Number four, labor costs. Number
five, training programs, thanks to our great community colleges.
Number six, state tax exemptions and credits. Number seven, occupancy
and construction costs. Number eight, which is what we don’t talk about
enough in this room, is energy availability and cost. Number nine, the
availability of buildings and sites. Number 10, transportation
infrastructure, roads, routes, proximity to airports.
Number 11, Mr. President, and number 12, corporate tax rate. 39 percent
who responded said that they reported that this was a factor for them.
Number 11 and number 12. Ladies and gentlemen I submit this information
to you and again this is coming from our Governor’s Commerce Department.
Thank you.

Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Ford a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would be more than happy to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, if North Carolina has one of the worst corporate and
business tax structures in the state why would that ever be a reason a
business would choose to come here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, I would have to get you to ask the Department of Commerce.
This is their list. Right now we’re not on the same page with that
Department.

Senator Hise has the floor to speak to the Bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quite literally when we survey companies in this state and say, “Why did
you come here,” they’re never going to put our corporate tax rate on
that list, because it’s horrible. I want to wait until we fix that
system in North Carolina…</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To make sure I'm not the only person  who doesn't

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to share just a brief story. You need to get on
Main street. Now we do a lot of good work and I appreciate everything
that everybody does in here, you but you need to get on Main street, you
need to get out there in the market, you need to understand what's going
on. You need to sit across the table with an industry and they look
right at you as you're trying to do your best to sell this state and to
sell your region, and they look right at you and they say, Senator - and
it this time it was Rick because I was looking into real estate
transactions, he says, we're concerned about your taxes. Senator we're
concerned about your taxes! I said, what's your concern? We're looking
at [??] taxes to relocate.
Now folks, we can get stats. Thank you Senator Ford, that's great, good
stats, thank everybody for sharing these stats. But I'm telling you, you
need to get out there on the street and be in front of these people and
understand that this is in the forefront of business opportunities. I am
living it. You know what the real estate business has been through, you
know what it is. Don't you Senator Walters? You know. Senator Tucker do
you know what it's cost you in business because we are not an
environment that works? I'm telling you this plan is going to be a game
changer and it is the start, but I just got to tell you, if you get out
there on the street and you listen and you're out there face to face
with these companies that are looking at trying to expand and trying to
locate here, their concern is taxes. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members of the Senate, we've
heard a lot of discussion. I'd like to say what this bill is not, and
that is tax reform. Senator Clodfelter I think did an excellent job
arguing that point persuasively. Your own finance chair has argued that
he's not gonna vote for this bill because  it does not represent
comprehensive tax reform. And tax reform is one of those issues you
don't do piecemeal, you can't do it piecemeal. Senator Apodaca was
asking Senator Mckissick about civic taxes, you ask any one person about
any one tax, guess what? They're against it. They should be because no
one tax is good, we all don't want to pay taxes, but we also recognize
we have to pay taxes, we have to fund the business of the state. what is
that business? Educating kids, having an excellent community college and
university system, building roads, having public safety, providing
healthcare for our people. Guess what that is? Those topics are 90% of
the state budget.
So do I want to have these taxes, do I want to have them? No, I don't
want to have any one of them. But do we have to have some taxes? Of
course we do. And you can't go just cutting individual taxes, that's not
tax reform, that's picking favorites. This is not tax reform, it is a
tax cut for the wealthiest among us and for large profitable out of
state corporations, that will be paid for on the backs of the average
tax payer here in North Carolina. Let's looks at the winners and losers
of this proposal. It's gonna cut about eight billion in income franchise
in state taxes over the next five years, and raise 3.7 billion in sales
and privilege taxes. Who are getting those eight billion dollars in
cuts? Well, that's pretty straight forward, the wealthy and large
corporations. An analysis by the Budget and Tax Center shows that 75% of
the benefits go to the wealthiest 5% of the population. Half of the
benefit of your tax cuts goes to the top one...</p>

Percent of the people in this state. Those are people earning $393,000
or more. Senator Apodaca said do we know how much the top earners at ??
get paid. I expect it’s around a million bucks. It’s a lot of money. So
why are you cutting their taxes by tens of thousands of dollars? They
don’t need a tax cut. Yet you’re giving people who earn that amount of
money a massive tax cut. Who’s paying for the shift that you all are
doing, in terms of who’s getting these tax benefits? Well, we’ve heard
from my colleagues. People who own property. Property owners in small
towns and large cities and counties across the state are going to see
their property taxes go up because of your bill. Patients who no longer
receive health services at hospitals that are forced to cut critical
services because they don’t have the revenue to pay for it. Hospitals
are large, complex organizations. But you failed to expand Medicaid,
they’re no longer getting compensated for people who don’t have health
insurance, they’re having to deal with changes as a result of the
Affordable Care Act, so what are you all doing? You’re going to throw
repealing the sales tax refunds that they get on them. Those are
employees of hospitals who will lose their jobs, and patients who will
no longer get services, because of your tax bill. Non-profits, other
non-profits and churches can no longer get the benefit of people who
give money and get a charitable deduction. They are going to suffer
because of your tax bill. North Carolina has never taxed Social
Security. Under this bill, for the first time, we are taxing Social
Security to the extent that it’s taxed by the federal government. We
heard Senator Robinson talk about that issue. There are 900,000
hard-working North Carolinians who benefit from the Earned Income Tax
Credit, which you all in this bill are allowing to expire. 900,000
people you are raising the taxes. In fact, by factoring in the
elimination of the Earned Income Tax Credit, your bill actually
increases taxes on the bottom 40% of earners in North Carolina, at the
same time you’re giving half of the benefit of your tax cut to the top
1%. Folks, this is upside down. People are struggling in this state. And
the ones who are struggling are not those earning $393,000 or more. The
biggest cost is going to be borne by the people of this state. We’ve
already seen the consequences of your cuts for this biennium. 700
million you all are cutting in this biennium. 4500 TAs, 4800 teacher
positions eliminated. Financial aid for 10,000 students, gone. Tuition
up for community colleges. Critical economic development initiatives
abandoned. Why? Because you’re choosing to give 700 million dollars in
tax cuts this year. That’s all bad enough but you all are taking the
easy way out. Oh my goodness, let’s take 700 million out of this budget
and see what the consequences are. But let’s push into the future 2.3
billion in the next biennium and another 2.6 billion in the biennium
after that. 1.3 billion every year. So over the next six years, y’all
have only identified 12.5% of the billions of dollars we’re going to
have to take out of this budget. The easiest thing a politician can do
is make a promise in the future, no make a promise today, but make that
cost get paid by somebody else in the future and that is what you all
are doing. We are writing a check, you are, to the tune of 1.3 billion
every year, that’s going to come be paid through worsening
infrastructure. Larger class sizes, fewer teachers, less pre-K
education, degraded universities and community colleges, diminished
public safety. That is the price of the bill before us today. And we’ve
heard talk, oh we’re just slowing the rate of growth, that’s not
actually a tax cut, we’re just slowing the rate of growth. That rate of
growth is pretty basic. What it is, is inflation, which exists, and the
population increase.</p>

People are moving to this state. I know y’all want to harp on how bad
North Carolina is, and by the way the one thing that all four of those
experts said the other day is don’t be swindled by these lists. The tax
foundation, their entire criteria is how low can you go? If you go down
to the bottom, guess what. You’re going to go to the top of their list.
That’s not how you make policy, on where the tax foundation ranks you.
What you do is you make policy on what’s best for the people of this
state. You all are cutting that money off of that baseline. The baseline
is just inflation and population growth. A lot of self congratulation, a
lot of self praise, for tackling this tough issue of tax reform. There
is no tackling of tax reform today. Y’all are doing the easiest, easiest
thing to do. Cut taxes but let the future people of this state pay for
it. I urge you to oppose this legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca has the floor to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I am
always in, well what do you call it when I hear the righteous
indignation on the back row and call it out. You know folks we’ve got a
basic, we’ve got one basic thing here. There is one decision we’ve got
to make here. Are we a state that’s going to be guided by government or
are we a state that’s going to be by, taken forward by business. It’s
that simple. It’s not complicated. We can hear all the talk. We can hear
about buying farm equipment and losing our tax exemption. Well when I go
buy a copier, I still pay taxes. I never thought to call my attorney to
talk about my tax situation. So I call my accountant. That’s what
they’re for. And I went over it with my accountant. Yes, I have 3 LLCs,
a Sub-S and a C. And he said, this plan will probably cost me more but
not a whole lot, because I’m already paying taxes as a business person.
But they key, the key what we’re trying to do, is get more people
employed. We’re not looking for more tax revenue. We’re not looking for
more incentives. You know, if you get people employed, it takes care of
almost 90% I’d say of problems we have as a society. So it’s not
complicated. It really isn’t. We hear east and west played against each
other. We have gone with the failed policies over the last 20 years and
seen no improvement east and far west. Correct me if I’m wrong. I keep
hearing that. But you know, government’s got to help. Government’s going
to help. Well it hasn’t changed anything. Those folks out there are
struggling. You know the best we can do is find a way to get them
employed. Or they may have to do as Americans have done and what they’ve
done for centuries, is move to where the jobs are. And I’m sorry but
that what’s we’ve always done as a society. We’ve gone to where work
presents. We talk about taxing non-profits. Why should I as a tax payer
subsidize non-profits? Why should I subsidize the Duke Endowment which
has a balance of 5.6 billion dollars? They do phenomenal work. They do.
I’m a Methodist. I know what they do for the Methodist church and
everything else. But 5.6 billion and they’re upset about a tax
exemption. You know, I’m sorry about Wake Forest. I’m sorry about
Davidson. But you know what? I’m having a hard time finding a lot of
sympathy. So my concern is educating the kids of North Carolina and
looking after our schools. We could go down the path, but when I hear
quotes from the budget and tax center, oh please. Please. You know, what
[LAUGH] I don’t even want to go down that path. Let them deal with what
they want. Folks, it’s simple. Do you expect government to take North
Carolina or do you expect business? And if you expect business, you’ll
vote for this. If you don’t, vote against it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Brown, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator
Stein a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, I’m an
automobile dealer. How do you look at me as a business owner? Do you see
me as a big business, a small business, a mid-size? What’s your
impression as a business owner? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re a small
business. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Small business. I agree. And I’m going to
tell you a little bit about my business, if I could. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, would you like to speak to the bill, or [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me speak to the bill.</p>

<p id="140:00">
...Senator Brown has the floor to speak to the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm a small business owner. I have about a 115
employees in Jacksonville. During the recession, I had to lay off about
30 people. Got down to about 80 employees during the recession. Been
able to hire some of them back. They help my business does. I collect
the highway use tax. I collect title and registration fees. I collect
sales tax. And the State pays me nothing to collect any of those. A
matter of fact, I get an audit once in awhile to make sure I've
collected it right, and if I don't, then I pay a penalty because I
didn't. So that's what happens to me. As far as property tax goes. I
paid the City of Jacksonville this past year about $55,000 in property
tax for my business. I pay the County of Onslow about the same. About
$55,000 in property tax. I paid about $25,000 this year in privilege
tax. In privilege tax to have my business. My payroll at my dealership
is about $450,000 per month. I pay $450,000 a month to my employees. My
debt on my business, I got a debt that I pay about $40,000 a month to
pay for my buildings that I operate in. I have a balance on that about
$3 million. Worry about it every single month, especially when I'm up
here trying to fit this stuff.
And yet we sit here and we talk about how bad the business guys are. And
yet I'm willing to take the chance to borrow the money, to go out there
and borrow that money, risk everything I've got because I have to put it
all up to borrow the money. If you can get a bank to loan it to you
right now. Put it all on the line. My homes, everything else I own,
employee that many people and provide them a good paying job. Provide
health insurance. I pay $30,000 a month in health insurance for my
employees, $30,000 a month. And with the Affordable Care Act about to
kick in, my folks have been telling me that's going to go up another
$10,000 a month. So I've got to try to figure that piece of it out here
shortly.
And yet I hear this and a business guy is talked about like I'm just
such a bad guy. You know? We're just a bad guy's because we might get a
tax break. I've never had one. Matter of fact, my business contributes
to recruiting other businesses to this State today. Because I've never
gotten a tax break as a small business owner. But I pay taxes, a lot of
taxes that go to recruit other businesses to this State.
And yet we're crucified as business owners when I've got everything I
own at risk every single day to stay in business. Senator McLaurin,
you've got the same thing. Senator Walters, same thing. Us small
business owners risk it all. Take all the chances like all business
owners do and yet we're the bad guys.
And trying to recruit businesses to this State is not easy. And yet if
you want to give them a tax break to get them here and let them come in
here and invest hundreds of millions of dollars, in most cases is what
we're talking about. Put everything they have on the line, risk it all.
That's a bad thing. I just don't get that. And you know if my business
wasn't in place in Jacksonville and those 115 people didn't have jobs
and if Senator McLaurin's business wasn't in place and he probably
employees, I don't know, 15 or 20 people probably, 30 people. I don't
know where they would work.
You know, us business guys, I tell you, we get beat to death to be quite
honest. And I think we do a whole lot for this State and I just, you
know, I just get so tired of hearing the negative on business people.
And Senator Jenkins, you're one. You understand it. We offer a lot to
this State and we don't mind paying our fair share, but you know, to be
crucified in a lot of cases as the bad guy because, you know, we may try
to get a break for somebody, it just gets tough around here, to be quite
honest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, you have the floor to speak a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, I am utterly sincere when I thank you
for doing what you do. I know you work hard. I know a lot of families
depend on the success of your business. And a lot of you, Senator
Tucker, you're in the same spot.</p>

<p id="145:00">
Senator McLaurin, Senator Jenkins. Y’all do great work. I never
crucified anybody. What I said was, the way you all have shaped this tax
plan, is you are giving 50% of the benefit to the top 1%. The
out-of-state, the corporate income tax rate, which you’re drawing down
to zero, 90% of that benefit goes to out-of-state corporations. I am all
about supporting North Carolina businesses. But to take a corporate
income tax rate that has oh, it’s at six-something, and take it to zero,
there’s a lot of numbers between six and zero, that can make North
Carolina more competitive. But you all are choosing to go to the most
extreme. And for whose benefit? These out-of-state corporations? It’s
not for you. Well, enjoy it. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President, to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, you
have the floor to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President and members of the Senate. Two or three things that have
struck me today and with a little trepidation, I’m going to try to bring
us back to reality a little bit. Sometimes we get into one little area
of what we do up here and we just get myopic and we forget what the big
picture is, and I think Senator Ford tried to bring us back to reality a
little bit, but I haven’t seen the numbers lately. But for ten years,
for a ten year period, as recently as I believe last year or the year
before, we were ranked by Forbes Magazine as one of the best places to
do business in this country. Or we were ranked in the top five. And it’s
because of a lot of things. And we’ve always had this tax rate problem.
That’s why we were trying to solve it five years ago and so was
everybody else. And still we were ranked as one of the best places in
this country to do business. Now if you all tell me that today we’re
48th in the country and whether people want to come here and do business
or not, I want to know what you did in the last three years to get us
there, because that’s when it occurred. And I think you’re going to find
you’re still one of the best places to do business. I’m not blaming
anything on you at this point, because I haven’t seen the latest
rankings that are comprehensive rankings on this state. Second thing, I
heard, I’ve heard a couple of things said this week that were a little
bit disturbing to me, and Senator Hise mentioned a little while ago that
the largest employer is public employees. Second largest is non-profits.
I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I believe that was what he said
to us. And apparently we’ve declared war on both now. Now I’ve known for
some time we’ve been after the public employees, and we’ve gotten rid of
a lot of those. But now we’re after non-profits? And we went after
cities, and that was public. I mean, we, you all acknowledged you were
after cities. Now you’re after non-profits? They employ 450,000 people
in this state. They run our hospital systems. Exactly what is your plan
to replace them? Well, let’s see. The public can’t do it because we
don’t want public employees. And they can’t do it. What are we going to
do? What are we going to do for rural hospitals? And while we’re after
non-profits, it’s the churches too. Who’s going to do that? I guess
we’ll have businesses that go into business to run churches? Strange
model to me, maybe it’ll work. We’ve got to get back in touch with
reality. This whole thing is about a lot of things. And if Senator Hise,
if we do away with the community colleges, where there are public
employees, you’re going to lose businesses coming into this state
because you won’t have any job creation, and some of the people in this
room</p>

<p id="150:00">
And they're gonna lose their job. That's public employees. If we get rid
of the public schools those are public employees, and if we get rid of
police and fire protection those are public employees. Who's gonna do
it? And we need to get a grip and try to figure out what piece of this
pie each of us needs to do. We cannot destroy one another. And Senator
Brown, I promise you - and I listened closely today on this business
piece. I don't think anyone has vilified business in here. if they have
on the back [??] I apologize for them and I  will tell you they didn't
intend to. We've talked about in our caucus about this bill in great
detail and one of our chief concerns is if we're not paying any
attention to small business, we're paying all of our attention to big
business.
They will tell you in recruiting, this has been knowledge for 20 or 30
years up here, the elephant hunts where we go out and get people to come
to this state, we are lucky if we replace the ones we lost. You do not
get job growth by going out and recruiting somebody to move to North
Carolina, period. That is a fact. At least I've been told it's a fact as
long as I've been here. We create job growth with small business. North
Carolina people creating jobs, just like your business. And that's who
we want to try to help. It's the farmers, it's the contractors, it's the
car dealers. And when I walk down my Main street I don't see a CEO from
some major company talking to me about what he's gonna do to move here.
What I see is people who are in Seabo up my way, they don't even like
our Chamber of Commerce, they've got their own Chamber of Commerce.
They're small business people. Firebrands if you will. and those people
need help. They couldn't get loans for the last four or five years, if
they had one it was called on them. They did need some help with
regulation, and there are lots of ways we can help these people.
The problem is this bill doesn't do that. If you look at where the
burdens under this bill are, small business will have to absorb some. I
hate to tell you this, some of you may think you're bigger than this,
small business is middle class America. That's who they are. They're
just regular people out there doing regular things trying to get along.
trying to raise a family, educate their children, it's the middle class.
I was sitting in here looking at this bill, we're gonna tax Social
security, that's gonna hurt seniors. I got to thinking, well they're
middle class too. Most seniors are middle class people, working class
people, people who have worked for a living all their lives. They might
get a little pension, but when you're 75 years old and you've only got
so much money coming, you can't absorb this stuff.
Probably the only thing that was mentioned earlier than us increasing
their taxes is property taxes. I've had seniors that I have tried to
help for nothing to appeal their tax revaluations because they had to
sell their house because they couldn't pay their taxes when it was
revalued. That's another piece of this bill that we're not paying
attention to. We're taking away mortgage interest deduction. For middle
America that's probably the number one thing that they have, and it
allows them - it helps a little bit to have a home and that home creates
most of the wealth that they have. For most middle America that's where
they accumulate what little they have to show for life after they're
done. They may get a pension if they have a good employer, but they can
pay for a house and live in it and own it. And then when we get into the
housing market, we're going up 300% on the tax...</p>

<p id="155:00">
…want to charge on mobile homes and modular homes, some of us 300, some
of us 100. What in the world are we thinking? Now, I don’t know where
you all come from if you have mobile homes. I’ve got them all over the
mountains up there.
All of a sudden, if you go buy a house you pay that little transfer tax,
it’s one or two percent, I can’t even remember what it is, but if you’re
down on the bottom end and you’re going to get a mobile home then you’re
going to pay five-and-a-half, I guess under this Bill, whatever the
going rate for sales tax is. You don’t even have to pay that much for a
car.
What is possibly in our thinking that we’re going to do this to people?
As I mentioned before, we’re going to put a burden on the churches and
the hospitals. Up until today, I thought we were doing it kind by
accident, that we were just saying, “Well, we’ve got to cut out some of
these deductions and we’ll just start here and I know it will be painful
but we’ll work it out.”
But now we’re finding out there’s some theory floating around here,
“They’re rich and we can go get them because they’ve got reserves, and
they can spend all their reserves.”  You get your hospitals in a fiscal
crisis, and that’s where we’re headed, make no mistake about it. When we
don’t expand Medicaid and they cut off all the money that’s going to
these hospitals to cover indigent patients, you’re going to have a
crisis out there.
Then we’re going to go after the nonprofit status that allows them to
raise money on their own. You’ve got to remember they raise a lot of
money on their own because they have charitable deductions and that kind
of stuff. We’re going to take that away, make them spend their reserves,
and then what?
Then what we’re doing, we’re estimating revenue in the out years, as I
understand it, at only inflation and growth in population. We’re saying
that we’re anticipating the revenue will increase only enough to cover
inflation and population growth.
But then we’re going to pass this Bill that’s going to require us to
take a billion dollars out of that, actually it’s more than a billion,
three, four and five years from now. Where’s that going to come from?
Everybody’s trying to say, “It won’t really come from anywhere because
we just won’t grow as fast.” No, when you’re estimating growth at
inflation and population that is zero growth already. You’re just simply
able to repeat what you were doing this year next year. When you build
in…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will Senator Nesbitt yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, you talked about mortgage deductions earlier. Do you
know how much under this plan, on the state level because I’m sure this
plan, like any does not compromise the Federal level where there’s
provision, do you know how much money is actually saved by a taxpayer on
$1,000?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, let me explain it to you this way. That’s not the way you need to
look at it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Let me tell you. It’s not going to be $100,000. It’s not going to be
$10,000. But whatever it is is very important to that little person on
the bottom. When you can take that as a deduction, it depends on your
income, our income rates are staggered now, it’ll be anywhere
from…What’s our lowest rate, five?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’ll be five.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To seven-and-a-half.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’ll be $50.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you just took $50 out of somebody’s pocket that owns a home that’s
earning $30,000 a year or $20,000 and trying to stay in that home.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, do you yield for a follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, I’m sure like yourself and I, we give money to
charities because, well, I think we do it because of the merit and the
mission of that charity. Wouldn’t you say, “Yes,” to that?

you want me to, I'll stay here and yield to all of you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I, you know, Mr. President, a follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You talked about churches earlier, and I'm sure, if you'll let me know,
I'll be ready for the sermon next time so that we know that we've got
it. But you talk about only $50 out of that money. Do you think having
the opportunity for a job would be more valuable than the $50 that may
come from that tax deduction?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, that argument is about as bad as the one that said if you
cut a penny on the sales tax it'll create a job. Neither one of 'em
creates a job. $50 doesn't create a job, nor does a penny on the sales
tax. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm just about through.  You know,
Senator Rucho got us on point. It's only $50 to somebody who only paid
$1000 in interest. We're down here thinkin' $50 ain't important. Well,
it's that deduction, it's another deduction, it's another deduction that
add up to a little bit of money for a family that ain't got anything.
They're workin' people that don't have enough to make it. And people end
up having to depend on, they have to get subsidized day care. We created
the CHIPS program so that people could insure their children that
couldn't afford to do it when they were workin' and makin' money, but
they couldn't afford $500 a month for a health insurance policy. These
things matter to people. And all of 'em aren't going to be like the
people that benefit from this bill. And what you're doing with this bill
is you're taking $50 from every one of those little ones to give 50% of
it to the top five percent in income in this state. And you're taking
it, in my opinion, from these small businesses -- now, Senator Brown,
you're almost gettin' big, because you own more than one dealership. I
think the Federal definition's 140 employees, so you better be careful,
'cause you're gonna become big business. But small business in this
state, that corporate tax cut? They're not gonna get it. Most of 'em are
not corporations. They're under some other entity, and as has been
pointed out to you, 90% of that tax break's gonna go to people outside
this state. And that's what we're tryin' to tell you. This bill misses
the mark. It's not helping the people we need to help, and the cuts, in
my opinion, will not bring jobs to this state. I don't think anybody has
found the formula to where they can bring more jobs to this state than
we're losing to outside the state. We are going to have to build our
economy with small business, creating jobs all over this state, in every
little nook and cranny of this state so that, hopefully, Senator
Apodaca, people can stay in the mountains and can stay in the east and
live there and have a job. We have some fantastic things, and out in
Franklin, we have the largest filer of income taxes on the internet. I
said, how in the world did he find Franklin? Well, he was an accountant
out there and he sent his son off to college and he had a brainstorm and
knew how to work computers. Next thing you know, they're huge. They had
to lay fiber optic cable through five counties to figure out how to do
it from there, but they do it. That's how you build North Carolina. Now,
I don't know how many people they employ...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to ask Senator Nesbitt if he'd yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, how long have you been in the legislature?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since 1979.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, do you yield for a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've been here for two and a half. When I arrived here, the unfunded
liability for retiree health care was almost $33 billion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, is this a ques-</p>

<p id="165:00">
It is a question. Thank you. We owed two and a half billion to the
federal government for unemployment compensation. We had seven billion
dollars’ worth of debt. We had robbed the highway trust fund about two
billion dollars over the last fifteen years. We were under water in the
consolidated judicial retirement system about forty million dollars.
Were underwater about forty million dollars for the National Guard
retirement system. Our employee healthcare was underwater and you've
been here for that long. Why should we listen to you about economics?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, for what it’s worth I didn’t expect you two to
start with and you’re afraid not to listen to me but for instance the
retirement system prior to this great depression we just had. When you
got here we were in a depression. We were about to lose this entire
country. Prior to that the retiree system was funded at 105%. That’s
what happened, we had a depression. Everything in this country went to
hell in a shoebox. Excuse me, I'm not sure that's proper Mr. President
but it’s just an old mountain phrase. It doesn’t really mean anything.
That’s what happened to this state and we're trying to build out of it.
It's not that the state was a failed state. By everybody’s definition we
are a great state and I hope you all still believe that. I do. But at
the end of the day we get down to where the benefit is to these large
corporations. It’s for the wealthiest among us. That’s where the tax
breaks are going and I thought I was going to add seniors and small
businesses to my list of who we were hurting but I realized they were
all the same people. it’s the middle class and the working people in
this state that are going to pay the piper and this is not tax reform it
is a tax shift where we’re just giving. The old bill we had was a tax
shift where you were actually taxing them with sales taxes to get it.
Now it's a tax cut for these wealthy that will be paid for out of
services like public education like the community colleges like Medicaid
for the seniors that will have to be cut as we move in these out years
in order to pay for this thing. This is not the way to go. It’s just as
backwards as the last one that we looked at and we would recommend that
you not send this forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] to speak a second time on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger has the floor to speak a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. There are several
things I think we can take away from the discussion today and actually
from discussions we've had over this session. One is there is some
things were just going to disagree about and we have a different view of
things we see the world in a different way. Some people think that the
health of government helps or insures the prosperity of the people and
others think that the prosperity of the people is derived from their own
initiative from the private sector from private business from individual
achievement. We're just gonna have to disagree about that. there are
several other things that apparently we're just gonna have to disagree
about and I think it's interesting in connection with this reform debate
or discussion that the initial bill that cam e out , the bill that
Senator Rucho had worked on and introduced. The bill that was based on
the traditional broaden the base lower the rates initiative was one that
the folks on the back row told us that we can’t support that because it
taxes food. We can’t support that because it taxes prescription
medicine. We can’t support that because it puts tax on services. So we
come up with a bill that doesn't tax food. It goes one better than that</p>

<p id="170:00">
And it takes the local tax on food off. Doesn’t tax prescriptions, and
doesn’t, impose tax on services.  Now, I know you’ll be astonished
because I was not astonished that there’s some folks that are still
opposed to it. Because sometimes it doesn’t matter what you propose,
there are for reasons that you see the world differently.  You’re just
going to see, have people that are going to disagree. I think there’s
one thing that we can all agree on and that is if you don’t have
employers, you’re not going to have employees.  And if you don’t make
your state attractive to employers, you’re not going to attract those
employers and you’re not going to have employees.  We all say we’re
interested in jobs.  We all say that we want to create jobs.  Now some
would say that the only jobs that count are the jobs that are  created
by government.  Well, we disagree.  The jobs that create prosperity in
our economy and in our state, our private sector jobs. This bill will
encourage private sector job growth.  Now, are there some entities in
the state that would be better off if we did nothing?  Yep, they would.
And there are.  They ‘re the ones that currently have a special set
aside, a special carve out, something that makes it better for them.
Let’s talk about the non-profits.  Under this bill, there’s a phase-out.
Well actually it’s a partial phase-out. Of the non-profit refund on the
sales tax.  When that is fully implemented, better than 97%, 97% of the
non-profits in this state will still get their full refund.  So who are
those 2.5% of non-profits that  won’t get the refund?  For most part,
they are business enterprises that are organized as non-profits.
Business enterprises that pay their executives millions of dollars a
year. Business enterprises that have reserves of millions of dollars.
Business enterprises that still don’t  pay property tax. Business
enterprises that still or currently don’t pay income tax.  Business
enterprises that are receiving a tax break at the expense of everybody
else.  Now, are they upset because we’re doing this?  Yes, I’m sure they
are.  As we’ve all said, I’m fine if you cut my taxes but if you raise
my taxes I got a problem with that. Well that’s where they are.  Let’s
look at this question of social security. Because we asked the AARP to
give us some scenarios where they were concerned.  And I will tell you
that they gave us ten different scenarios.  In each instance, in each
instance, the taxpayer either paid less or still paid zero in North
Carolina income tax. Let’s take the example of a single individual with
33,000 dollars in total income. 18,000 dollars of that is social
security, 15,000 is pension.  I’d say that’s not uncommon in North
Carolina for retirees.  That person will end up paying less in state
income tax under this plan. And that person will pay even less because
of the repeal of the food tax at the local level.  Let’s take that same,
let’s take a married couple filing jointly with 47,000 dollars of
income.  32,000 dollars in social security income and 15,000 dollars in
pension income. Again, for a retired couple, that pretty ordinary I
would say. That couple will pay zero North Carolina income tax.
Currently, under the current code.</p>

$120 in North Carolina income tax. Senator Nesbitt’s right. $120 is a
lot of money for some people. $50 is a lot, $120 is better than twice
that. Those people, somebody like that will get a cut under this plan.
And again, that’s not counting the reduction in the food tax
elimination. They’ll save even more for that. Now, we can come up with
an example of somebody that’s going to pay more. It won’t take long, be
creative enough. But most people at all levels of income will pay less.
Most people will pay less. And we’ll make North Carolina more attractive
to those businesses that we want to attract. We’ll make it possible to
create what really is the best cure for the social ills that we have.
And that is more jobs for our people. And that’s what we want to do. You
know, if you like where we are, vote no. But if you want to make some
changes, positive changes, move North Carolina forward, I urge you to
vote for the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of
the Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 998 on its second reading.

abiding, God-fearing, upright citizens who are permitted to carry
concealed weapons can be trusted where alcohol is concerned, presumably
because they are good citizens. An investigative report revealed that
900 concealed carry weapon permit holders were being convicted of a DUI,
a DWI, over a five-year period. Alcohol and guns do not mix. Thank you.

Speaker: The clerk will read.
Clerk: Senator Bryan moves to amend the bill.
Speaker: Senator Bryan is recognized to explain the amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President and members. In section 12 of
this bill of the concealed permit information application information is
no longer a public record and is made confidential, which I support.
What is important, I think, is to provide some level of information
about the activity this permit process. This amendment provides that
without revealing any personal, identifying information the statistical
reports can be made available for permits applied for permits granted by
county and zipcode and permits denied are revoked by county. This is a
minimal amount of information. It’s easily provided in the database of
records, which I have reviewed, that are kept based on the application
process by the sheriff and SBCI can be easily provided. It also provides
that costs will be paid for providing that information. I think that
some level of public information will be healthy from this process
without revealing any kind of confidential information on the permit
holders. I would request your positive consideration of this. Thank you.
Speaker: Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak to the amendment.
Speaker: Senator has the floor to speak to the amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, colleagues, thank you Senator
Bryan. I appreciate your effort to work on this. Senator Bryan and I had
a conversation about this, and I have looked at the language. In all
honesty, I think the language we have in the current bill is perfectly
appropriate for what we have before us. I would also, with respect to
Senator Bryan, ask her if we passed this amendment, would it encourage
her to vote for the bill? She stated she still will not support the
bill. I prefer to leave it like it is. So I would ask you to vote
against the amendment.
Speaker: Is there any further discussion or debate?
Representative: To speak a second time on the amendment.
Speaker: Senator Bryan you have the floor to speak a second time on the
amendment.
Representative: I just wanted to make it clear that I do support the
confidentiality of the permit information and worked on that bill in my
committee and would have voted for that. It is just a lot of other stuff
in this omnivous bill that it will be difficult for me to vote for. I
just wanted to clarify that.
Speaker: Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the senate is the passage of amendment 4. All in favor…
excuse me senators, before we vote here we have excused absences for
Senators Jenkins and Barringer. So the question before the senate is the
passage of amendment 4. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will
record the vote: 14 having voted in the affirmative and 31 in the
negative, amendment 4 fails. The bill as amended is back before the
body. Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the senate is the passage of house committee substitute
to house bill 937 as amended, on its third reading. All in favor will
vote aye, all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting and the clerk will record the vote: 31 having voted in the
affirmative and 14 in the negative, house committee substitute to house
bill 937 as amended passes its third reading. The amendments will be
[xx] and sent to house in concurrence in the senate committee
substitute. Senator Apodaka for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: Mr. President a motion please.
Speaker: Senator Apodaka to the floor with a motion.
Representative: Mr. President, I move that everything left on today’s
calendar be moved to Monday, June 17’s calendar.
Speaker: Without objection, so ordered. The chair is happy to extend
courtesies of the floor – house will come to order, the chair is happy
to extend courtesies of the floor to former Senator Formshaper of
County. Senator we thank you for being here with us today. Thank you for
your service.

Speaker: Senator Lanford for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To send forth a committee report out of order.
