…take your seats and visitors retire to the gallery.
Good morning. The core being present the house committee on finance is
now in session. Where’s my list of sergeants at arms?
NEW SPEAKER: ?? Sergeant at arms list.
NEW SPEAKER: Yeah, we have sergeants at arms today.
All right, the committee will come to order. We have no pages to
introduce. Can I have a motion on the amendments…I mean the… Thank you,
Representative Moore. Representative Moore moves, seconded by
Representative Alexander, to approve the minutes of the last meeting.
All in favor say aye.
NEW SPEAKER: Aye.
NEW SPEAKER: Opposed.
All right, we have one bill today, the Energy Modernization Act, Senate
Bill 786. We’ll not be taking up amendments today—we’re not going to
have time—they’ll be run on the floor. We are going to be debating the
finance areas only: that will be Section 11, Part 6, which is Sections
19 and 20 and also Section 30. If there is time, I am going to accept
some public comment, but we will vote the bill at ten minutes to the
hour. Questions?
NEW SPEAKER: Mr. Chairman
NEW SPEAKER: Yes.
NEW SPEAKER: Mr. Chairman? Off to your right.
NEW SPEAKER: Thank you. Representative Martin?
MARTIN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Inquiry of the chair if I could. And this
is my fault—I was trying to engage Representative Moffitt in
conversation. Did the chair state that we would not be accepting
amendments today?
NEW SPEAKER: That is correct, sir, we will run them on the floor later.
NEW SPEAKER: And a follow-up question, Mr. Chair.
NEW SPEAKER: Yes, sir, the gentleman is recognized.
NEW SPEAKER: Is it accurate to say that this is the only stop in a House
Committee for this bill?
NEW SPEAKER: That is not accurate. It was in the Public Utilities
Committee last night where there was considerable and vigorous debate,
but primarily on issues other than the finance issues.
NEW SPEAKER: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
NEW SPEAKER: And also I would expect the Speaker will allow a lot of
debate later today.
NEW SPEAKER: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
NEW SPEAKER: You’re welcome, sir. Further questions? Senator, would you
like to present the bill?
NEW SPEAKER: Thank you.
NEW SPEAKER: I apologize.
NEW SPEAKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the Committee, thank
you for allowing me to come today to present to you a limited amount of
finance-oriented Senate Bill 786, the modern… Energy Modernization Act.
Some of you have heard my speeches before—Representative Collins forgive
me for being a broken record—but when you’re dealing with a subject like
this it doesn’t hurt to repeat things.
North Carolina has been at this process, despite what some folks in the
media would like us to believe, for quite a while. Depending on how you
want to count it, at least four years. Some of you may recall Governor
Perdue making a trip to Pennsylvania and coming back with the conclusion
that North Carolina could do this safely, and it was worth exploring and
investigating to see if we could. And in 2011 we had a significant piece
of legislation which began the process by creating the Mining and Energy
Commission and directing them to take about a two-year process to come
up with rules for a modern energy regulatory system. Really a
state-of-the-art, where we get to take the things that have been learned
in all of the many other states that have been doing this for years and
make them work for North Carolina. So after this long and deliberate and
steady progress we have found ourselves here today where the Mining and
Energy Commission has already promulgated a hundred and twenty rules for
a modern regulatory system and this bill, after a lot of work with
Representative Hager, Representative Stone, Representative Boles and a
number of others—it’s been great working with these folks, a lot of
cooperation, a lot of give and take—and we’ve come forward today with a
very comprehensive and responsible piece of legislation. North Carolina
needs the jobs, and America needs the energy. And I would much rather
buy the energy from my friends down in Lee County than from some other
country. I’d rather make—</p>

<p id="05:00">
... millionaires down there then billionaires in Saudi Arabia. And I
hope people would appreciate that. But dealing with the finance part,
I'm gonna let staff explain it in just a moment but we've come up with a
very comprehensive and very attractive and competitive severance
package, and we've come up with good fees as it relates to well pads and
costs of well pads, and I stand ready to answer of your questions. Thank
you.
If I could have staff... Our staff today, Heather Fernell, Jennifer
McGuinness, and Greg Rhoney, Heather, are you going to explain this? OK,
thank you, Ms. Fernell is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm going to go over just the portions of the bill
that relate to the finance committee, and we're going to start on page
thirteen of the bill. Section 11 is a fee; and this is reducing the fee
for an application to drill. The fee was $3,000 for each well drilled.
What this does is set the fee at $3,000 for the first well on a pad, and
charge the fee of $1,500 for each additional well on the same pad. The
next sections are the severance tax sections - and this is sections 17
through 19 of the bill, and it starts on page twenty. There are
currently severance tax statutes on the books, however they were adopted
in 1945, and they're not really in effect - we're not currently
collecting any revenues under those statutes, so these sections repeal
those statutes and come up with a new way of imposing a severance tax on
the severance of energy minerals. It's probably easiest for you to
follow along if you turn to page six of the summary. There's a rate
chart that shows you the rate that will be imposed on the severance of
energy minerals. If you look at the chart, you'll see for oil and
condensates, the rate starts in 2015 at 2% and goes up to 5% in 2023, or
excuse me, 2021 and thereafter. For marginal gas the rate starts at 0.4%
in 2015. Marginal gas is gas that's produced by a well that is incapable
of producing more than 100 MCF per day. MCF is the measure of the gas,
and the Mining and Energy Commission or its successor will make that
determination whether the gas is incapable of producing that much, so
this is a well that is producing very little gas. So these wells will
have a lower rate than the other wells, as you can see it starts at 0.4%
and goes up to 0.8% for 2021 and thereafter. So for all other gas wells,
starting in 2015, the rate is 0.9%, and then as you see, starting in
2019, there becomes a graduated rate for the severance of gas. This is
similar to the graduated income tax. So for the deliver-to-market price
paid per MCF of gas, for the first $0 to $3 in 2019 is 0.9%, the next $3
to $4 is 1.9%, and then anything $4 and over paid for the gas is 2.9% of
the rate. As you can see, the stairsteps go up to 2023 and thereafter to
a high rate of 9%, for 2023 and thereafter. So the tax base, what these
rates are applied to, differs on the type of mineral. For oil and
condensate the tax base is the gross price paid, and this is the actual
price paid by the consumer; for gas the tax base is actually the
deliver-to-market price. And the reason for this is that when gas comes
out of the wellhead there are a lot of processes that need to happen
before it can be actually delivered to market, ready for consumption,
and put in the pipeline. Almost all states allow a deduction for these
costs to deliver it to market; this is really not an incentive or
deduction, this is really a tax fairness issue. We're trying to make
sure that we're taxing the same concept or the same unit - either the
wellhead price or the deliver-to-market price, so that is the base. For
gas, this is going to be administered similar to the sales tax, returns
will either be monthly or quarterly depending on the liability of the
producer. For those producers with much higher liability, they will be
required to file more often, and will probably be required to file
monthly. A bond or letter of credit is required if a producer fails to
file a return or pay a tax, and also any producer that fails to file a
return or pay the tax - their permit will be suspended under Chapter
113. The bill also provides that there will be no additional local
taxes, so no privilege taxes or any other impact fees or local taxes on
energy development. And finally, for property tax, there is a property
tax exemption for the presence of energy minerals, will be exempt from
tax where there is not a Permit to Drill been issued. So if you decide
not to drill on your land, the value of the energy minerals on that land
will not be taxed for property tax purposes. I'm going to now turn to
the last page of the bill, and this is Section 30, and what this does is
this is a change to the motor fuels tax. The motor fuels tax is
variable, it's currently 37.5 cents, that's on gas and diesel; for
alternative fuels the Department of Revenue, through the Secretary, can
either set an alternative rate or alternative unit of measure...</p>

<p id="10:00">
And this creates the alternative unit of measure for both liquefied
natural gas and compressed natural gas. For compressed natural gas, the
alternative measure will be the gas gallon equivalent of 5.66 pounds and
for liquefied natural gas, it will be the diesel gallon equivalent of
6.06 pounds. And so chairman that is all the tax and pay provisions of
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Fennell. Are there questions for the bill sponsor or for
staff?
Alright, Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman...I guess, well this is a question for staff: What kind of
fiscal note do we have on this in terms of how much revenue would come
in, we expect to bring in, well for any of the four categories, the four
columns?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Fennell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is a fiscal note on the bill, and Patrick McHugh, one of our
fiscal analysts is here and he can go through the fiscal note as
required.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. McHugh, are you present?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, do we have that to look at?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The fiscal note is in your packet; it's towards the end. It should be on
every members' desk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's part of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's part of the packet given to the entire committee. The bill is on
front, then the summary, and then the fiscal note in the back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, the fiscal note, Legislative Incarceration Fiscal Note, is that
the way it's labeled?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's the very rear. There's one before that, the Fiscal Memorandum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starr, are you complete? Representative Luebke, if you'd
like, I'll come back to you after you've had the chance to review. If
you'd go ahead and explain the fiscal note, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Patrick McHugh, fiscal research. Due to uncertainty about precisely
when exploration or extraction would actually take place, it's not
possible right now to estimate the timing of or level of any fiscal
impacts generated through these seven taxes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just reading the fiscal impact, we're bringing in just a hundred and
nine thousand dollars in 2004 to '14-'15 and just a hundred and fourteen
thousand in 2018-'19? Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, that's actually a possible expenditure. That is
for the attorney position in one of the bills I didn't go over. Section
29 of the bill allows the energy policy council to use a ?? attorney if
they would like instead of an A.G. attorney. It doesn't create a new
position, so it's not sure that this money would be expended; however,
if they did hire a position, that is the amount of money that would be
expended to hire an additional attorney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if I understand what you're saying is, this is the worst case cost
for administering the severance tax and we don't know what the revenue
is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is actually for just the attorney position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for the attorney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It actually doesn't have any administrative cost for the severance
taxes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rawley, you and I are on the same page, which is how much revenue...I'm
trying to be on a page, that shows how much revenue is estimated by our
fiscal staff to be brought in per fiscal year based on this severance
tax? How much money are we talking about in terms of bringing in
revenue? How much revenue is coming in? And if I can be shown what page
that's on and also how much it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, want to comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I'm still getting the page number up right now, but I'll just
expand slightly more. Given the relatively unproven nature of the
reserves in terms of how much is down there, what economic level,
essentially what price point would make the reserves that may exist,
economically recoverable in North Carolina. And uncertainty surrounding
the price of natural gas on the national market, it is unclear when any
exploration would actually occur.</p>

<p id="15:00">
What level of productivity would be resulting from that exploration and
as such it’s hard to say what fiscal revenues would be realized if that
would happen and the timing that would be attended to that so it’s not
possible at this point, given those numbers of uncertainties, to say
whether any substantial exploration would happen in the next several
years and if it were to occur what level of product and therefore what
level of severance tax revenue would be generated as a result of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay, so in fact we have no idea how much revenue is
going to come in from this I think is what I’m hearing. If I may follow
up Mr. Chairman I would like to know two things. First of all, why does
the tax start so low at 2% and rise to 5% as opposed to being a fixed
rate?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The short answer Representative Luebke is that we want
to encourage operators to come here and explore and drill and begin
extracting the natural gas.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Senator. Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes, to follow up this would probably be for staff or
maybe for you Senator but probably for staff. Where does North Carolina
rank with this proposed tax? Are we on the high side, are we medium, are
we low? Or can you give us a number among the states that have the
severance tax as to where we are?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Fennell.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] This tax is on the lower side. I will note that when
this bill was introduced last year in the senate, when the severance tax
was originally discussed in the senate, we had a higher default rate in
the bill. There was a lower incentive rate in the bill. Other states
such as Texas and Arkansas have offered lower incentive rates at the
beginning of the energy exploration. When we looked at the bill we
realized every well that was drilled in North Carolina would qualify for
the incentive rate so we removed the higher default rate so this just
has the lower incentive rate and the incentive rate is similar to the
incentive rate offered to the incentive rate offered in other states but
it is lower than the default or average of the other states.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Could I ask a clarifying question? It seems to me what
you’ve said is if we set a higher rate but then had an incentive rate
for the type of well that would be drilled in North Carolina that we
would end up in same place that in other states which have more
accessible natural gas they charge a higher rate on the easier to drill
wells but on the type of wells that would be drilled in North Carolina
their rate how does their incentive rate for difficult natural gas
recovery compare to our rate in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] This rate is similar to the incentive rate in Arkansas
and Texas. I’m not sure of every state with incentive rates but this is
largely based on the rates in Arkansas so it’s very similar to the
incentive rates in Arkansas for the high cost wells or the deeper wells
that were more difficult to access.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Well just one more in this area. Senator why is our tax
on the lower side? Why wouldn’t it be with all of the questions that are
about this legislation, about this policy, why wouldn’t we want to have
a tax that brings us on the higher side? Bringing us in more revenue to
deal potentially with problems involving this issue. I’d like to see why
not on the higher side.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Representative
Luebke. As you know Representative Luebke North Carolina has not been in
the energy business and has not been known in the nation as an energy
producing state and so a lot of the companies that we want to come here
to operate to explore and develop these energy resources candidly have
not had North Carolina until recently on their list of possible states
to operate in. What we wanted to do, as you know higher taxes tend to
drive away business and tend to drive away investment and tend to drive
away jobs, and what we want to do is create jobs and we want to create
investment and so we thought it was prudent to come in at a more
competitive tax rate to make sure that the operators knew that we want
them to come in to North Carolina and we ant them to develop these
resources. It has nothing to do with..</p>

<p id="20:00">
With tax rates have nothing to do with the perceived fears that some
people have about this process that’s been going on for decades, it has
everything to do with creating jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. Before I recognize Representative Starnes,
we now have two pages. We have Ian Bruner from Orange County, his
sponsor is Representative Meyer and we have Lauren Lee from Mecklenburg
and she has the misfortunate of being sponsored by me. Representative
Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you and I guess I’ll ask this to staff but I’m
going to turn to page six of the bill summary where it has the chart on
the tax rate. My first question it looks like you have three categories
of oil and gas: one is oil and condensates, marginal gas, and gas. Now,
what will be produced from the wells that we’re anticipating in North
Carolina? Which one of these categories will that be?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Newton?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Representative Starnes. Candidly because
there has been no real exploration, nobody is sure exactly what kind of
gas would come up. There are good indicators that there are condensates
and that is a much more valuable commodity than regular gas or what’s
called dry gas in the industry and marginal gas as Ms. Fennel explained
earlier are just wells that don’t produce that much to begin with. So we
really don’t know and that’s why we needed the different rate structure
for the different forms of gas. I hope that answers your question,
certainly Ms. Fennel may be able to add to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes, please. On the last category where it just says
gas and you’ve got the different rates and it says based on delivery to
market price and then going back in the writing underneath under tax
base it says delivery to market value is the actual gross price paid
minus the cost incurred by the producer to get the gas through the mouth
of the well. I don’t understand the taxing formula, I’m not questioning
it, I’m just trying to understand it. A producer spends X number of
dollars to produce the gas but he gets to subtract his cost and then
it’s taxed on the gas minus his cost, is that the way that operates? I’d
like to hear from staff on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Fennel.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes Representative Starnes, it is not all of the cost
of the producer. It is actually the cost from the wellhead to the
pipeline so this is not the cost of drilling and all of those costs.
This is basically when you pull it out of the wellhead you can either
sell it at the wellhead price or sell it when you deliver it to market
so between getting it at the wellhead and delivering it to the market,
there are several costs and they’re outlined in the bill like sweetening
the gas, compressing the gas, and preparing the gas for market and those
are the costs that are deducted. Most states that have a value priced
rate like this instead of charging per volume allow the deduction of
marketing cost, if not all marketing cost at least some marketing cost,
and it’s really not seen as an incentive, it’s more of a tax fairness
issue. You want to make sure that you’re actually imposing the tax on
the same thing. If you’re charging it at the wellhead or at the actual
pipeline, you want to make sure that you’re trying to tax the same price
instead of taxing gross price.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] One last question then.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] So if I understand this chart correctly on that part,
that’s not necessarily based on the introductory price, that’s just
basically a tax that would be consistent with what other states are
doing? Or is that an introductory price as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Fennel.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The base is not introductory. The base will always be
the deliver to market base what the rate is charged on and that is
consistent with all states who have a value tax. There are states that
tax the value so it’s like a percentage so it’s like a rate like this.
There are a few states that have a price for MCF so they’ll charge you X
amount of dollars per MCF and they don’t generally have the same
mechanism because they don’t need to because it’s a price per volume,
but this tax base is in line with most states regarding the value tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up? Okay, Representative Hamilton.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I mean, it sounds to me the tax offering here
is intended to incentivize the industry so I'm wondering if we're using
a favorable tax structure to incentivize the industry if new industries
coming in to North Carolina will be eligible for the same kind of
favorable tax structure?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll take a stab at it. I'm not sure that this bill actually encompasses
that, Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I mean, with this bill comes reduced taxation on these industries,
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton, we'll certainly welcome your support in
reducing the tax burden for businesses in North Carolina but I think
maybe you're a little outside the scope of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Weren't we just discussing reduced taxes on the industry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct but, I'm sorry, I'm interpreting your question to say what, I
feel, would you restate your question then 'cause I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are we offering a more favorable tax rate to this industry in North
Carolina than we are currently offering to other industries in the state
of North Carolina? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, yeah, okay Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton I think understand your question. Actually this
bill raises the taxes above what the current tax structure is for oil
and gas extraction significantly but what we've done is we've created a
tax rate in these variables that is a competitive tax rate with other
states, when you compare to other states. So it's an offer to attract
industry, to make them interested in coming here to create the jobs but,
quite honestly, this piece of legislation technically raises the taxes
on oil and gas over what current law is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, but reducing it, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, come on, yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, I think I've got the answer to the question. I guess what I'm
trying to get to is you've got a tax structure in which they will be
given a reduction if they choose to do business in North Carolina under
the current-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no, actually, actually if we didn't pass this piece of legislation
the tax rate would be much higher than what we're proposing in this
legislation. Excuse me, would be much lower, I misstated. It would be
much lower under current law than what's in this bill. So actually this
bill is a tax increase. However, however it's setting the rate at a
competitive rate compared to what other states tax. Not the lowest, but
in the lower tier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I might add to the confusion of this discussion. What is the current
market value per MCF?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it's, it fluctuates but it's about $4.50 an MCF.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, so the current market value is $4.50 so that means anyone, the way
I'm reading this bill, anyone producing gas in North Carolina will be
paying 1.9%, not starting off at 0.9, but they will be paying whatever
that going rate is. In effect it's a graduated rate, just like our gas
tax at the pump.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Finnell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the first three years it is a, it is a flat set tax. So for the
first three years it's .9% regardless of the price paid. You are correct
starting in 2019. So if an individual pays $4.00 per MCF in 2019 they
would pay 2.9% in 2021 they would pay 2.9%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, what's the earliest we expect anyone to actually start producing?

We're hoping for the latter part of 2015.

Most of the work goes into the first well of a pad, so we couldn’t

the first well and then only fifteen hundred on any remaining wells.
That would also be an incentive to put more wells per pad so there’s
less disruption of the surface. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you just… since a
lot of this Heather said we’ve based on Arkansas and Texas, could you
please tell me what those two states are charging? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I actually don’t know the well ??. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Carney, if it’s allowed… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss
??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s been several years since I looked at the fees
among the states, but as I recall, three thousand was on the high end.
There may have been one or two states that approached that amount, but
the basic premise is that it’s rather an apples to oranges kind of
situation among the states. Some charge higher fees initially for the
permit to drill, some charge other fees for a permit application, so
it’s all over the place, but on a straight comparison for the initial
drilling fee, North Carolina was on the high-ish end. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a comment. If we’re potentially headed
into this new venture for North Carolina, that the verdict is still out
on whether it is a good thing for North Carolina or a potentially
harmful thing for North Carolina moving forward, so if we’re looking at
incentivizing this industry to come here, I’m not so sure with what
potential damage there could be for us going forward that we shouldn’t
be thinking about capturing at any moment we can. If this industry
really wants to be in this state, then you’ll pay to play here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister
President ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Representative Martin. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I’m wondering – and the bill
sponsor’s probably uniquely suited to address this question because it
relates to prosecutions. I am still trying to get my head around some of
the changes that have been made to the criminal provisions of this bill
since it started off. As I understand it, Senator Newton, it’s now the
punishment for someone who discloses the chemicals - [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin, that received a full debate in Public Utilities
last night, but to summarize it, it essentially copies proprietary
information protections and several other provisions of North Carolina
statutes. It is not the most severe punishment. There’s actually a
felony provision in some of the hazardous waste laws, but I would ask
that you take the debate of that issue to the floor, since that’s not
related to the actual finance portions of the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry to the Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m
trying to limit my questions specifically to the finance portions, and
I’m looking at the fiscal/incarceration note where it actually
specifically references cost to the state, and maybe that would be more
appropriate for an appropriations committee – I don’t know – so out of
respect to at least limit it - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well okay, I’ll allow
the question, Sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Sir. I’m trying to get
my head around exactly what the punishment is for someone who discloses
the chemicals that are being pumped into our water. Is it correct that
it’s now a misdemeanor and that will result in at least reduced cost to
the state? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mister Chairman. Thank you, Representative Martin. By amendment, it was
reduced to a misdemeanor. That would in fact reduce cost, however I must
correct something slightly that you said. It is not a criminal penalty
for disclosure; it’s a criminal penalty for unlawful and inappropriate
disclosure of trade secrets. Just for everybody’s understanding, the
basic chemical formulas are going to have to be disclosed to FracFocus
under the rules of the Mining and Energy Commission have promulgated. So
that’s basically the basic ingredients. If you take Coca Cola, the basic
ingredients. The trade secret, if anybody wants it to be a trade secret,
is what we might call the recipe. All of that information is going to be
available. First of all the state holds it through the Geologist’s
Office, and we have a whole regimen in this bill set up to have that
fully disclosed to first responders, healthcare professionals, if
there’s any kind of event where it’s needed. So that would be a lawful
disclosure, if a doctor had an emergency, thinking…</p>

<p id="35:00">
something came from some sort of exposure or something like that, they'd
be able to get that, okay? That would not be an unlawful disclosure. But
if the doctor, they won't get the recipe either. They'll just get the
basic chemicals, what they need to react to whatever the situation might
be. This is very similar to how we deal with other aspects like
hazardous waste and other hazardous substances that may exist throughout
the industry and the state. So I just want to make that point clear.
There's been a lot of misinformation about that. There's no criminal
penalty until there's an unlawful disclosure of a trade secret and, in
this case with this bill, that would be a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chair. Follow-up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a minute. Nurse McGinnis has a qualification to the Senator's
answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well you had just asked whether it would,
whether it was the recipe vs. ingredient. Anything that was included in
the trade secret or confidential information. In an emergency situation
a healthcare provider or first responder could immediately get that
trade secret information. So whatever is there they will be eligible to
receive in an emergency.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify my understanding, so the chemicals used are going to be
generally available and public but the actual recipe combination of the
chemicals will be available, the state will have custody of that
information. First responders, emergency management, environmental
management, health physicians, even fire chiefs dealing with exigent
circumstances can get that information. So everything will be available
on a needed basis and so the information will be out there and even
anyone in the public will know what the chemicals are just not
necessarily the proportions, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's my understanding from the Mining and Energy Commission's rules,
that the chemicals, the cast numbers and that kind of thing will be on
FRAC focus for public information and things that are, the recipes as
commonly used, that are eligible for trade secret status, and there will
be a determination whether they are eligible for trade secret status,
those will be maintained by the department, Public Safety, and the
Mining and Energy commission and then in an emergency will be given to
first responders and medical personnel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, thank you. Follow-up, Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think so, Mr. Chair, and I just want to clarify, so is that, and this
is for the bill sponsor, the chair, or staff, whoever, Mr. Chair, you
think best equipped to answer it. So every chemical that's in there will
be publicly disclosed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin, I would defer to actually sending you the rule
from the Mining and Energy commission. They have a proposed rule and I'm
just simplifying it here, but my understanding is is that the general
chemical families are available through Frac Focus but as far as the
combinations, anything that is proprietary and trade secret, that would
not be public information. But I will be happy to send you MEC's
proposed rule so that I don't simplify it in a way that does not do,
because it is a comprehensive rule.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and whenever, no questions but would like to
debate the bill when you deem appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No question but would like to debate the bill when you deem  the
appropriate time for debate on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well we are in debate now. If you'd like to debate, your recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I thank you. These are the kind of questions that a full and
open process can actually allow us to answer and I regret that we're not
getting that, at all, that this is rushed. In my experience here nothing
good has ever come out of such a rushed process and it's only done when
we're trying to hide something. It's exactly what happened with the
lottery. People were embarrassed about what their pushing and I think
that's the same thing here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin, you're not debating the finance aspects of the
bill, you're wanting to debate the bill as a whole.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it's fair to say that just the finance aspect of this bill, Mr.
Chair, are highly complicated and-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin, I would say it's fair to state that you're
misstating what's happening in this committee today and what's in this
bill and of, we're about out of time we're to accept the public comment.
If you'd like to continue I'll let you use the four minutes remaining.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd welcome the opportunity to have the public comment. We've got the
time to do that and have another meeting on this. You did say, at least,
I'll take some tiny consolation that there will be a full debate on this
on the floor. Maybe mis-characterizing what you said and so if
Representative Moore decides to call the</p>

... questioning cutoff amendments, I think that will put the lie to that
idea, so I hope that won’t happen and I’ll stop there. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate by the committee? Elizabeth Ouzts,
you got three minutes. Miss Ouzts, would you please state your name and
organization for the record? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My name is Elizabeth Ouzts and I’m the State Director for Environment
North Carolina. We’re a statewide citizen-funded advocacy organization
and I urge you to vote against this bill. It breaks the promise, it
fast-tracks fracking and it fails to protect our waters. Fracking has
contaminated water and threatened public health and safety around the
country, and here in North Carolina it would threaten the Dan River to
Falls Lake to the Cape Fear River, and the drinking water for as many as
two million North Carolinians. Unfortunately this bill would weaken
liability requirements for would-be drillers, it usurps local
governments, and it punts on the issue of whether a landowner could be
forced to allow fracking on his or her land, but worst of all, this bill
breaks the promise that this body made two years ago. After the changes
made in public utilities, this bill fast-tracks fracking even more
quickly than the version passed by the Senate. It lifts the moratorium
and could allow permits to be issued as soon as May 2015. It offers a
major exemption for the 120 rules being developed now by the Mining and
Energy Commission. These rules are far from complete, and as we’ve heard
today, they don’t address a number of fracking’s risks. As just one
example of their inadequacy, they would allow toxic fracking wastewater
to be stored in pits, and we saw from the coal ash spill that that
spells trouble for our rivers. Due to the complexity of these rules, the
fact that this would be a brand new industry in our state, and the
tremendous public interest in these rules, it is extraordinary and it’s
inappropriate to cut the legislative review period for these rules by
more than 12 months as section 2 of this bill before you does, and it is
even more irresponsible for the legislature to lift the moratorium
before those rules are complete. Thank you for your time, and again, I
urge you to vote against. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Ma’am.
Representative Hager is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I will move for a favorable on Senate bill 786.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The motion before the committee is
favorable report on Senate bill 786. We’re going to take a show of hands
on the vote to make sure the count is correct, so many as favor the
motion, please raise your hand and hold it until released. Thank you. So
many as opposed, please raise your hand. On a vote of 19 to 14, the bill
passes. The meeting is adjourned.</p>
