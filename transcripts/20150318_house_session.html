  The House will come to order. Members will take their seats, visitors
will retire from the chamber, the Sergeant-at-Arms will close the doors.
Members and visitors will please silence all electronic devices. The
prayer will be offered by Representative Jones. Members and visitors in
the gallery will please stand and remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you. If you will, let us pray. Our Father, our Creator, and our
God, we humbly approach your throne of grace on behalf of ourselves and
the people of North Carolina that we represent. As we do so, we will be
mindful to enter into your gates with thanksgiving, and into your courts
with praise. Your word says blessed is the nation whose god is the Lord.
From the beginning of our nation, you have indeed poured out blessings
upon us, by your mercy and your grace. But we confess that too often we
have dishonored you and scorned your word. The nation desires your
blessing, and often fails to acknowledge you as Lord and God. You are an
always-faithful God who says if my people who are called by my name will
humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked
ways, then I will hear from Heaven, and I will forgive their sin and
heal their land. We pray for every member of this body, and for all the
elected leaders of our state and nation. Help us to hate what is evil
and love what is good. We acknowledge that all righteous wisdom and true
authority comes from you. In the words of your beloved son, we pray for
thy will to be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Each one here offers
their prayer in their own way, me, including myself, in the name of the
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.
And to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, if you ask the house to come to order please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The house will come to order. The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker; this opportunity to begin with Winston Churchill
once said, “We make our buildings, and then our buildings make us.”
North Carolina was founded in 1789 and I’m sure you all know George
Remus first hand that it was 50 years after it’s founding that North
Carolina enacted its first Common School Law, it’s first public school
bill which actually opened it’s as Williamsburg Elementary School in
Rockingham County. Well, I don’t know that it opened the doors as
Williamsburg Elementary School in Rockingham County but it opened its
doors in Rockingham County. Now, 175 years ago this state has now had an
unbroken history of commitment to public education. We recognize public
education is a very backbone not only of ours commerce, not only of our
culture but ourselves, it is our history and it is our future. Since
1839, when our General Assembly enacted that Common School Law public
education has been the focal point of the state. Today, as we all know
nearly 60% of all of our public money collected goes to sport of
education. Educational opportunities are bound in the state and we are
committed to ensure that they keep on bounding so to speak. Today, with
over 2,500 public schools in North Carolina we serve a diverse
population of more than 1.5 million kids with over 95,000 teachers
dealing with every possible challenge that one could imagine and many of
us, most of us are parents we get a sampling of that everyday, well they
get a sampling of that times a hundred everyday. Our public school
teachers change diapers, council broken hearts, play ball and oh yeah
they teach if we will just out of their way. So on this particular day,
I rise to commend our public schools, our public school teachers and the
commitment of North Carolina to the finest education in the world
through our public schools, thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Stokes, Representative Holloway
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, excuse me! I’m sorry. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I raise to the first
stand and say that I’m very proud to be one of the legislators who
represents Rockingham County, apparently where it all got started with
our public schools it is definitely…

  ...subject that in my opinion is one of the most important we talk about
here in Ralleigh and everything that we do is tied back to public
education.  Everything.  And probably the most importantly, our jobs,
economic development goes back to our schools.  Goodness knows we&#39;ve
talked a lot about it here and if we had a nickel for every time public
schools was referenced, this body would never have a need for money
again.  We talk about it in campaigns, we talk about it on the floor,
but we talk about it because it&#39;s very important.  It&#39;s in the
fiber of our society and our being and we definitely need to continue to
support our public schools and is something I&#39;ve been proud to have
been a part of and have worked on for the last 10 years.  And I commend

[Speaker Change]  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I just want to join my
colleagues in thanking our education chair Representative Horn, and our
education guru, the teacher Representative Holoway.  I&#39;m just a
dentist so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m really qualified to stay with
him, but I&#39;ve had the honor and privilege of being the
representative in which Wentworth Elementary school is in my district,
in Rockingham county.  And as one who&#39;s spent a good deal of my life
in schools, I appreciate the impact that my teachers had upon me and
it&#39;s an honor to just be able to join with you gentlemen in
recognizing the first public school in Rockingham county and our
commitment to public education.

Representative Pendleton arise?
[Speaker Change] Mr. Speaker I arise for a point of personal privilege.

about 50,000 people.
[Speaker Change] Does the gentleman from ?? , Representative Cleveland,

  and requiring the health assessment transmittal form to be permanently
maintained in the child&#39;s official school board. The General of
North Carolina House enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the house. House Bill 13 would
simply require submission of a form, and let me show you what the form
is, the form is actually a one-pager but since we don&#39;t print front
and back here in Raleigh, it&#39;s that right there, that&#39;s the
form, require submission of a form indicating the completion of a recent
health assessment prior to the first admission of a child into public
schools. House Bill 13 would also require the health assessment
transmittal form be permanently maintained as part of the child&#39;s
official school record. The proposed committee substitute for House Bill
13 makes several conforming changes and provides that the health
assessment must be made no more than 12 months prior to the date the
child would have first been eligible for entry into the public schools.
Ladies and gentlemen, the concern here is on the health and well-being
of the children that attend our schools. You may or may not know that
prior to entering into kindergarten or Pre-K, a child must have a health
assessment done. Note the term must, it&#39;s the law. But let&#39;s
jump one or two years ahead, let&#39;s say you have a child that&#39;s
entering a North Carolina system for the first time in second grade or
third grade or fourth grade, or for that account twelfth grade, no
health assessment is required. This information was brought to me by a
constituent, I looked in to it and just pretty much determined that at
some point in time any child needs to have a health assessment done when
they are entering our system, at what ever grade level. That&#39;s the
nature of the bill in front of you. I understand there will be some
amendments to offer. I&#39;ll be willing to listen to some of them based
upon what the outcome are, I&#39;ve spoken to a couple members and have
agreed to hear their amendments and very possibly push them forward but
you will probably hear things about, or may not, about immunizations,
which has nothing to do with this health assessment. You will hear about
waiting periods for the time, let&#39;s say a parent brings their child
to school in the third grade and they do not have a health assessment,
it&#39;s their first time entering into the system for North Carolina
and they are transferring from a different state, then they have 30 days
to get that information that they had a physical in another state and
get it to a doctor to simply fill out this one page form and turn it in.
You&#39;re going to hear that 30 days isn&#39;t long enough. Well,
I&#39;m here to tell you that 30 days may very well be long enough
because it&#39;s the same 30 day period that you have to have your
immunization done. It&#39;s the same 30 day period that&#39;s required
to go into kindergarten for your original health assessment. So my
concern is of that child as well as the other children they will be
interacting with. There was a concern that it not leave a negative mark
if they go past the 30 days or are sent home. First, I&#39;ve been told
they&#39;re not going to be sent home during that 30 day period but if
it&#39;s the 31st day and they haven&#39;t gotten their paperwork in yet
they will be sent home and there will be an amendment offered, I
believe, that will say that that will not be a bad mark against that
child simply because the lack of due diligence by the parent, and I
think everyone would agree with that. With that, Mr. Speaker, I&#39;ll
subject myself to any questions that may be coming and look forward to a
good, swift passage of this so we can help the safety and welfare of all
North Carolina children in whatever grade level. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, to set forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will

Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page one, line four,
rewriting the lines to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Cumberland has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and this is the amendment that Representative
Torbett was talking about that he was kind enough to talk with us about
yesterday in committee and asked us to work on the language and I
believe consents on the language but let me explain the amendment.
It&#39;s got a couple parts but it&#39;s allt he same issue, and that
isonce a child, if the assessment is not done within the 30 days, a
concern by a number of us what that that child not be suspended or have
a suspension on their record or whatever we call it, that they be
allowed to make up

  <p id="030:00">
  the work when they come back and not have this used as a way to kick
them out of school, and Representative Torbett I think very much was
kind enough and agreed with that principle that we ought to fix that.
DPI was checked with and prior to 2010, with regard to assessments as it
related to kindergartners, there was a suspension. That rule was changed
to a more permissive unexcused absence, but to end any concern,
particularly since we&#39;re extending it K-12, this amendment simply
says a child can&#39;t be suspended for that and has to be allowed to
make up their work and that way it doesn&#39;t create a hardship on the
child because, perhaps, the parents didn&#39;t get the assessment in
time. That&#39;s really what that second paragraph and the last
paragraph, the section 4.5 does that in amending the makeup work statute
that we have independently. The third part on page two that you see is
really just a technical fix for the word forms as it relates to the bill
and, again, I know of no opposition to this and hope Representative
Torbett will accept the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did confer with Representative Glazier and am very amenable to this
amendment. I would support passage of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. For what purpose does the gentleman
from Ashe, Representative Jordan, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Cumberland yield to the gentleman from Ashe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Glazier, what does happen after the 30 days,
then, if that form is not turned in for 35, 40, 50, 60, 70 days?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I understand, their fairly limited but the policy that&#39;s in
effect at DPI, and Representative Torbett may be able to answer this
better than I, that child under the statute, and the policy would
certainly be out of school, wouldn&#39;t be marked as a suspension,
would be marked as an absence, and under this statutory change would
then be allowed, when they finally get their assessment done, be allowed
to make-up the work as best that we can create that capacity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? If not, the
question before the House is the adoption of amendment offered by
Representative Glazier to the bill. So many favoring adoption of the
amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open
the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 118
having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, the amendment
is adopted. Members, the amendment does change the title of the bill,
will have second reading today but we will not be able to take up third
reading. For what purpose does the lady from Mecklenburg, Representative
Cunningham, rise?

Representative Cunningham moves to amend the bill on page one, line 27
by rewriting the lines to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Torbett, I hope that you will think about the
amendment I have put forth. I&#39;ve received numerous emails from
social workers and some public school nurses who are concerned about the
30 day time frame for the student to have a physical exam done. They
believe that the immunization can be done within 30 days but they
don&#39;t believe that parents that are moving in from out of state can
establish a physician relationship in which to take the form to the
physician&#39;s office and have them to sign it. So I&#39;m asking for
your support on the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t say what it did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady continues to have the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would actually change it from 30 days to 60 days. They actually asked
for 90 days but the 60 days is a medium, so I would ask for your
support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask the author of the amendment one question about the amendment, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Mecklenburg yield to the gentleman from Gaston?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Does the amendment also change the 30 day period to 60 days
for that, but does it change it to 90 days for their principal&#39;s
reporting period?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, it only changes the time frame to sixty days, just to have the
exam done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to propound an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The only way I could accept the 60 day, at this current juncture, is
that the reporting period for the principal is

  <p id="035:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently 60, so if you timed it out at the same time,
it would give no additional time so the principal would essentially have
to report on the exact day the same-the 60th day. So if there&#39;s a
second part in there and I have staff back there that can assist you
with that to change that number to a 90, resubmit your, or submit that
with that modification and I would accept that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, I&#39;ve been informed by
staff that it does change it to the 60 calendar days, determination of
the 60 calendar days-90 days, I&#39;m sorry. Yes, within the 60, within
the 90 calendar days after the commencement of a new school year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to ask any additional question
or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think this might be the last question Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady from Mecklenburg yield to the gentleman
from Gaston for a third question? She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just for my clarity, you&#39;re changing the initial
30 to 60 and then the reporting period from whatever it is to 90, is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, I&#39;d be amenable to that as well, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If not, the question before the House is the adoption
of Amendment 2 sent forth by Representative Cunningham. So many favoring
adoption of the amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. 113 having voted in the affirmative and 4 in the negative, the
amendment is adopted. For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Luebke rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the House, this bill was thoroughly
discussed in House Education yesterday as Representative Torbett has
indicated, and as the amendments indicate. I had asked in the committee
if we could be told how many schoolkids are actually affected by this
law currently. The current affect on kindergarteners, and the staff
reported just a few minutes, a little while ago, that the number is 4%.
So 4% of the schoolkids in our system across the state are not able to
meet the 30 day requirement, and do not have it at the time that they
enter. How many actually are able to finish getting the health
assessment in 30 days, we do not know, and I have asked staff to look at
that further, but we can know for sure that 4% of the kids in our school
system, trying to start out cannot start out without, with the health
assessment complete. They will be able to try to get that, but we
don&#39;t know how many actually won&#39;t get it and therefore will be
prohibited from staying in school. I think it&#39;s important that we
actually know how many it is and I will try to have that for you
tomorrow. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Orange,
Representative Meyer rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I&#39;d like to withdraw my amendment and
then debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, the gentleman&#39;s amendment is not before the
House, the gentleman may retrieve his amendment. The gentleman is also
recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I appreciate Representative
Torbett&#39;s support for Representative Cunningham&#39;s amendment.
This, that does make this bill more palatable to me. I do have a couple
of concerns that I want to express about the bill. My primary concern is
that simply extending this requirement for the physical places a
hardship on specific groups of people. We know that the young people who
are least likely to have access to physicals are low-income youth and
are immigrant youth. Right now when you&#39;re in school, in middle
school or high school, if you want to participate in an athletic
activity, you have to have a physical to be on an athletic team. And in
16 years of running a mentoring program for kids in schools, I can&#39;t
tell you how many times I&#39;d have a kid who wanted to play on a
soccer team or the basketball team or the volleyball team and they knew
they would have to get a physical and they&#39;d go to their parents and
say &quot;Can I get a physical?&quot; And their mom would say, &quot;I
can&#39;t afford the physical.&quot; And so they wouldn&#39;t be able to
play on the team because their family couldn&#39;t get them the physical
to be able to be eligible to play. And that&#39;s just missing a team.
My concern is that missing this physical doesn&#39;t take you off the
team. It takes you out of school, and that just really worries me about
how many of those kids are going to have to miss days of school because
they don&#39;t have the physical. And even if they get the physical, all
the form says is that they&#39;ve got a physical. It doesn&#39;t
actually tell us that they&#39;re healthy. It doesn&#39;t actually tell
us anything that&#39;s useful for helping educate them in school. They
could get a physical that says they&#39;re horribly sick, but as long as
they got the physical, they&#39;re still pretty likely to walk into
school. I also am concerned about a couple of, maybe untinten-

The consequences of this bill, for those kids who are most likely to
need public assistance to get the physical done they are gonna go to
their county health centers, those health centers in all of our primary
care providers are already overburdened and worry about this increase in
the burden on them. I think in my county increasing the burden on the
county health centers is gonna increase the burden on ?? taxes so we are
pushing the expense for these physical as down to the county tax payers.
And then finally, I just come to one thing that I have said before in
this floor and I think about it occasionally here nothing has made me a
bigger fan of limited government and being in the North Carolina House
of Representatives. There is not a problem that brought this bill before
us we didn’t have any public health outbreak, it’s a solution and search
of a problem, we don’t need another Governor regulation that tells
families when they should see a doctor or how to get into school, we
don’t need another piece of paper when our kids…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guildford, Representative ??
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the gentleman will yell for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Orange yell to the gentleman from Guildford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yell when I’m finished, I’m almost done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman does not yell to this time, the gentleman from Orange
continues to have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would simply say that if you like additional Governor regulation, if
you like pushing down cost of healthcare to County taxpayers, if you
like making a more difficult for poor kids, immigrant kids to be out of
school then this is a pretty good bill, I don’t believe this is a bill
that makes our schools significantly healthier in anyway and for those
reasons I think it’s just not a good use of state resources and I’m
going to oppose the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guildford raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the gentleman will yell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Orange yell to the gentleman from Guildford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you a lot of what you said in opposition to this bill would also
mean in effect that you are opposed to the underlying requirement that’s
already in the law for the same health assessment, are you of the
opinion that the long requirement that’s been in the law for a long time
should be repealed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there are some very good reasons why we should try and make sure
that kids are getting physicals. And if this bill was attached to say a
plan for us to have nurse practitioners in schools and making sure that
kids were getting physical as we could attend their learning needs that
were created by physical conditions or we were talking to lessons about
the type of health decisions they get may during those years using a
physical to help us with those things that would help kids perform
academically in school be fantastic. I think that the expectation that
having a physical requirement for kindergarten gives us the benefit of
making sure that family start making sure that they have regular
physicals early but I don’t know that it helps us that much with school.
So I will be open to the debate about, is that really a necessary
requirement for enrollment in kindergarten but that’s not part of this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Orange yell to the second question from the
gentleman from Guildford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanna zero and more, do you think that the current requirement that’s
already in the law which this bill is amending, do you think that should
be repealed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t believe that is at debate in this bill at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Scotland, Representative Pierce
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the Bill Sponsor a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is the gentleman wished to direct the question to the gentleman from
Gaston, does the gentleman from Gaston yell to the gentleman from
Scotland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe so Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative, just listen to the members speak, would that
be an extra resources public health departments, school boards, anything
to have with this, with school system, the point is about there are many
children who for different reasons parents might not have the funds to
get the assess I mean is there any consideration given to that if you
don’t mind me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, it’s my understanding that different schools happens
various ?? to help that child meet the necessary requirements just like
they do in the existing program in the kindergarten process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or further debate on the bill, for what purpose does
the gentleman from Gaston, Representative…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker to speak second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a gentleman that was talking about the needs and conditions and
concerns about the child entering the school and perhaps I don’t think
he has ever seen one of the actual forms possibly because here it would
actually help with the understanding of…

  child&#39;s needs entering the system, such as what if the child had a
hearing disorder that would be discovered during a physical, then that
child would be able to learn more because once that disorder was
determine he could be fitted with, perhaps, a hearing aid so he could
learn properly in the classroom. Perhaps this physical as it&#39;s
checked off here on the back page might have a vision disorder, so
perhaps at that point in time that child could go get reading glasses so
he could actually what&#39;s put in front of him better and maybe for
the first time see the world as it truly was created. But, without the
physical, perhaps that would not occur other than at kindergarten. What
if it was determined a child had, God forbid, Tuberculosis, for example,
and it wasn&#39;t determined. So you say you&#39;re after the health of
the child, you can&#39;t be if you don&#39;t support this, as well as
the other children that sit in a classroom that would be having day to
day interactions with this. Sir, I deeply hope you consider voting yes
on this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I&#39;m pleased to bring before you a very
simple bill. This bill came out of our education innovation house study
committee and it was changed in a PCS to take away the appropriation,
but otherwise it was vetted in our study committee and I thank my
cosponsor, Representative Horn, who carried it in Education, it had
unanimous support. So the net of it is that many of us have successful
cooperative and innovate high schools in our districts, more than half
of the LEA&#39;s have them, and this is where we have an early college
program where our high school&#39;s partner with our community college
or university system. Right now we have one issue on the way that
they&#39;re approved and this has come to bear, this actually is an
issue that came out of my district where Wilson has been approved for a
cooperative and innovative high school on contingent on the budget. So
they were approved in April but they have to wait for funding to come in
our final budget, which unfortunately does not always come out as
quickly as we would all like it to come out in July. In this case, they
are doing a lot of technological components and this will be the second
early college and they don&#39;t feel comfortable starting this year and
our current program is that once they&#39;re approved they have to start
that calendar year. So all that this does is allow that once they are
approved that they would have the option to have a planning year and
then open the following year. This is not unusual for charter schools,
if more is required and they&#39;re not ready to get started they can
have a planning years. We took the funding out because that would be
specific to an individual school and their requirements and we may look
at something in appropriations but we don&#39;t want that to be required
for us to be able to pass this so they know that they can continue with
their planning and have a planning year and open the following year. So
I would truly appreciate your support and happy to answer any questions.

Carney, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I am back before you,
two years ago I want to thank members in this House. We passed House
Bill 127 98-19 and sent it to the Senate and it got lost over there. So
I decided to file another bill, and I want to thank the primary sponsors
again, Representative Johnson, Elmore and Glazier. The bill is exactly
what it said as it was read in, as read in the title. It&#39;s an act to
direct the State Board of Education to require one arts education credit
prior to graduation from high school, and to report back to the Joint Ed
Oversight 12 15 18. This bill is a bill of flexibility. It&#39;s a bill
that gives the State Board the ability and the directive to design this
credit and this requirement and the implementation of it. I think it has
given them a lot of flexibility. What this bill is not, it is not a
burden on our schools. What it does is it allows the State Board to
determine what the criteria will be for the requirement. There are many
options that it will consider, so that you can go back and tell people
in your local districts. They may decide to look at a high school
elective that&#39;s already being offered, to let that be used towards
the requirement. It might be a middle school arts ed course that&#39;s
already being taught. It could be an arts appreciation class that&#39;s
offered online.

  Or it could be an arts course for credit that&#39;s offered after school
in the community. Both in and out of school experiences will be able to
be used by the State Board to help to develop the criteria again for
this requirement. What is happening now is that we have a lot of our
students and the data shows over a hundred percent of our students are
taking arts classes between six and twelfth grade. However, that
number&#39;s skewed because it comes from a lot of our students are
taking numerous arts courses. So what is not happening now is that all
of our students are not getting that opportunity for arts ed. So this
will ensure, this policy will ensure that all of our students will have
that opportunity for the exposure to the arts. Thank you Mr. Speaker and

Elmore, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak about the bill. [SPEAKER

CHANGES] As a teacher myself and a teacher of art, of course I would
feel that this bill is very important. But I try looking at the big
picture, not just how it would affect me or my students but how it would
affect their futures and what they&#39;re facing in life. As the economy
is changing, we are seeing that creative industries are very important
and that job skill sets are constantly changing. They&#39;re very
different than they were even ten years ago, much less twenty years ago.
The arts helped develop those types of job skills that the industries
are looking for. Just in the creative industry alone, there are
currently 1.9 million people working in creative industries right now.
And the, by 2016 the government is expecting to see an additional 1.3
million jobs just in creative industries. Many, many studies you can get
on the Internet, if you just look up benefits of art education,
it&#39;ll show you report after report of skills that are developed in
these classes that help these children. Like drama, for example, helps
you understand social relationships, complex issues, emotions. Music
improves math achievement, proficiency, reading, cognitive development.
They&#39;ve even found that it can boost SAT scores. Dance helps
creative thinking, originality, elaboration, flexibility, improves
expressive skills, even helps with the physical health. Visual arts
improves content and organization of writing, sophisticated reading
skills and interpretation of text. Those are the critical thinking
skills that the business people are constantly asking for, is that
thought process. So I think that this requirement is not too much to ask
for our kids in the public schools to have to do so we can prepare them
for the 21st century skills that they need. I ask for your support on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from
Burke, Representative Blackwell, arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have ?? respect for the
sponsors of this legislation and I realize that it&#39;s probably on a
fast track to the House, but I want to take just a couple moments to say
to the House that I believe this is a mistake. It&#39;s very tempting
when we come to Raleigh as legislators to think that we have an
opportunity to impose our will on the folks back home. But we have 115
elected school boards who already have the authority to require an art
credit in order graduate from those schools. This is basically saying,
“We&#39;re going to force you to do it, whether you want to do it or
not.” And if it involves the redirection or the spending of additional
resources in order for you all to come up with the art teachers that are
needed and the spaces that are needed for art classes, we&#39;re going
to force you to do that. We&#39;re going to give you another mandate. On
another occasion we&#39;ll talk to you about how we like to give you
flexibility. And on another occasion we&#39;ll talk to you about how we
don&#39;t want to dictate things from Raleigh. But on this occasion
we&#39;re going to direct the State Board of Education to come up with
more rules and ??

to require you to what you can do but what some of you have not chosen
to do. I don’t think that’s the way we ought to go in this particular
instance where they are fully capable of doing it. This is not about my
school district, my school district is one of the school districts in

it has nothing to do with how I, or how I think how the House ought to
feel about the quality of arts education or the appropriateness of an
arts education, or the value of it. It’s that we have school boards
elected and that’s their responsibility. We don’t need to make this
judgement for them. So I would urge you, as members of the House, to
vote against this bill - not because you are against arts education, and
maybe not because you don’t even think it’s a good idea for kids to take
art, or maybe for your local district to require it - but lets leave it
up to them.

[SPEAKER CHANGES - PITTMAN]
Thank you sir. This difference between opportunity and requirement. If
something is available, the opportunity is already there. It doesn’t
take making it a requirement to making it available. If there are art
electives, then the opportunity is already available. And forcing
someone to have to take an opportunity they don’t care to take - I don’t
consider it to be appropriate. I remember in grammar school we had art
teachers and music teachers coming around to our classes periodically
and some of it was ok and some of it bored me to tears and I couldn’t
till they went on and we got back to our regular business in class. I
think for people that have a desire and interest four art courses it is
great to have those available - and we should make them available - we
are already doing that. A requirement is something different. I
appreciate the Senate voting with me last time this came up, and I hope
they will do so again and I urge you to no. Thank you.

Does the lady from Mecklenburg yield to the gentleman from Gaston?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.

[SPEAKER CHANGES - HASTINGS]
Respectfully, would arts include music?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the lady yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield all questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, if for eight years my wife and I decided to have our daughter in
violin lessons, once a week, each month, for eight years, is there a
guarantee that you can give me that she would get - and these are
private lessons that we pay for - is there a guarantee that you can give
me today that she would get credit for that eight years, or nine, or ten
of violin lessons?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, may I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. That’s a good question, and that’s what this bill is all
about, and as I said earlier in presenting the board that this gives the
flexibility to the state board that they can use both those in and
out-of-school experiences to take into consideration when they are
designing the credit for the requirement. Yes.

Thank you. I wish I was a professional athlete, that right now I could
be in the NBA, because I’d be making good money. But as you can see from
my build, and my skill set, I’m not necessarily in the NBA. When you
were in high school, I want you do think about what you had to take. You
had to take physical education and there’s not one of us in here that
are a professional athlete. Yes, it is an opportunity. There are all
sorts of opportunities But this body has dictated that certain subjects
are important. Like English, science. My kids are in the fourth grade, I
have twin sons, they come home and “Daddy, I just can’t stand science…

arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I&#39;ll try to be brief, mister speaker, but after we had a vote on
this issue, I think it was in my second session, some people from around
the area where I live, they called and complained and said that I was
against the arts. And so what I explained to them was that no one could
guarantee me that my daughter&#39;s violin lessons would count as
credit, and so that&#39;s why I voted against the bill and I still
don&#39;t have that confirmation of a guarantee, so it&#39;s not that
I&#39;m against the arts. It&#39;s just that I would wanna make sure
that people who spend thousands of dollars privately for music lessons
would get credit, and so I&#39;m not against the arts, but that&#39;s
the reason I can&#39;t vote for the bill today, is because I don&#39;t
have that firm commitment that my daughter would get credit.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With all due respect to my good friend Representative Elmore whom I
deeply respect and admire, to me, comparing Phys Ed to art is comparing
apples and oranges. Athlete to an artist. To me, there&#39;s no
correlation there. I consider health and Phys Ed to be something
essential. It&#39;s teaching you how to take care of yourself, and I
think it&#39;s a much more important course that we&#39;re required to
take. Art, to me, should just be an elective. It is not essential. It
may be a wonderful thing. I think it is. More power to the people who
have talent and interest in that, but it&#39;s not an essential, and so
I simply don&#39;t see the need to add a requirement of something that
is not an essential course. Let those who have the interest and the
propensity take those courses, but don&#39;t force others who are not
interested to take them. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, mister speaker. I agree with the comments of my
colleagues, Representative Elmore and Representative Carney and the
eloquence of them. I want to speak to the art issue, but then I want to
speak to a little bit more to the, the logistics issue. But I think
something Representative Carney said maybe as her first statement got
lost in the shuffle, but this is the culmination of a long process that
involved educators, school boards, department of public instruction,
business community, and numerous stakeholders from all across North
Carolina that came up with these recommendations. And so it&#39;s not
simply predilections or views of particular, particular members. We all
know that the arts possess a unique ability to transcend all other forms
of communication, to transform fear to understanding, and prejudice to
tolerance, and anger to joy. And the arts provide us with a unique
ability to redefine our communities and leave for future generations a
really indelible footprint on our collective human experience. Arts
elevate and they motivate and they teach and it really causes us to
reflect and deepen our understanding of humanity, and create the better
part of our existence. And so with Representative Pittman&#39;s point,
and I certainly understand the PE and he&#39;s right, about the
necessity as a matter of health. I would argue, and Mike Huckabee who
was Governor of Arkansas at the time and became chairman of the national
governor&#39;s conference argued in his year as chairman, that he chose
arts and education as his primary topic. And he argued back then that
that was and that the arts are as important as PE or any other subject
to our collective experience and to our children&#39;s future.
Representative Elmore talked about the fact that the arts are now $166
billion economic endeavor in the United States, and in North Carolina
last year, 159,000 jobs

  And in the age of creativity it seems to me our communities are
competing internationally for the best and brightest to make their
communities home, and every bit of research establishes the communities
that offer arts, and arts opportunities to their children are winners in
that environment. I guess my last point would be to say that the arts
speaks to our history and our culture and our values as a people which
is what we want to teach our children. And sometimes as children, even
as parents, we don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know, and I will forever
be grateful to my school system that even though I had no inclination to
do printing and to do shop when I was a kid, I had to take a shop course
which taught me some skills that I never would have otherwise would have
had. And I also had to take an art course when I was a kid, and I was
and remain the worst artist who can only draw stick figures. But I did
come to appreciate what art represented, and I did come to understand
how important it was to a living, breathing democracy, and for that I
really commend the bill and I think this is a great opportunity, and I
think it can be done by school systems well and without any additional
cost. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Alexander arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have sat here with some growing amazement. I figured this bill would
not generate half of the discussion that we&#39;ve had. And it caused me
to journey back in my mind especially after the remarks of one of my
colleagues when he discussed what is essential. It made we wonder
whether or not we have wasted money out on Blue Ridge road when we put
millions of dollars into an art museum. It&#39;s made me go back and
think about my own education. I remember taking art classes in, like
another one of my colleagues, I couldn&#39;t draw worth a you know what,
but I enjoyed learning a little bit about sculpting. And it&#39;s, one
person&#39;s essential is somebody else&#39;s waste of time. And who,
who are we to determine which is which? Art is one of those things that
helps us to expand our minds, to expand our grasp on what it is to be
essentially human. I don&#39;t know whether it was done at the federal
level or the state level or at the local level, but a number of public
projects now spend 2 or 3% of their ?? project&#39;s costs on art. You
just have to go all around my home city and you&#39;ll see how spending
that money has brightened up some otherwise drab buildings, and
incidentally as you look around this chamber, what do you see hanging on
the walls? Do you see gym socks? Baseball bats? And this art has only
recently arrived, but it does brighten the chamber. I am really standing
to say folks that the intent of this bill is such that we ought to be
supporting it. We really ought to be supporting it. We really
shouldn&#39;t be spending our time nit picking this one to death, and
believe it or not, art is important. If art hadn&#39;t been important,
why would we have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to redecorate
the chamber that we are debating in right now?

To speak on the bill first.

The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a lot of people in my district that are artists, and I&#39;m a
picture framer, so I frame a lot of the pictures, from oil to
watercolor, whatever they do, but there&#39;s other aspects too.
You&#39;ve got clay artists that do pottery. You&#39;ve got basketry.
You have glass blowing. This is a job spill. This is something that we
really need to look at a whole lot. It affects a lot of lives, many,
many lives. Although you think you might don&#39;t want to take an art
class, once you get involved in it, you might really find that it&#39;s
of interest to you. I would like to ask Representative Carney just one
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Mecklenburg yield to the lady from Yancey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, mister speaker. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you happen to know how many school districts do not have art classes
in their education curriculum?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I do not how many, I do not know how many. I do know that through
the statistics that were provided for us that not all of the schools are
offering, and there&#39;s, there&#39;s very limited of those that
aren&#39;t. I think that in some form, they may offer an outside artist
in the community to come in, but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re
offering. They&#39;re just very few. The problem is not every student
is, is getting that exposure. Thank you for the question.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Thank you Representative Carney. Just as a
clarifying question, and those who might not have been on the education
committee when these were passed out. Isn&#39;t it true that this
requirement begins in the sixth grade and goes to the twelfth grade and
has seven years in middle school and high school to complete this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Stokes, Representative Holloway
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. I want to thank Representative Elmore and
Representative Carney for bringing his bill to us and I do apologize to
them. Somehow it slipped past me, or I would have actually cosponsored
it. But this is something that I think is important, and I think the
kids need some exposure to art, and I don&#39;t see the harm in having
it be a requirement. We&#39;re taking about one course, and the child is
either going to go through this course, and it may be something that
could spark a career or maybe it might be something as simple as
teaching them a hobby or something that&#39;s relaxing, something that
they can maybe release the anxieties of their day to day life. This bill
has always created a stir. It&#39;s been around a long time, and
Representative Carney, I think I remember you even trying this ten years
ago when I first got here. One would think that they were perhaps
teaching detrimental stuff in, in these classes that we don&#39;t want
our kids to learn, but that&#39;s not the case and I don&#39;t see the
harm in doing this at all. And I think about in my life, and then
I&#39;ll sit down and hush, but about things that I was made to do that
I perhaps didn&#39;t want to do, and one that comes to mind I can think
about as a kid, on Sunday morning I didn&#39;t want to really get up and
go to church. I was like every kid that wanted to sleep in and stay in
bed, but with my parents it was not a choice. I had to go. And I&#39;m
thankful for that exposure because that was a life changing thing for me
later on, but same thing with art. Unless they have that exposure to it,
they might not have that life experience. You may not spark someone to
become an artist or to do something with that in their life. I think
this is a good bill. It&#39;s not gonna harm anything at all, and I
think we need to just move it on and send it to the Senate and hope for
the best that it may finally pass over there. Again thank you to the
bill sponsors for filing this.

this bill, and I want to explain to you why I&#39;m supporting this. In
high school, a student will have an opportunity as they go through their
four years of training, and in some situations, early college five, five
years of educational training. When a student has a chance to

  <p id="080:00">
  They can choose their coursework. That is called self determination. A
child is deciding what&#39;s of interest to them. And when a student
sees that he has an opportunity to choose things that motivate him or
her, to stimulate their learning, to create an interest in their
educational opportunities, and they have an opportunity to choose
something that&#39;s of interest to them, especially art, we should give
them the opportunity. The requirement is, I understand we&#39;re talking
about requirements. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that. We have
other requirements in high school. But when a child has an opportunity
to take a course such as art, we as adults are giving this opportunity
to that child to make that decision. And that child may decide that this
is something that they are interested in. It excites them. It creates an
experience in them that they thoroughly enjoy. And I believe it&#39;s an
opportunity to give a student a choice. A choice to graduate from high
school. And they may become an artist. But did you know all students in
North Carolina have to choose in their high school environment. They
have to choose a cluster. It could be computers. It could be physical
education. It could be math, it could be science. They have to choose a
cluster before graduation. Some students may decide, art is my cluster.
Art is the cluster I want to concentrate in before I graduate from high
school. So what we&#39;re doing here, I think, is creating an
opportunity for a child who otherwise would not get involved in art. But
we&#39;re also creating an opportunity to give that child learn a chance
to learn a subject area that may keep them in school. I don&#39;t have a
problem with this legislation. I actually think it&#39;s good to have
this as a part of the curriculum. I have known children in our public
schools who had behavior problems, who did not want to be in school. But
they could sit down at a desk and they could focus on art. They could
produce some wonderful artwork. And it&#39;s something that created a
desire for them to be in school. Art has a lot of advantage, whether
it&#39;s  required or it&#39;s an elective. I don&#39;t see any problem
with this being a requirement. Students have many selections in four
years, and I think it&#39;s an opportunity for us to encourage that
learning. I would encourage you to vote for this bill. Thank you.

in view of the hour. Members have asked questions about it. Haven&#39;t
heard opposition but there are questions they want to have resolved. To
no one will we delay right or justice. That&#39;s a problem we have. Our
criminal justice system disposes of crimes in sometimes short periods
but sometimes one year, three years, four years. There&#39;s not much
deterrence if a criminal is not sentenced for a long period of time. and
there&#39;s no justice for a innocent defendant who has to wait that
long to clear his or her name.

  But instead of signing a--having them sign a waiver, and dispose of a
guilty plea, the magistrate is forced to send the case to a district
court judge, to have the waiver signed or continue the case to a later
date. Unnecessary delay. Section 4. I&#39;m going to ask Representative
Jackson to explain that after I explain some others. There will be--I do
have a technical amendment to change the wording, I believe, of the
title of that section. Section 5 conforms our state law to a decision of
the U.S. Supreme Court in Hall vs. Florida. The reason we put this in
statute, whether you agree with it or not--and I don&#39;t particularly
agree with it--there&#39;s no point in having cases go forward under a
mistaken apprehension of the law that then has to be appealed and
retried and done all over again. So this is just doing what we have to
do. It&#39;s like eating spinach, which--I do actually like spinach now,
after decades of not. Section 6--as I&#39;ve gotten more comment about
Section 6 because it gives a judge a discretion in whether to put people
who are guilty of sexual battery on the registry, the 10- to 30-year
registry for sex offenders. Some people have called, wanting it to be,
become more liberal--I&#39;ll use that term. They want it to be
retroactive to their case. Others can&#39;t believe we&#39;re doing it
anyway, because we&#39;re being soft on crime. But you have to
understand, these are not the felonies of rape or second-degree rape, or
first-degree sexual offense, and I&#39;m not minimizing it, but this is
the misdemeanor of sexual battery, which is a &quot;touching,&quot; or
contact, of a sexual nature, but it&#39;s not always the predator that
you really want on the register that you want to stigmatize properly,
usually, for 30 years. And again, we asked the people involved in this,
in the Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Coalition Against
Sexual Assault, were in favor of this. I didn&#39;t think they would be,
but they would be, and we had no objection in our stakeholder meeting.
This will help get people to plead guilty to this when they are guilty
of it, because the main reason they don&#39;t plead guilty is they
don&#39;t want to be on that list for 30 years. Section 7 and 8 are
really just efficiency things of sending orders by electrons through the
cyberspace and  through fax rather than delivering hard copies just to
move the process along. Section 9 takes from &quot;shall&quot; to
&quot;may&quot; a requirement about doubling the bond in certain cases.
And we just passed that a couple years ago, and there have been
some--really, the magistrates have told us this has resulted in some
terribly high bails for things that just should not have terribly high
bails just because of the sequence in which the charges came through.
Matter of fact, we have a letter from one magistrate who says that
people have realized this so they&#39;ll now bring charges one day after
the other, so they can get their opponent, get their bonds doubled, and
require them to have secure bond for things that they would have very
small bonds otherwise. Again, this was a consensus idea that would
really help our judicial system. I&#39;m going to ask Representative
Glazier to explain Section 10. Section 11 adopts the federal rules on
evidence for business records, and this applies to civil as well as
criminal cases, and just allows more evidence to come in upon a piece of
paper rather than a live witness. And it was submitted to the bar
association, their civil lawyers, and they were fine with it. I&#39;m
going to ask Representative Glazier to explain Section 12, and
Representative Faircloth to explain Section 13 and 14, and ask
Representative Rena Turner, who sort of checked it all out from the
clerk side to just sort of bless it all and say it was good. And I see
she says it&#39;s good, is that right? So thank you, we&#39;ll be glad
to answer questions, but I would ask the Speaker if he would
represent--recognize Representatives Jackson, Glazier, and Faircloth.

  For a couple of other sections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does
the gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson, arise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the
floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, the part of the bill that I&#39;ve been asked to
explain has to do with remands. These are DWI cases. We found several
years ago was that smart defense attorneys who had a client who had
multiple offenses pending would give notice of appeal in one case, which
was treated as a first offender. And then while that case was on appeal
would come in and do the second case, and that was treated as a first
offense. And then they would withdraw the appeal. So the General
Assembly said, we need to stop that. And we did that. This body acted in
the in the mid 2000s before I got here. We said when you have an appeal
that&#39;s withdrawn, the judge has to look at it and do a new
sentencing. If the judge sees a new factor then he can treat it the way
it should be treated. And that&#39;s a good thing in those cases. But
there are a lot of cases where there&#39;s nothing that has changed. The
person has appeal their DWI, they only had one, to get an interlock put
it, or to come up with money, or to do their substance abuse treatment,
or whatever reason. But yet we require these second hearings for all
those cases. It takes about a half a day, I&#39;m told, in Wake County.
Every Monday morning we have Superior Court. Everybody lines up, decides
they want a remand. They brought their money to court and are ready to
take care of it. Then they have to fill out this form, assign them
another court room. A clerk has to take the file to the other court
room. And then another District Court judge and another prosecutor have
to sit there and basically say, yes, nothing has changed. This small
change in the bill will allow that to no longer be necessary. A Superior
Court judge and the prosecutor who are consenting to the remand will
have to certify that there have been no new sentencing factors. That
basically means no new charges nor convictions to DWIs since. And so I
would ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Glazier, arise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To debate the bill and explain two
sections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Just an
overall comment first and then the explanation of the two sections. I
said this in Judiciary. I think Representative Stam should be commended
on the process he used. He had multiple stakeholder meetings,
transparent out in the open from all sides, for several months to put
this together. It&#39;s a process that worked well and I think got rid
of controversial provisions and put others in that nobody had thought
about until the meetings. I think it&#39;s a great process and
appreciate what he did to get here today. On Part 10 of the bill, which
is disposition of certain types of biological evidence. Very briefly if
you look at the provisions on Page 7 that are existing law, what you
will find is we had put in place a fairly substantial way of dealing
with collections of forensic evidence and how we can store we can store
that, and how long we have to store that given limited space. And for
different types of convictions, there are set times in which it can be
destroyed once those things happen. The issue comes up, given a lot of
space issues and cost issues in storing this. What&#39;s added on Page 8
is what do you do when you have items that are bulky, that are of a
character that render keeping them impracticable or extremely costly for
a long period of time? And can you get in a position where you can
simply take samples and keep those and return items like cars, large
pieces of furniture, or large property? The answer is that we set out a
process that simply allows a Court to hear a petition by the District
Attorney or others that the bulky item is really difficult to keep or
should otherwise be returned to the owner. It gives notice to the
defendant from a due process point of view. The Court will then decide
after a hearing and can return the property. I think all sides agree
that that&#39;s a good process. And finally, Section 12 of the bill
clarifies enhanced penalties for violations of domestic protective
orders. If you look on Page 9 what you&#39;ll see is the ?? language
previously set out, there are certain enhancements that don&#39;t apply
under the prior law to people who were charged with certain things. But
we want it to apply to people who are charged if they&#39;re not
convicted. This simply makes it clear that these enhancements don&#39;t
apply on the conviction side because they&#39;re already enhanced under
the conviction. But just because someone is charged doesn&#39;t mean on
other crimes those other enhancements are going to occur. This allows
this to take place under those circumstances. And I know of no objection
to either provision, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what

  Speaker Changes:for what purpose does the gentle men from ??
Representative ??
Speaker Changes:to debate the bill Mr.Speaker
Speaker Changes:thank you Mr.Speaker thank you members of the house
these two articles are helpful to law enforcement doing their duties and
Representative ?? part 12 allow extension order and again ?? after court
hearing you recall in 2011 0r 2012 ?? we passed  bill which allowed a
court to find  street gain or member of the street or a place being used
by  street gin to commit cries so far could be declared by the nuisance
of the court and the process  was for the the community to bring a suit
usually through the city authorities or place authorities the court ??
was  nuisance and can then order that the nuisance an be abides ?? that
worked well and helped the agencies and the cities and counties to
address these gains and problems we found one problem that is that the
order would expand one in some cases these order would extend up to one
year and when they did the city or county or they continued to debate
the nuisance that found out to start all over again with  new suite that
didn&#39;t seem to make sense we need to expertise matter what seems to
be order this situation ?? after the entry unless extended by the court
for good causes established by the Plymouth after a hearing so
doesn&#39;t take anybody right ?? abide by the nuisance of the community
but does expertise on that matter i ask you to look favorably on that
the second one i want to speak to is part 14  certificate of relief
certificate of relief many people have herd what that is but it simply
court actions that allows some people who because of some criminal
action been involved in long the way that there perhaps applying for job
they requires some kind of certification this allows through the action
of the court for a person to seek  certificate of relief the change is
really not a greater change it simply simplifies the wordings of the
individual who has convicted ?? before it has been listed out class g
class h class i ?? so this just implies the fraction and allows their
partition based upon their most serious offense and have the court
decide whether or nor they should out void  certificate of relief ??
it&#39;s till up to the agency lifting the certification issue or
whatever privilege my be it&#39;s decide to certificate ?? but at least
gives that person chance ?? so risk you to look favor of the owners them
two pieces Mr.chair if i have to make to debate the bill
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen has the floor to continue debating the
bill
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.speaker ?? Representative glaciers comment
bout Representative stamps work on this,this is the really the way as
similar i have side  that we have the particularly technical hard to
deal with legal issues that we re to work together

  It took a long time. It took several months for Representative Stam to
bring this all to fruition, but in the long run, it&#39;s gonna save an
awful lot of money and trouble for our legal system and there are other
things that we work on in this assembly that I would hope we would use
somewhat the same technique. Sit around the table, talk it out, and make
it work, and I urge you to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Iredell, Representative Turner rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister speaker. I would also just briefly add that how proud
and pleased I was to be a part of this bill, and how judiciously it was
created by getting all the stakeholders together. I don&#39;t think
we&#39;ll have any push back from this, because the people who would
have been involved in clamoring about this were there at the table. So
this is the way we should do business, and I appreciate Representative
Stam for bringing this together and allowing me to be part of it as the
others have said. I&#39;m happy to give my blessing and ask that you
vote green. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Stam rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam moves to amend the bill on page seven, line 12
through 13.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker and the House, of all the amendments I&#39;ve ever
offered, this is the least significant, but please vote for it anyway.
It just conforms the title to an internal title to the text.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment itself. If not, the
question before the House is the adoption of amendment one offered by
Representative Stam, the second reading of House committee substitute of
House bill 173. So many favoring the adoption of the amendment will vote
aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk
will lock the machine and record the vote. 115 having voted in the
affirmative and none in the negative, amendment one is adopted. We are
now back on the bill. For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston,
Representative Hastings rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Stam would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Gaston?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield. I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, very respectfully, I didn&#39;t have the luxury of
being on any of the committees, so I&#39;m trying to work my way through
this bill here quickly, and going over the misdemeanor punishment chart.
In the sexual battery issue in section six, just to clarify, the sexual
battery is an A1 misdemeanor, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. That&#39;s the most serious misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then I&#39;m looking over the prior conviction levels, the one, two,
and three conviction levels, and I&#39;m just wondering if it was the
intent when we&#39;re trying to determine if the person has mitigating
or aggravating circumstances, I&#39;m assuming that depending on the
level, one, two, or three, that would be relevant when that decision is
made regarding whether that person is a danger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized for a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And, and respectfully, I apologize, I&#39;m trying to work my way
through this, but in the A1 misdemeanors, that&#39;s considered serious
enough for some people to receive active time. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, and actually, many people don&#39;t know it&#39;s more
likely to get active time on an A1 misdemeanor than a class I felony.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Lee, mister Reives rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just note for the record I hit the button early so I&#39;m going
to be now repeating what Representative Faircloth and Glazier just said.
I just wanted to commend Representative Stam. As a person who&#39;s done
criminal prosecution and criminal defense, I thought he did an amazing
job getting together the stakeholders on this matter, talking it
through, and making sure they came up with a good., clean bill that
worked for everybody. Came up with a lot of compromises

through. I notice something that he started last year and for him to
identify the problem, and to work on it like he did, I think is
commendable, and I like Representative Faircloth and hope to see a lot
more of that during this session. Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
And for what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Bishop, rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Inquiry of Representative Stam.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Does the gentleman--
SPEAKER CHANGES
I yield.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Stam, I noticed in Section 11 A
of the bill--and I&#39;m a civil litigator so I don&#39;t know that much
about the rest of parts--but there seems to be a great revision to Rule
803 of the Rules of Evidence to permit custodians of business records to
authenticate those records not by live testimony but as the rule&#39;s
now revised to say, it says or by a certification made by the custodian
or witness. My question is, is that--is the intention there the word
&quot;certification&quot;--is that to mean an affidavit?
SPEAKER CHANGES
It could be an affidavit. I don&#39;t think it has to be an affidavit,
but this is--as I understand it this is the federal rule.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Does the gentleman yield for a follow up?
SPEAKER CHANGES
I do.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The word--I just did a quick search through the Rules of Civil Procedure
and the only place the word &quot;certification&quot; appears is in the
rule ?? context where an attorney&#39;s signature is taken to be a
certification of certain things like well-grounded in fact and so forth
to rule that an ??. If this--I believe this would be a very useful
change if it were made clear that the requirement is to have an
affidavit. I&#39;m unfamiliar with--I can&#39;t speak specifically as to
whether this language has been put in federal Rule 803, the
certification language, but it&#39;s otherwise to me unknown. I believe
it would be a great revision if it were an affidavit, and that would be
a better word.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Bishop, and you do more litigation than I do--I&#39;m
going to object--as I mentioned, I&#39;m objecting to third reading, and
if we could overnight get the answer to that, that would be great.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I thank the gentleman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Being no further discussion, no further debate, the question before the
House is the passage of House Bill 173, on its second reading. All those
in favor will vote aye, all those opposed will vote no, the clerk will
open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and close the vote. The
ayes are 116, and one in the negative and the bill will be--the bill
passes, it will remain on the calendar for third reading. Representative
Stam?

I forgot to object, but you left it on the calendar. Thank you. You read
my mind.

I know everybody&#39;s been sitting here long enough today, but I wanted
to remind you that if you didn&#39;t remember and see all that today,
that this is Ag Awareness Day. It is the number one industry in North
Carolina, and we&#39;ve got a goal that by 2020 we&#39;re going to be to
$100 billion and we&#39;re working on that. There was one point that I
wanted to remind people about. Sometimes we don&#39;t think this, that
of the 52,400 farms in North Carolina, 90% of them are small farms. So
agriculture in North Carolina is spread across a lot of things in a lot
of different ways, and I think we tried to make people aware today
particularly of that, and I appreciate your indulgence of that. Thank
you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Colleagues, I just want to announce that as in past sessions we have now
formed what will be the joint county caucus. This, I believe started out
as an informal caucus. Representative Carney, Representative Justice,
and others years ago brought together former county commissioners and
people that were particularly interested in county sets of issues, and
it evolved to a formal caucus, and I anticipate in the near future
we&#39;ll announce our first caucus meeting of the session probably one
afternoon after session, and thereafter as with some of the other
caucuses have a probably early morning day where we&#39;ll have the
opportunity to look at legislations going forward, talk about subjects
of mutual concern. The chairs of the caucus are Representative Carney
and myself for the House and Senators Foushee and Davis for the Senate.
And all members of the House and the Senate who are former county
commissioners are sort of automatically members of the caucus initially,
although all members of the House and the Senate are, have the
opportunity to join and participate in the caucus as you, as you so
desire. So I just wanted to announce, mister Speaker, that the caucus
has now been formed. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Noted. Messages from the Senate. The clerk will read.

Mister Speaker, it is ordered that messages be sent to your honorable

Thank you, sir. Announcement is that the committee on homeland security,

Carolina. I expect it to be an intriguing and eye opening presentation.
Seating is limited in that room, but you&#39;re welcome to come and
attend if you&#39;d like to hear what he has to say. For the point of
personal privilege, I hope this will not be out of order. If you so
rule, I would not argue, but I would like to say thank god that Benjamin
Netanyahu won his reelection yesterday. I would like to say that the

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Speaker, I want to announce the continuation of
the legislative prayer caucus. In 2011 North Carolina was among a
handful of the first states to form a legislative prayer caucus as an
official caucus of our state legislative body. The state caucuses are
patterned similar to the congressional prayer caucus, which was
established by Congress in 2005. Since North Carolina, other states have
since followed with legislative prayer caucuses as well. The North
Carolina legislative prayer caucus adopts these purposes: One is to
recognize the vital role that God&#39;s answer to prayer has played in
the establishment and the continued success of our state and nation, and
in making us a more generous, more cooperative, and more forgiving
people than we otherwise might have been; number two, to collect,
exchange, and disseminate information about prayer to God as a
fundamental and enduring feature of life; and number three, to use
legislation to assist the state and its people in continuing to draw
upon and benefit from this essential source of our strength and
well-being. Our members also work to preserve the presence of religion,
faith, and morality in the marketplace of ideas. We&#39;re dedicated to
protecting religious liberty and recognizing the rich spiritual history
of our state and our nation. Mr. Speaker, I serve as the house chair of
the legislative prayer caucus. Senator Norman Sanderson serves as the
senate chair, and we&#39;re pleased to announce the continuation of our
caucus. Thank you.
