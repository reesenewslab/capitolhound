  <p id="00:00">Senate will come to order. Senate will come to order. Sergeant-at-arms
will close the doors, members will go to their seats, members and guests
in the gallery will please silence all electronic devices.  Before we
get started today, let me remind all our guests in the gallery that the
senators that are before you on the floor today are your voice here on
all matters, and so they are the only ones we will be hearing from
today. So please, in the gallery, please stay silent and let your
senators speak on your behalf. Leading the senate in prayer today is
Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us bow our heads and
pray. Oh mighty God, we thank you for fresh mercy that falls down every
morning. Through light heralds the beginning of a new day. In
thanksgiving for your faithfulness and constancy, we bring these prayers
before you today, Lord. We pray for clearheadedness today. We pray for
endurance. We pray that these senators might keep in mind those that
they serve. Keep all leaders here, especially those to my left and to my
right, from the deception of self-righteousness, and guide them in the
ways of humility. Alert us to the peace that we can impart on others,
which comes from your storehouse of blessing. Show each of us how to
walk this day in love, as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a
perfect offering. May the Lord bless us, keep away evil, and lead us to
eternal life. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berg is recognized for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. The journal of

services to somebody, and it's going to be those same people that's hurt
by the tax break. I urge you to reject this and hopefully, on the 4th

Third reading-non roll call, public bills, House Bill 94--the Clerk will

[Speaker Changes] House Bill 94, Amend in Environmental Laws, 2013.
We have a discussionary debate.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President-
Senator Bryant, for the purpose you ask?
[Speaker Changes] To debate the Bill.
Senator Bryant has the floor to debate the Bill.
[Speaker Changes] On yesterday, I objected to third reading to look
at the amendment regarding the request of the Commission for Public
Health to make rules regarding smoking in restaurants and bars, and
while I think while we're putting in a time clock because one employee
is late, and we can really probably deal with that one situation we know
about- I am supporting the bill.
I do regret that we're fast-tracking those rules, and also regret
that we're opening up a situation that has been working well for our
restaurants, bar owners, tobacco growers, and health advocates since we
enacted this ban. So, I'm concerned about that. But ,thank you for the
time to look at the details of the statutes that were put in, thank you.
Thank you, Sandra. Is there any further discussion or debate?
-Senator Nesbitt, for the purposes you ask?
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. President; to speak on the Bill.
Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak to the Bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate,
this is an interesting bill. The ?? issue is something that is new all
to us and we've been going through it and number of us are concerned
about the environment, and the fact that we may be getting cart before
the horse. You can remember, when were started on this, we were going to
to do a study, and come back and kind of do it. And we decided well, we
didn't really need to do all that-we just do it and everything will fall
into place. And we created the Mining Commission to put together the
rules about how we would proceed. To be honest with you, it scared me to
death. I didn't have a lot of faith in the Mining Commission, and what I
read in the paper about appointments, I've had even less faith in it.
But, it was the group that was going to do something, and they were
meeting in public, and they were taking input and moving forward; and
now I found out that they are about our only hope. What we've done here
is basically take the transparency out of Fracky.  We're going to allow
people to put into our ground-chemicals, which we don't disclose enough
information about for people to be on the watch for. And this was your-

with its public comment and its input and come up with the proper rules
on this.

Thank you, Mr. President.  Apparently there’s technological glitch
when I handed the bill up yesterday it appears that the IPC Code was
scanned and it scans a different amendment than the one I handed up and
that we voted on.  All those amendments does is it makes the Act
effective date.  It deals with the laws that were filed before  Superior
Court cases.  All of those that were filed prior to the effective date
will nto be affected by this amendment and by the bill itself and I
would simply appreciate your support.  That’s what we thought we were
voting on yesterday.

So here to discuss your debate, Silverstein, for the purpose of your
eyes, to debate the bill, Silverstein has afforded- debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you. Members of the Senate, last night,
there were about twenty people in the gallery because you tried to sneak
this bill through without letting the people know. Well, look around
you. This is the result of people talking from 8 p.m. to midnight last
night. Wait until they read the paper this morning, or read the paper
over the weekend. The lesson is pretty clear- when you infringe upon
people's fundamental, constitutional rights, you spark them to action.
The purpose of this bill is to make it harder, more onerous for
healthcare professionals to bar women access to a
constitutionally-protected medical procedure.  It does it in a number of
ways: it limits a woman's ability to pay for the services by denying
them access to insurance. This is so, even though the Affordable Care
Act require that there be no taxpayer money go to pay for an abortion.
Yet, you all say that no one can get health insurance through the
exchange that has abortion coverage.
The Bill also interferes with local government's decisions about what
health care benefits to provide their people. This is but one more
example of you here, in Raleigh, telling local communities that you know
better than them what their people merit. No one believes that abortion
should be performed for sex selection. But this bill authorizes a
disgruntled spouse, a guardian to bring a civil action against the
provider making such an allegation, introducing a threat of litigation,
and massive fines.
The bill imposes burdens on care, dictating to the doctor how to do
his or her job. It requires that the physician prescribing the drug to a
person sit with that person while it's being administered. A medical
abortion-one which is carried out using medication is five times safer
than Viagra. If you really care about-you are essentially tripling the
requirements on them for absolutely no medical purpose. Of the 36
clinics in North Carolina; only one, which is in Asheville meets this
standard. So you're saying that any woman chooses to exercise her
rights, she has to drive to Asheville, no matter if they live in
Wilmington, or Charlotte, or Raleigh.
These standards include things about ventilation systems, in-surgical
syncs, type of linoleum and the type of paint--things that have
absolutely nothing to do with what happens in a clinic.

Procedure after procedure ??? Clinics providing woman healthcare
options. Your efforts will not however change what decision a woman
makes when facing that most intense, most personal, and most difficult
decision as to what to do with their pregnancy. And the sad irony is
that the result of your bill will cause more unwanted pregnancies to
occur. Because the bulk of what these clinics do is provide reproductive
healthcare counseling, family planning, and reproductive healthcare. So
by shutting them down you're denying woman access to the birth control
that keeps them from having unwanted pregnancies. Furthermore, you shut
them down...woman are still going to want to have abortions. We as a
state and a nation have been there. In the 60's and 70's. We know what
the consequences are. Please let us not go back to those days. The irony
that you all attach these anti-abortion provisions on the anti-shariah
law is really astounding.

Excuse me Senator. This will be the last warning for the gallery.
Your voices will be silent.

In recognition that the United States Constitution and the
constitution of North Carolina constitute the supreme law of this state.
The general assembly hereby declares that it be the public policy of
this state to protect its citizens from the application of foreign law
that would result in a violation of a fundamental constitutional right
of a natural person.
That's what this bill says. It's about some foreign law, anti-shariah
law. There's not a single instance ????
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Vote against this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Mckezic has the floor, speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I find this bill deeply deeply disturbing. We are rolling back the
hands of time on the rights of woman in North Carolina. Rather than
being pro-active in protecting their rights, their liberties, and their
constitutionally protected zone of privacy. Instead we're invading it.
Since Roe V Wade Supreme court decision allowing abortions it was based
upon the right of privacy but yet today we're further intruding on that
zone. Last year you passed bills saying that woman would have to listen
to a fetal heartbeat. They'd have to go back home and they'd have to
think and reflect before they're making the most personal decisions of
their lives. Now we're saying we've got to have doctors interrogate them
as the reason their seeking abortions to see if it was based upon the
gender of the child they may be carrying. These are uniquely and
intensely and immensely personally decisions. We should not be invading
on that constitutionally protected zone of privacy. And we're literally
putting a padlock on the door of every abortion clinic here in North
Carolina through these stringent new standards that are contained in
this bill.
Within their lives ???

They are immensely personal decisions pertaining to children they may be

Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the amendment.

Pretty  straight forward amendment.  Even if a hospital chooses not
to offer abortions as part of what they do in terms of what their
doctors’ privileges might be, what it would simply say is if you went to
an abortion clinic, some of the facilities that did.  But for some
reason, there is an emergency condition that occurred relating to you
health as a result of that procedure, that hospital that normally would
not require or allow abortions to be conducted there would be required
by emergency care if that person showed up at their door needing help.
We shouldn’t turn our backs on people in these situations.  We don’t
know who may be coming forth.  We don’t know what the circumstances
might be but we want to make sure that…

organizations across the state on this particular piece of legislation.
I would have loved for them to come to my office and help me understand
why this is a good idea from someones perspective, or why this is
terrible legislation.  Let's not afford it that opportunity.
Let's not afford it the opportunity to talk to the folks in the city
of  Charlotte and ? county. And how they will be impacted on this based
on their providing insurance coverage. Did not have the opportunity to
do that, because the citizens were not afforded the opportunity to be
heard. So they were silenced today, and they were silenced last night.
Because no one knew what was coming.
Transparency is important on major legislation.
Because we don't respect our own rules. We changed them to fit our
purpose. We introduced a major piece of legislation during a holiday
week when even members on both sides are absent. The house is not even
in session this week. And we roll it out in the middle of the evening.
-family, faith, and freedom.

  <p id="50:00">And before that Texas. We were pleased to come to a state that was a
beacon of enlightenment. How sad to see our fall from a leader in the
South to one of egregious denier of rights. This bill claims to make
women safe, but we know that is not what the bill is all about. Forty
years of safe abortion procedures in North Carolina and one clinic.
Forty years, one clinic. The rest closed down. In other words, we do
have the oversight in making sure that women are safe. And we're not
Philadelphia, we have oversight. And I just want to contrast our safety
record with the thousands of medical errors that occur every year in
other areas of medical care, about a hundred thousand a year. What we
have now is something that has been declared safe. One in one hundred
thousand procedures have an occurrence. Where as Viagra, five in one
hundred thousand, this from the Association of Reproductive Health
Professionals. But, what we've also got, is we're losing by closing
these clinics for no reason at all. Those based in medical science.
We're losing for these patients cancer screening, health checkups,
family planning for income women without insurance. When we put this in
a bill with Sharia. A person has watched a video on the consequences and
health risks of taking a drug or chemical. And the patient the man
certifies in writing before the administration of the drug or chemical
that the events described have occurred. I urge your support. [SPEAKER

I heard you say that sir. And I understand that in any profession,

had problems doesn’t mean that the other clinics in North Carolina has
the same problems.  My point is that we do have regulations in the state
to catch those kind of clinics that’s making those kinds of mistakes.  I
just would like to say my colleagues, they have done an excellent job
debating this bill and saying why it’s was such an atrocious shameful
bill and I just want to make it clear that this bill is not about health
care safety for women.  But this bill is about dictating to women about
their personal medical decisions that should be left to a woman and her
doctor.  Last night, I said that this bill is going to cause more
back-alley abortions and that’s what is gonna happen whether you want to

have a choice to go to a medical facility or doctor then you are indeed
restricting my right. Or any other woman’s right to make a choice.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Senator Parham, do you yield for a follow up
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Senator Parham, how is this bill restricting...
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	...be able to have insurance to do this. You are
aware of course that the Federal government only allows it, as in this
bill, for incest, rape and for the possibility of death of the mother.
And that is what is practised in 32 other states. So do you consider it
a right that it’s a requirement for other people to pay for an abortion?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Senator, I did not make a statement about insurance
but I also understand in this bill there will be limitation on the
ability to acquire insurance for an abortion procedure.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Senator Parham, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Senator, I’ll ask again. Do you think other than the
things I mentioned, rape, incest and the life of the mother, that you
think that it should be a requirement for someone else to pay for a
woman’s abortion?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	First of all Senator it’s my opinion for what a
woman decides....to do is shouldn’t count in this. I don’t think we
should deny access to a woman making a decision that should belong to
her and her doctor period. In my opinion about another woman’s body
should not count.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Mr President, I’d like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Senator Wade has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]	Certainly there are choices to be made and there’s
nothing in this bill that would affect any woman’s right to make a
choice with their doctor on what they decide on abortion. The only thing
I see in this bill is that it would limit anyone else from having to be
required to pay for an abortion that wasn’t due to incest, rape or the
life of the mother. The other thing I would like to mention we all could
have a choice if we want to help contribute to a fund called Carolina
Abortion Fund. It’s a non profit that helps low income families that
might be facing abortion. It’s a choice that each one of us could make
if we want to donate money to that cause  but as for a requirement to
pay for someone else’s abortion I would support this bill that limits my
right as a woman in making it only if you’re using taxpayers’ money for
incest, rape or the life of the mother. And I see nothing in this bill
that limits my right as a woman to make a choice with my doctor and make
my own personal choice. Thank you.

about the uh, the guy’s nail clinic, um, and came across the Grand Jury

even though the press didn’t want to talk about it.  One of the most
bizarre things, and this is coming from the Grand Jury report, on page
248, and just so you’ll know some of the background of why the
recommendations were [silence].  So among that background, among other
things, this doctor was using a minor, working her 50 hours a week, she
was administering drugs [silence].  [approximately 1 minutes and 30

Vermin, insects, rodents, and litter.  The regulations devote three
pages to anesthesia protocols.  Valnoise [sp?] facility fell far below
the basic minimum standards of care that any patient having a surgical
procedure should expect to receive.  There is no justification for
denying abortion patients the protections available to every other
patient of an ambulatory surgical facility and no reason to exempt
abortion clinics from meeting these standards.  So that’s the
recommendation of the Grand Jury in Pennsylvania who was dealing the

I’m sure we’re all aware of, we have the Fourth of July coming up
tomorrow, and you know, we celebrate our freedom and our family and our
independence.  But it is also the most holiday that watermelons are
sold.  A few years ago our U.S. Congress declared July the national
month of the food, being watermelons.  In 2011, we done the same here in
North Carolina.  Each one of you has received a [???4:20], a watermelon
and a sprite melon in your offices, including you, Mr. President, and I
hope ya’ll enjoy it, and if the quality’s not quite good as you’re
accustomed to receiving I apologize for all the rain, but I can’t
control that.  But thank you all and happy Fourth of July to all of you.
