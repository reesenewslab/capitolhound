I need a sergeant at arms up front please, now.
One like to welcome you to day two of the rules committee on this
beautiful Thursday in Raleigh. First I’d like to introduce our pages. We
have Richard Perago from Roxboro. Richard, welcome. Jamario Williams
from Henderson. Welcome. Looks like Carly Robertson from Kerry, Carly
welcome. Autumn Fulton from Pleasant Garden, welcome. Is it Makayla
Smith, is that correct? Welcome. Candice Brown, welcome. Ruth Parsons,
welcome. And last but not least, Erin Ray, welcome.
Thank you for your service this week. Ya’ll have been, by far, the best
group of pages I’ve seen this whole session.
It’s true every week, Senator Brown, thank you. It just keeps getting
better. I wish I could say the same about the members. OK.
We’re going to start off…
If anyone wants to speak on any of these bills, I guess mainly the
medicaid bill, sign up sheet’s in the back. I ask you to please go ahead
and sign up. Representative Hager, you still with us? Let’s talk a
little bit about Lake Lure. That is HB1056. Welcome, always good to have
you here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Rules Chair, I just wanted everyone to know
you are my favorite Rules Chair, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I don’t have a lot of competition, but I do appreciate the
compliment. Representative Moore, agrees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lake Lure map, guys, is self-explanatory. I’ll stand to ask any
questions on budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise over there and I got all kind of whirlybirds going around
here for favorable report on House Bill 1056. Lake Lure Official Map. I
didn’t know Lake Lure needed a map. It’s not that big. But anyway, any
questions or debate on this? Hearing none,all those in favor of the
passage or the favorable report to 1056 say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sounds pretty good. It passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Who will run this. Senator Hise?
Andrew, you ready? Ok. You want to start with 883? OK. We’re going to do
Senate Bill 883. We have a PCS that Senator Brown moves we bring before
us for consideration. All those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, it is so before us. Senator Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This could technically classify as an agency
bill. This bill was requested by DENR. It establishes a state group to
address objections to the rules that will include representatives from
environmental engineering firms, stream mitigation firms, industry,  DOT
and DENR. In 2004, the stakeholder group unanimously approved a new set
of rules that are both supported by industry and environmental groups.
What the bill will do is direct EMC to adopt a new consensus language
developed by broad stakeholder group through temporary rule-making by
October 1st of this year. If the construction has occurred under a
federal permit and follow federal stream and buffer mitigation
guidelines and two, the pipe stream is now underground in a stream
buffer, is not longer relevant, adjacent to the pipe stream. DENR has
signed off on this and let’s say it was requested by them part of the
rule-making process.  Of getting...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Brock. Senator Meredith moves unfavorable on the
original bill, favorable to the proposed committee substitute on Senate
Bill 883. Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all those in
favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
‘
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed nay. Ayes seem to have it. Let’s go to House Bill 201. Senator
Brown moves that we bring the PCS for House Bill 201 before us for
consideration. All those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed, no. It is now before us. Senator Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee, this is a bill that
started out as good bill over in the House and we’ve tried to make it a
little bit better by making some changes. Just as a brief overview that
last year in North Carolina, there were over 2500 naked buildings
representing over 153,000,000 square feet of unutilized space. Meaning
industrial and commercial industries considering locating in North
Carolina or expanding in North Carolina, have stated that the energy
code and environmental regulation has prohibited them...</p>

from even considering a vacant space. Let me tell you what this means
personally. We lost a thousand jobs in Davie County. A thousand jobs
went to another state and that state’s other press release said thank
goodness for North Carolina’s regulations. My people need some work and
this will help do it and we can utilize our empty meals without using
any type of...they have a choice to either use the new energy code or
use the other energy code which will allow them to use the existing code
that was in 2009.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, I’ve got a couple of favorable motions. You want me to go
ahead and roll with those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d be happy to let you talk a little longer if you’d like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Senator Jenkins moves for a unfavorable to the original bill,
favorable to the proposed committee substitute for House Bill 201. Any
discussion or debate amongst the members?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to send forth an amendment. It’s just clarifying language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock send forth an amendment. Senator Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This would actually change language in the bill, more of a technical
change of using building area instead of floor area. So it’s footprint.
We talked with insurance agency, it’s what we already have in the
statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion or debate? Senator Meredith. Discussion or debate on the
amendment. Hearing none, all those in favor of the amendment presented
by Senator Brock to 201 say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So passes. We’re back to the proposed committee substitute as amended.
Senator Meredith are still holding with that motion, unfavorable to the
original but favorable to the proposed committee substitute as amended.
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all those in favor say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed, nay. It barely passes. Senator Stein, you all right with
it? Senator Wade, you OK with it? I didn’t want to rush you. OK, thank
you.
Let’s go back.
Senator Harrington moves that we bring House Bill 1181, a new proposed
committee substitute before us for discussion purposes. All those in
favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed, no. All right. We have the new PCS for 1181. Senator Hise,
can you tell us what’s different with this one than the one we had
yesterday?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As far as I’m aware, all the PCS changes are the technical changes that
came in regard to number others that were identified yesterday that were
coming in, that’s what I have at this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate , you agree with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ryan Black, legislative drafting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh there you are, Ryan, good to see you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify, there were two additional clarifications. These were
included in the email I sent out to the committee yesterday. There were
a lot of questions about whether or not the board would be employees of
the state so I added language to clarify that they are not employees,
they are indeed board members just like other board members within the
state. Also made...see if there were additional…
There were a lot of questions about how they would relate to the state
ethics act so I added some language to explicitly say that they would
indeed be public servants under the state ethics acts, operations state
ethics acts would make them subject to it, but I just add basically
cross-reference clarifying language with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let’s go to the committee first. Any further discussions, any further
questions from the committee? We’ll back down from the committee to
other members of the Senate. Any questions for those? All right. We’ll
go to members of the House. Anyone from the House? Representative
Dollar, would you like to ask any questions about this fine piece of
legislation? Or Representative Hager?</p>

<p id="10:00">
Mr. Chairmen, I would have ?? questions. I’ll try a couple just for
size. What is the plan for the management of state dollars that are
currently managed with the LME/MCOs. Because you know LME/MCOs manage
both Medicaid dollars in the provision of behavioral health services as
well as state dollars. How will state dollars be managed and who will
manage them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As it stands right now, the state dollars that were outside of Medicaid,
unless the discussion was to transfer them to board, would continue to
be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services under the
contracts as they exist.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What would happen if the, if I’m understanding it correctly, the plan
is, at least on paper, saying that the LME/MCOs would still exist or
could exist, but if they went under, if they’re asked...what exactly are
the LME/MCOs going be asked to do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The choices for the LME/MCOs, they may choose to become providers and
actually bid for one of these plans, in which case they would take over
other individual into their plans and provide for both physical and
mental health for those individuals. What I believe is more likely is
they may contract with either type of plan that is in here to be the
mental health provider for those organizations as they try to put
together a network of benefits that covers the whole person. Especially
given the timeline, that would be the most likely path in which provider
led networks and outside organizations would put together a network that
was coming forward. As they choose to continue or move on they will make
those business decisions on their own.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. They’re not providers so how would they be
providing services when the LME/MCOs are not providers at all. Why would
you have several, in that instance, multiple layers of care management
and management of the dollars in the system because they’re not
providers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, but they are establishing contractual relationships and they are a
capitative organization which would already have a lot of that framework
in place to build toward an ACO or MCO that’s coming into a particular
region. Most importantly, the value they hold is they hold a network of
providers already established and covering a region.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Some other questions. Is there any state in which there are zero carve
outs, because the way I read the plan, there’s no carve outs with regard
to any of the specialized populations. There’s obviously no carve outs
for dental or pharmacy or long term care, so any entity would have to
cover all of the behavioral health, all of the specialized populations,
all of the dental, all the long term care services that an individual
might need, or might be covered under some program within Medicaid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my answer to that is, I’ll probably start with because we’re one
of the only states I know that has their IDD population under capitation
for that operation. I would say that it is probably unlikely that other
states have all this, unless, of course they’re a service in which its
still run by the state and the department of Medicaid or whatever their
equivalent is in which the state running it provides all those services
to all individuals as we currently do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Thank you. Let’s go to the audience now. Who’s up on the list. Jeff
Meyers is number one. Please step up to the mic, identify yourself.</p>

<p id="15:00">
Press the button. [SPEAKER CHANGE] There you go, I hope you can hear me
OK. My name is Jeff Meyers I'm the President and Chief Executive Officer
of the Medicaid Health plans of America. We're the largest trade
association of managed Medicaid plans. Our members operate in 34 of the
37 states that have [capitated] risk plans. Our members insure about 20
million beneficiaries which is about half of the covered lives in the
united states for Medicaid that are under some form of coordinated care
program. And our plans are as large as United and Aetna, to about 30
percent of our plans are based solely in 1 state and of those most of
them are nonprofit. So we have a general overview and opinion of how a
managed medicaid works and I'm happy to answer any questions or provide
any data that you may need as you consider it. There are 2 issues that I
wanted to address today that I've seen in the press and have been raised
by our members. The first is a general concern that as states move to
managed care, money flows out of the states. That managed care
organizations do not put significant resources into the states in which
they participate. That's not, that's not correct. 2 of our largest plans
that operate currently in North Carolina have a combined 5500 employees.
It is also been our experience as states move to managed care, like
Florida, Louisiana, or Oregon, the plans that are members of ours invest
both financial resources and personnel resources in those states to
managed Medicaid beneficiaries. And that can be as large as five to
seven hundred new employees right at the start. The other issue that
I've heard that I'd like to provide some thoughts on is, excuse me,
excuse me, that providers generally are very concerned when states start
to consider a move to managed care. What we know about managed care
particularly in the Medicaid space is that beneficiaries receive better
care with higher quality outcomes at lower cost in every state in which
managed Medicaid begins to appear. And what we've seen is that while
providers are obviously very concerned, it turns out that over time, as
they integrate into the system, they become more and more comfortable
with it. In several states our member plans have actually increased
payment rates to primary care physicians and others as they've built the
network that the state has outlined for them that they would like to do
as part of the contractual requirement. So I, I know you all have a lot
to do today, I don't want to spend a lot of time in prepared remarks,
but I did want to layout those two issues because it is apparent to us,
as the 37 states that have moved to managed Medicaid and several more
that are considering it, they do it not just for the savings of money,
which is absolutely true, but because we've seen a noticeable increase
in quality metrics for the poorest and sickest in those states. And so
I'm happy to answer any questions MHPA is providing the information to
the members as you all consider this and I will stop here. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Meyers. Appreciate it. Let's go next to Greg
Griggs. Welcome. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. I have not stood here
before which should tell you how important this is to us. I'm Greg
Griggs Executive Vice President of North Carolina Academy of Physicians.
The Medicaid reform plan before you will impost major burdens on North
Carolina's family physicians. Over 90 percent of our states primary care
physicians currently accept Medicaid. They do so in part because of the
efficient delivery system we've built. States relying on managed care
approaches are struggling with physician participation in part because
their systems are confusing and complex. For example, in Florida, which
has been touted here, only about half of the primary care physicians
accept Medicaid. And that's because of the complexity and confusion in
that state and it limits access to care. We've applauded the
legislatures move to lessen the regulatory and administrative burden on
small businesses. Yet the proposal that you're considering will bury
small private physician practices under a mountain of new administrative
and regulatory requirements that will be imposed by multiple managed
care plans</p>

<p id="20:00">
In each region. Rather than one set of pharmacy formularies, one set of
traditional requirements, one set of prior authorization procedures, and
one set of billing programs, practices would be faced with four or more
sets of requirements in each of these areas. The, the proposal is a
significant blow to physicians who own small businesses, providing care
across our state. This proposal also takes much needed healthcare
dollars and ships them out of state for the administrative cost of
multiple corporate manage care plans, rather than leaving the dollars
with healthcare providers in North Carolina who have a vested interest
in our state and its citizens. Healthcare providers who have been here
for a long time and will continue to be here caring for your citizens.
The current proposal ignores sixteen months of hard work and compromise
to design a reform plan that is good for tax payers, good for our most
vulnerable citizens who receive the care, and good for the physicians
and hospitals that provide the care. And it ignores the improved quality
and cost savings we worked to achieve through community care of North
Carolina over the last decade. And if you want to look at the quality
metrics, look at the quality metrics that CCNC has achieved, and it is
better than Medicaid managed care plans in other states. North
Carolina's family physicians recognize Medicaid reforms are needed and
are prepared to embrace change, and we've worked to compromise, but this
plan creates unknown problems in an unproven infrastructure that will
provide no input for those actually providing the care. On behalf of our
thirty six hundred members on the front line of healthcare throughout
our state, we urge you to vote no on this proposal. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Griggs. Next, Pam Kilpatrick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning Mister Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Pam
Kilpatrick. I'm here from the Office of State Budget and Management. I
appreciate having just a couple of minutes to speak to this committee
about implementing the Medicaid modernization legislation. We've had an
opportunity to do just an initial review of this with a mind towards how
we would carry it out, how we would actually put it in place. So with
that caveat, that we are not lawyers, I'm not a lawyer, looking at it in
terms of being able to get a new department up and running, I would like
to share a few considerations. There are some immediate time lines that
have to be fulfilled in this legislation, for example, creating the new
department by October, by August first, establishing an entity for it as
a new state agency by September first, identifying and compensating
essential personnel, which certainly will involve working with the
beacon systems to get those folks their five percent bonus, and do all
the requisite planning. By March first, the new board, the new entity,
has a report due on initial reform planning to the general assembly, so
as we look at it from state budget we would expect what we need to do is
get some staff in place so that this board is well supported. Some
fiscal management staff to be able to do the processing of the
reimbursements, and again some policy staff if it's the desire of the
board so that it can meet those initial planning and reporting dates
that are just several months down the road. In terms of how this takes
place, from an administrative perspective, there are a number of moving
parts. Typically, when the state budget office has had to be involved in
implementing, either creating a new entity or reorganizing entities that
exist into a new structure, we would partner with the Office of State
Controller to coordinate your state level management agencies so that we
can get those systems in place, the structures in place, a new banking
account, a new checking account, staff set up and in support of that.
Logistics would include working on space, setting up securities, IT, and
administrative support. What would the time line be? Again, there are
some fairly immediate deliverables and some long term deliverables in
this legislation. The time line would, would vary depending on the
complexity of the agency. The size of, of, of the budgets, the
complexity of the program. Certainly Medicaid is, is complex. So how
that would be carried out, we would hope that there could be time to
plan a transition</p>

working with our state partners, working with the affected parties. We'd
be more than welcome, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, if we
could assist the Legislature in developing a timeline, if that would be
appropriate. And again, how ever the legislation is enacted, we're
committed to making sure that it's an orderly process. Thank you so
much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Next, we have Mary Hooper? Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, thank you. It's Hooper, so it's close.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Mary Hooper, I'm the Executive Director of the NC Council of
Community Programs, excuse me, and I represent the LME/MCOs across the
state. I do want to thank the Chairs and the members of the committees
for their work regarding improvements in the Medicaid system. We know
that your goal is to improve Medicaid services to the citizens our
state, and we appreciate that and we support your goals. We request that
in your process of making these improvements, that you not destabilize
parts of a system that are currently functioning. As you know, the
LME/MCOs are using managed-care principles; they are capitated, they are
not causing cost overruns, and they are fiscally responsible. Over the
course of the past year, the Medicaid Reform Advisory Group spent a
great deal of time hearing from stakeholders across the state. One of
the consistent themes that you heard was the theme and the request that
you not destabilize that which is working in this state. I'm here to
tell you that as you look at Medicaid reform, and as you struggle to
embrace principles of managed care, the LME/MCOs are actively involved
in managed-care activities. They are an example of successful public
behavioral managed care. We respectfully request that you not take that
part of the system apart in your efforts to improve others parts of the
system. Your LME/MCOs, at the community level, are actively working with
providers, stakeholders, and consumers in your communities, to ensure
that your constituents are receiving the services they need. I am not
here primarily and only to represent MCOs. The role of the MCO is to
ensure that consumers get what they need, and I would respectfully
request that we keep consumers at the top of this conversation. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Adam, you're up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, good morning. My name is Adam Sholar and I'm
the legislative liaison for the Department of Health and Human Services,
and I appreciate the opportunity to address the committee this morning.
I just have a couple points I'd like to make. First, I'd like to begin
as I did yesterday, by saying the Department appreciates the Senate's
recognition that Medicaid reform is an important issue. While the
current Medicaid program is in better shape today than it has been over
the past four or five years, and while we're on a path to making it even
better, we still must move to a value-driven Medicaid program, which
will make it a better system for those who receive care, for those who
provide care, and for our taxpayers. We're thankful that both the Senate
and the House share this commitment to reform. We're concerned, however,
with some changes that were made to the reform plan in this version of
the bill. We spent more than a year working with stakeholders, including
the Reform Advisory Group, to come up with a provider-led Medicaid
reform plan that built upon the investments North Carolina made in its
Medicaid program that has broad stakeholder support. The provider-led
plan was embodied in the bill that passed House and we think it's the
best plan for North Carolina and we'd like to see that plan given a
chance to work. ?? the concepts, albeit in a more aggressive timeframe,
remains in this bill. It's now joined at this stage by several new
concepts, including changes to our behavioral health care system. We
have ?? about making this change at this point in time and we
respectfully ask the Reform Plan, based on the work and embodied in the
previous version bill, be adopted. The other new addition to the
Medicaid Reform Bill is the creation of a new department to administer
the Medicaid program. And about this provision we have serious
objections. First, the Department of Health and Human Services believes
that Medicaid is an integral part to its operations. It's intertwined
with our Division of Mental Health, our Division of Aging, our Division
of Social Services, our Division of Public Health, and our Division of
Public Health among others. It's intertwined with county Departments of
Social Services, over which we have supervisory authority, and we do not
believe unwinding these functions in this bill will serve the people of
our state the best. Second, as Mrs. Kilpatrick mentioned, there are many
practical concerns that I won't elaborate on as she</p>

<p id="30:00">
Representative: …a great addressing those but we have those concerns as
well. Finally, the government’s new Medicaid department raises serious
constitutional questions. This is an executive branch agency that will
now have a 7 member board  responsible for its administration, but 4 of
the 7 members are appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, the
general assembly. With legislative control over executive branch agency,
it raises constitutional questions, and I think, given the size and
importance of this program, right to a challenge in the future that
could hamper the operation of the program and those that serve in the
state. So the decision to grant a new Medicaid agency is one that hasn’t
received the same public study that the model to reform the healthcare
system did. For all of these reasons we would ask that the decision be
given the same consideration, and we would be happy to help with that
study in the interim. Thank you Mr. Chairman for letting me speak this
morning.
Speaker:  Thank you Adam. Okay, Ardis where are you? Come on up - we
need to work on that penmanship. Lisa will be in town this weekend maybe
she can help you on the third grade level. It’s all yours.
[laughter]
Speaker: I wish I could use the excuse that I am a physician, but that
wouldn’t be true. I am Ardis Watkins, which is apparently not legible,
with the state employee association of NC, and I appreciate the chance
to have two minutes with you today. I wanted to say that scenic shares
Representative Dollard’s concerns about the lack of a carve out for
behavioral  health centers, and clients skilled nursing and psychiatric
and developmental disabilities institutions, or places where state
employees can now provide those services. Many of these are long term
clients with multiple medical and cognitive impairments, and that
requires specialized care. It includes those needing innovative
treatment and other methodologies that we believe, firmly, are best
provided at these current facilities. Our state developmental
disabilities center not only provide active care but also conduct
research, which is a very important component. A few weeks ago, some
legislation of this type was floating around where you all were going to
look at these types of facilities and come back, and now it feels like
things are getting pushed through on the 11th hour that would turn all
of that on its head. So, we do want to share Representative Dollard’s
concerns there. The other portion of the bill, under 143B14-15, the
changes there, variations from certain state laws, that would take the
employment rights of certain state employees under the state personnel
act, and that will do nothing but have a chilling effect to employees
who, right now, if they have state employee protections might otherwise
feel compelled to report things such as waste, fraud or abuse that can
happen in the system. We feel it is more imperative than ever with the
issues we have had concerning the Medicaid system and DHHS, that it come
before you as a body, that these employees feel free to be the good
employees they want to be and point out where they can see there are
problems and do that on behalf of the taxpayers and the clients they
serve through DHHS. That is all that I have to say. I thank you for your
time.
Speaker: Senators Page and Heist, would you like to add some comments?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. We have been listening to
everyone and asking questions and drilling down into Medicaid for the
past year. We think we have come up with a bill thanks to our staff and
the input of hundreds of people that will meet the challenges that
medicaid offer this state. I, for one, thank everyone that had input.
You had spoken today. I think it is time to move on and get this
procedure over with. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the opportunity to
have one small piece in getting this legislation before you.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. A few things I wanted to address
that kind of have been said in the comments. First, looking at carve
outs. Since we have began this process, it was the stated legislative
goal, that we would have whole person care. I have talked to providers
that even work</p>

They were some of the organizations that spoke.  They talk about working
with mental health patients and trying to get their medications right
when they can't control their blood sugars cause that has to be another
doctor in another area, because they are separated.  I appreciate the
House's new concerns about carve outs but I would take everybody back to
the house bill also had no carve outs for any areas for LMENCO's or for
other areas of providers. Provider led plans, I understand the
statements made about provider led plans. That is why the only priority
given in the bill is that each region shall have a provider led plan. We
also talk about CC and C and their quality matrix and how they are
hired, that's why we brought CC and C onto the table to develop the
quality matrix for all the plans within the state so that we continue to
grow on what we have in North Carolina.   Provider led plans have the
opportunity now to compete in the state of North Carolina and how us in
this development how they provide better care for better cost, and have
a priority in doing so.
I would also say that I too am shocked at the bureaucracy required in
the state of North Carolina to create a new department. It is something
I think we do have to look at when we get it together but I would also
say I think it is a process that is unacceptable that it takes that much
to move and create a new agency in the state in moving forward,
specially  when we are trying to simplify the process.  No business, as
we are trying to create a business model, would make a process that
complicated in order for it to occur and I think there's a lot we need
to do in those areas as well.
So I thank you all, there have been a lot of individuals that have put a
lot of work into getting this bill before you today. This is the next
step in the process, moving forward, and I look forward to this being
completed in the short session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok I'm going to let Senator Robinson have her question cause she is my
favorite, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair and I apologize, I came in a little late after
you had asked those other questions. I do have several concerns of this
and one and then I have questions other times.  One is that I notice in
Florida that 63% or more of the people who are enrolled in the one
particular area, mostly low income etc. and we know that in North
Carolina those will be the majority of the people who will be involved
in this plan as well and are in Medicaid. And so there was a medical
advisory committee.  My concern here is that a board led mostly by
corporate people who don't have experience in Medicaid, folk who may be
appointed other places we won't have providers in, and people who
corporately provide Medicaid services, that the interest and the needs
of Medicaid recipients will not be or might not be represented. And so,
my question is is this medical advisory did include consumers,
specifically consumers who are Medicaid recipients. Is there any
opportunity to hear for those people to b represented on that board. And
we know that the best model to make sure that services are available to
the recipient is to make sure that consumers are represented on those
boards, so there would be an opportunity for consumers to be represented
on the board. I know your plan doesn't have it but I'm asking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I would start by saying the biggest distinction in what you are
saying between Florida and here is by name. The Florida board is an
advisory board. There is nothing that would prohibit this board from
creating advisory, they have the ability to do sub committees. The
conflict we are trying to avoid with providers is trying to have the
individuals who profit, or their business dependent upon the rate set
and the patients received from Medicaid being the ones making the
decisions about what those rates should be. That would be a conflict we
probably wouldn't accept anywhere else in state government and wouldn't
accept in this legislature for individuals coming in. So what we are
trying to do is put a wall of separation between the actual decision
making and those who will receive</p>

...leave the benefit from the decisions, but I don’t think there’s any
opposition or anything that would prohibit this board from creating
other things that would be advisory to the board in that concept.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one follow up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it would be a novel approach to add a couple of consumers in
some of those positions at this great salary, we’d move them out of
poverty and into another strata.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And General Assembly Members first, right. OK Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chair, at the appropriate time, I’d like to move for a
favorable report to the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it’s very appropriate. Senator Wade moves unfavorable to the
original bill and to the first proposed the first committee substitute
and favorable to the last committee substitute we had before.
All those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So passes. Thank you. Keep an eye on the computer. I’m going to be in
town this weekend, we may meet tomorrow, why knows?</p>
