The first fee listed here in the document, section 9.3, modify teacher
licensure fees for house. What this does, this allows the state board to
set the fees for teacher licensure, consistent with what was in the
senate budget. The only difference between the senate and the house
language, excuse me, is that the provision includes an exception to the
rule making procedures under the administrative procedures act. The
senate granted that exception to the state board for the purposes of
licensure fees indefinitely. The house just grants that exemption for
the 13, 14 year fiscal year only. It's expected that these fees will
bring in approximately 600,000 dollars. The last time these fees were
changed was 1998.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
General government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, there's two more education provisions that are in for UNC,
if I may. Andrea Pulflisker research. Section 11.7, which is on page 91
of your hot off your presses copy this morning, is for student charges
at the School of Science and Math. This provision is identical to the
senate version and authorizes the board of governors to impose a new fee
on non ?? students that don't live at Science and Math for distance
education services, and then also for anyone participating in
extracurricular enrichment programs sponsored by the school, there is no
estimate available on how much these fees would bring in.
The School of Science and Math would be starting these programs up
likely the summer of 2014. The other education provision is on the next
page, section 11.8. This would allow the UNC School of the Arts to
charge fees to resident students.
Some time ago there was an appropriation made to allow the School of the
Arts to stop charging resident students fees, but that appropriation no
longer keeps up with the total cost of those fees to the resident
students, and this would allow them to charge students the difference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As we move to general government, I would ask the analyst, if you are
able to give us the page number that we're working on so folks can stay
together. General government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, at Rodney Bissel fiscal research. The first three items in
the general government section are general provisions which I'll just
briefly highlight. The first one is appropriation of other funds, which
is section 5.1, which is on page eight of your budget document. That is
just boilerplate language that codifies existing transfers. Section 6.2,
which is on page 12 of your budget is establishing or increasing fees
under the act which allows raising fees, commensurate with the budget
act, without consultation with the legislative review committee. Section
6.17 is the restore transitional hold harmless for local governments.
That's on page 23. Currently, local governments receive a hold harmless
payment. This was initiated in the 1990s, when the state repealed
several local government revenue sources, including the property tax on
intangibles and inventories. That state allowed half cent sales tax in
2002 to make up for those lost revenues. For some local governments,
that sales tax did not entirely make up for the repealed local revenues
and this hold harmless has been in place since then to keep them made
whole. That hold harmless payment at sunset, the last payment was in
2012. This section restores that hold harmless payment for one
additional year. The general government team will now continue with
section 19.2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, mam. Yes, mam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lisa Holloway with fiscal research. The next item this shows is section
is 19.2 was an exemption to rule making at the Department of Cultural
Resources. This one is not in the house budget. It was a senate item,
but not in the house, so it was dropped. On the next page, page number
five, is section 20.2.</p>

<p id="10:00">
This is the voluntary safety workers' compensation fund it's on page 254
of the house bill.  This is very similar to the Senate in that it adds
this program to be funded by the Grace Premiums surtax and it reduces by
5% the other two programs so upto 20% will be going into this fund,
after 2 years the full 20% will go in the next  two years.  There is a
corresponding money item as well that will reduces the state
appropriations for this program and the next one  Section 20.3   can be
found on page 258 of the bill this says regulatory surcharge which is
the funds that are used  for the department of insurance, this is gonna
be set at 6% which is same, is the same as what was  in the Senate's
budget, and then moving to page 6, the next Section 21.1 is down on page
258, this repeals the North Carolina   Public Campaign Finance Fund, the
house proposal is  just about the same as the Senate it was ?? little
bit and it increases the availability to the general fund of 3.5 and
those funds are used within the State Board of Election's Force
operating for the next year.  The next one is  Section 27.1 it can be
found on page 262.  This increases the registration fees for  lobbyist
and lobbying principle from the 100 to 250 dollars, this is identical to
the Senate.  It was generated by a 400 thousand annually.  Moving to the
next one 30.1  can be found on page 264.  This is different from what
was in the Senate this retains this program but requires a continuation
review to be performed and must be completed by March 31st of 2014.  And
then moving to page 7, Section 30.2 can be found on page 265, this is
related to the Displaced Homemakers Program.  What the difference here
is that the Displaced Homemakers Program will continue  to receive
funding for this next  fiscal year and you see this split of 35 dollars
and the Domestic Violence Center would receive 40 dollars  beginning in
2014 all of these funds will go to the  Domestic Violence Center Fund
and Madam Chair that completes general government section.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is one final item in Section 6.16 which is found on page 23 at the
budget, the Passenger Air Carrier Sales Tax Refund.  This is a payment
for sales tax, sales tax is paid on aviation field in excess of 1.25
million dollars during the period of January 2011 to June 2011, the
state made a partial payment on the Sales Tax Refund in the budget last
year.  That payment was, that the action in the budget was necessary
because the tax payer filed for the refund late, this provision would
simply allow for the reminder that Sales Tax Refund to be made.  And
Madam Chair the next section is Health and Human  Services and our
analyst for that area can speak to those provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ryan Blankage with legislature drafting we turn to page 8 of the legal
sized sheet. There are two provisions on that page that were included in
the Senate Budget but are not included  in the House Budget.  First of
all, there is a provision related to the Medicaid Management Information
System, our provision in the house provision still contains
appropriations and some reporting acquirements but the house version
does not include a fee that the department could charge.  Second on that
page is they there was a change to certificate of need, when you file
for certificate of need you have to pay a fee because of that
certificate of need, adjustment was made, that is not a fees associated
with that and it's not in the house. Turning to page 9, Section 12, H.7
there is a pre-existing provider application fee that has been in the
Statute, excuse me, not in Statute, it has been in the budget since
2009, that's been in effect since September 1st of 2009, the Senate
qualified this fee, the house version of the provision does not, it's
still a 100 dollar fee to be charged on application and also on
recredentialment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is, excuse me Sir, provision on page 140
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's on page 140 Yes, Mam.  Next 12 H.19 which is on page 149, page 149
that's the hospital  provider assessments, just by a word of background
of the Federal Government allows the State to collect assessments from
certain provider groups for medica</p>

<p id="15:00">
and then can do various things with that money. One thing that we do is
make payments back to providers and we can do that with federal matching
funds, so it helps to increase the total amount of money going to
providers by collecting some money from the providers. Right now the
state collects an additional 43 million dollars as part of that
assessment. The Senate changed that to a collection 15.6 percent of the
total assessments collected, which would have resulted in about 50
million dollars, rather than 43. What the house does is collects a flat
amount of $95,000,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair, Susan Jacobs with fiscal research.
Beginning on page 123, there's two fees for the division of public
health. The first fee increases the permit fee for food and lodging
establishments. The House bill increases this fee from 75 dollars to 95
dollars, and the counties retain all of the receipts collected, because
of that increase. The Senate budget increased that fee from 75 dollars
to 120 dollars. And they had a corresponding cut in general fund
appropriation of over $700,000.
The second fee is also within the division of public health, and it is
on page 127. There is also a corresponding money item in your committee
report on page G6 item number 36. This is an increase of an existing fee
from $1,000 to $1,250.  The decrease in general fund appropriation is
approximately 220,000 dollars, and that's associated with the increase
in receipts. The impact for ?? is approximately $800,000 because they
pay for the majority of the autopsies performed in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am. Justice and Public Safety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam chair.
William Childs from fiscal research.
Starting on the top of page 11. There is an expunction fee. This is
section 18b.16 on page 243 of the bill. This creates a uniform fee for
expunctions of 175 dollars. The way that the House is different form the
Senate, is that the House splits the money between the department of
justice and the administrative office of the courts with 70 percent to
the former, and 30 percent to the latter.
Next fee is, amend motions fee. This is section 18b.17 on page 244. This
limits the motion fee, when a notice of hearing on a motion is filed.
This is identical to the Senate, and there is no estimate available for
this change.
Next is section 18b.18. This is the criminal justice education and
standards commission court fee. This is on page 245 of the bill. This is
identical to the Senate and this has no fiscal impact because it is
changing the distribution of the fee instead of the amount.
The last justice and public safety fee is on page 12. This is section
18b.19. Court costs for the services of expert witnesses providing
testimony about a chemical or forensic analysis of a trial. This is on
page 245 of the bill. This is identical to the Senate. It creates a $600
fee for an analyst to testify about a forensic analysis at a trial. We
have no estimate available for this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Sir.
Natural and economic resources.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam chair.
Timothy Bell with fiscal research.
Section 13.1 of the bill, which is on page 165. This mirrors the senate
proposal. It implements a new four dollar soil testing fee for whats to
find ?? season from December until March, on any given year. It also
increases the expedited soil-shipper fee from from $100 to $200. It
generates approximately $450,000 in new receipts.
The next fee, section 13.8 on pages 166 and 167. This allows the board
of ?? of soil scientists to charge for the actual cost of the
examination fee. Currently, they are permitted by statute to charge
$125. The actual cost of the national exam is $150. This allows them to
charge up to that amount.
Section 13.9 Increase certain commercial fertilizer fees. This is on
page 167 of the bill. This increases the annual registration fee for
fertilizer products weighing less than five pounds. From 30 dollars on
an annual basis to 55 dollars on an annual basis, and generates</p>

$21,000 in receipts.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Madame Chair, Jennifer Hoffman with Fiscal Research, continuing on that
page, Page 13 at the bottom of your chart, Section 14.16 is a Senate
only special provision so you don't find it in the House budget.  The
senate diverted a portion of the scrap tire tax to the general fund, the
House did not.  If you flip your page, Page 14 of your chart, the first
two items on there again are Senate only items where the Senate diverted
a portion of the white goods tax and a portion of the solid waste and
scrap tire tax to the general fund, the House did not, you do not have a
House provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Jennifer, would you give us the page numbers on those?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There is no House provision so there is no page numbers.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I understand, got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Section 14.26 is also a Senate only special provision so there is no
house page number.  This essentially appropriated the severance tax from
Senate Bill 76.  At the bottom of that chart you do have the House
version of the Senate special provision, the House version begins on
Page 188, Increased Funding for Dredging.  The Senate version increased
registration fees for boats and titling fees for boats, the House
version does not.  Instead the House version appropriates an outright
general fund appropriation.  Both versions diverted 1/6 of 1% of the
motor fuel tax to dredging and both versions set up a special dredging
fund.  The amount of diversion is 1.2 of the motor fuel tax but there is
no increase in that tax.  If you flip the page of your chart to Page 15,
section 14.3 covers pages 168-172, that's the Land and Water
Conservation Fund Special provision.  This essentially repeals the
Natural Heritage Trust Fund    and takes those dedicated tax revenues
that used to go to the Natural Heritage which is 25% of the deed stamp
tax and certain special license plates and diverts those monies to the
Clean Water Management Trust Fund.  There is no fiscal impact because
again it is just a transfer of existing monies.  Section 14.4, Deed
Stamp Tax Credited to the General Fund is a House special provision on
page 172.  Essentially the Senate version diverted Deed Stamp Tax to the
general fund and the House does not and again it makes one change and it
diverts money that used to go to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund to the
Clean Water Management Trust Fund.  There is no fiscal impact on that.
The next special provisions are on pages 174-183. This is Marine
Fisheries License and Permit Fees.  This is the same as the Senate.
This multipage special provision essentially increases commercial
fishing licenses and permit fees across the board by 25%.  It also
allows the Marine Fisheries Commission to set new fees up to $100 for
existing permits and it restructures the four higher fishing licenses.
The fees that will be raised are approximately $675,000 and they are to
be used to support the At Sea Observer Program.  If you flip to page 17,
section 14.27 again is a Senate only provision so it does not exist in
the House version of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Timothy Dale again with Fiscal Research.  Section 15.1 on Page 189 of
the bill sets the regulatory fee for the Utilities Commission.  The
House and Senate proposal had increased it from 12 basis points to 13
basis points.  The House has mirrored that provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
?? with Fiscal Research.  Section 15.20 on Page 200 ?? Application Fee
Increase
increases the current application fee from $5,000 to $10,000.  The
estimated impact of this special fund is $90,000.  Section 15.21 is also
on Page 200  ?? Reporting Fee Increase.  This is identical to the Senate
as is the prior one</p>

no estimate is available, but this would increase the JDIG annual
reporting fee to be the greater of either $2500 or .03% of grant amounts
rewarded, not including the utility account transfer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We need to go back to the presenter for JPS for correction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair, William Childs from Fiscal Research, when I spoke
about the motion fee that was on page 11 of the chart and page 244 of
the bill, I said it was identical to the Senate, that was not correct,
there is an amendment that held up only 1 fee may be assessed for any
motion for which a notice of hearing has been filed, so I apologize for
that, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Transportation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, Bryce Paul with Fiscal Research, directly in front of you.
Beginning on page 18 with section 3413, the House proposal for this
provision maintains the existing ferry toll structure. Fares that are
currently in effect and authorizes the department to generate receipts
via advertising and other potential revenue sources. This largely
conforms to the content of House Bill 475, by contrast the Senate
proposal would have required system-wide tolling effective November 1st,
2013, but the faring structures to be determined by the Board of
Transportation subject to a floor and a ceiling. Sections 3415 you will
find on page 275 and 3416 on 276, each of these sections is identical to
the Senate provision and it consolidates existing fees for the
inspections program account and the DMV technology improvement account,
and credits those to the Highway Fund, there is no change in the fee
level. Moving to page 19 with section 3419, 3419 is a Senate-only
proposal that's not included in the House budget, sections 3420 and 3421
likewise are both Senate proposals which are not included in the House
budget. And section 3424 was removed from the House budget for an
amendment yesterday and appropriation, it's no longer included.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rodney Bizzle will discuss page 21.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I would just point out that we do have the
total fiscal impact of the fees indicated on the bottom of page 19, the
total impact of the changes that you've heard discussed for the general
fund are 54.2 million and for special funds, 5.8 million. On page 20, we
have a section called other provisions of note, these are not fees that
would have a revenue impact as the ones we've already discussed, but
these are generally related to finance and things that we wanted to draw
to the committee's attention. The first one in section 30.6, which is on
page 266, simply requires the Department Administration to study the
feasibility of eliminating or reducing the fee that is charged to
support the e-procurement system. Section 6.9, which is on page 16, is a
provision which allows the state budget director or his designee to
access anonymous tax return data from the Department of Revenue for the
purposes of revenue projections. And then the next one, section 2.2 is
just your general fund availability statement which is found on page 5,
the Senate-version of the availability statement had a reserve of 217.1
million, for a finance package of the House Budget Reserves 38.5 million
in FY13-14, and 381.1 million for fiscal year 14-15. And Madam Chair,
the NER team can go through the next several provisions.</p>

Any ??.
[Speaker Change]
Yes ma'am. I bring ?? with fiscal research. Section 15.28 page 206.
Regional economic development commissions statutes creating the
commissions repealed. This is identical to this Senate except that the
repeal of the four state created commissions becomes effective 6-30 of
2014, as opposed to 7-1 of 2013. The next item section 15.18 page 195.
Modify IDF in utility account. Is identical to the Senate it reverses
the change enacted July first of 2012 which limited IDF availability to
the 65 most economically distressed counties to permit use in all tier
one, and tier two counties. It modifies the language requiring that
funds be reserved only for projects that will directly result in the
creation of jobs to projects reasonably anticipated to result in the
creation of jobs. Also eliminates language regarding job retention. It
modifies language requiring that funds be reserved only for projects in
eligible industries by merely giving priority to such industries. And
the remainder of that provision is conforming changes. The next item
JDIG modifications section 15.19 page 199. Is also identical to the
Senate. It requires best efforts on a commerce's part to achieve the
average of the range of percentage it withholdings allowed in
calculation of the minimum and maximum grant. It requires information
sharing with locals within 30 days of submission of a JDIG application.
And it modifies the liability cap to be 22.5 million for the 2013/2015
??. And 7.5 million for July 1st 2015 to December 31st 2015. The next
item section 15.3 page 189. Is the unemployment insurance reserve. This
is different from the House in that it sweeps those division of
employment security fund balances to go to the unemployment insurance
fund for federal debt reduction. And the next item is on page 189 15.4A.
The employment security reserve fund. Makes the 205 million federal
grant all go towards the UI system upgrade as opposed to the House
version which also allowed those funds to be used for UI administration
costs. The final one 15.7A on page 190. Is a new house provision.
Commerce flexibility to reorganize the department to establish the
public, private partnership. It allows the Secretary of the department
to reorganize positions and related operational costs within the
department to establish a public, private partnership, which includes
costs containment measures.
[Speaker Change]
Madam Chair.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Luebke.
[Speaker Change]
On the JDIG portions could we hear from the staff as to how that alters
current legislation? I heard what it changes it up to, but how that is
different from what we currently have?
[Speaker Change]
Aubrey.
[Speaker Change]
Yes ma'am. On the application fee, the current application fee is $5,000
that would increase it to $10,000. The application fee has not been
changed since program inception in 2002. The reporting fee increase is
also a modification since program inception which was $1,500 is now at
$2,500 or the greater of either $2,500 or the .03% of the initial grant
amount less the utility account portion. So as example for that a
company that received a JDIG award like MET-LIFE would now have an
annual reporting fee of approximately $26,000 as opposed to $1,500. The
additional modifications modify the cap. The cap currently is a calendar
year, award cap of $15 million. And this provision allows over the ?? to
be a cap of 22.5 million and then the 7.5 for the first six months of FY
16. It also requires the information sharing with locals within 30 days
of the application which is not currently in statute. And then it
requires the best efforts on commerce's part to achieve the average of
the range of the percentage of withholding allowed in the calculations
of the minimum, the maximum grant. So that range is 10% to 75% and it

[Speaker changes.]...attempt to hit 42.5% per their award cap period.
[Speaker changes.]  Follow up. Representative Luebke?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Madame Chair. Staff? Could you kindly
explain more on &quot;best efforts&quot; concept.
[Speaker changes.] Sir, I'm referring to page 199, Lines 23 through 26
and the language is &quot;the department shall make every effort to
insure that the average percentage of withholdings of eligible positions
for grants awarded under this part does not exceed the average of the
range provided in the withholding section.&quot;
[Speaker changes.] Madame Chair, as you know this has been one of my
favorite bills through the years...the JD Bill...
[Speaker changes.] I remember.
[Speaker changes.] And...(laughter)...so I wanted to ask...so this is
language, as I'm reading it since it's underlined, that it's not in
current statute...the &quot;best efforts&quot;?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.
[Speaker changes.] And, if I may...and so current law is what? Is there
anything in there at all...current law...or is this changing current law
in terms of...basically how the taxpayer will fare because what we're
negotiating here is how much of a break we're giving the corporations in
terms of not having to pay...pay in on behalf of their workers?
[Speaker changes.] The agency actually made this suggestion to help
temper liability of going forward, right now with the 10 to 75%
withholdings range, often...Stewart Dickenson?????? of ???????Finance,
who runs the program, said that companies come in pushing for the
maximum...75% over the course of twelve years and this gives him the
cover to say &quot;we can't make all awards at a 75% level&quot;...it
needs to be on average in the middle of that range, which is 42.5%.
Again, helping temper liability.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Carney?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, Madam Chair...I don't know if I missed it but
could the staff go back over...on page 20, the very last one...section
3426?
[Speaker changes.] Madam Chair?
[Speaker changes.] Staff?
[Speaker changes.] I can cover that provision.  It's Section 34.26 on
page 279, which allows counties to use the Article 46/Local Option Sales
Tax for a variety of transportation purposes.  Counties already have
authority to use this article for any purpose so this is essentially
just clarifying that these funds can be used for transportation
purposes.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Starnes.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.  Well, a coupla' questions but while we're
on that subject...but this is the first time that we're allowing
counties to use this portion of the sales tax for road...highway
purposes, isn't that correct?
[Speaker changes.] Jeff Cherry????, ??????? Traffic Division, as far as
I know, that is correct.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up ?????? Senator Starnes.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. And if this sales tax has been put on
previously, perhaps by referendum,  does this...and then the voters are
told that they would be used for a specific purpose...are counties
authorized then to divert this money that was approved by referendum,
for a highway purpose.
[Speaker changes.] ???????? Traffic Division again...one of 5537 in
statute  specifies the wording of the referendum. The referendum is
not...that's ????? by law for this levy...this particular sales tax does
not specify a purpose so therefore, if they wanna' use it for roads...I
don't think it would be needed to re-referenda????
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Representative Starnes?
[Speaker changes.] Just to make a comment on this provision...using
local money for highway purposes is a pretty new concept and...that
we're delving into here...and I think it's a mistake that if....</p>

...passed a referendum and were told that their sales tax would be
increased for a certain purpose, it needs to be used for that purpose
which they voted on and I think its not good public policy then to come
in later and say, &quot;Well, we're going to divert the money that you
approved for a certain purpose to highway purposes.&quot; But that's
another issue. Let me ask one other question to staff. When you look at
the budget overall, how do counties come out? Have they been pretty well
held harmless or have we pushed additional costs down to the counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't see a staffer quickly raising their hand.
Karen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair? Karen Hemmingsblanks [SP] in fiscal
research. We have not done a specific analysis but in comparing all the
activity in the various subcommittees, I think this budget actually does
less to take money from the counties or to impose additional costs on
counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma'am. Members of the committee, other
questions? Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to comment on what, first, does everyone
in the committee feel that to not that staff wouldn't know, but are the
county commissioners OK with these aspects of the budget? Do we know
that maybe from the appropriations committee yesterday or from any
comments to committee chairs? Because if not, I think it would be
helpful to hear from the county commissioners. Particularly on this
point about using sales tax dollars, which in Durham, the referendum was
about helping education. So is there someone from county commissioners
who could address this, ma'am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm looking to see if I see a representative from the
county commissioners. Kevin Leonard? Rebecca? Anybody here from the
County Commissioners Association? Yes, Rebecca Troutman. Rebecca, would
you like to come up and try to address that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Rebecca
Troutman for County Commissioners Association. I think of what Ronnie
Bisnal [SP] said we would just kind of reiterate that that counties can
already use sales taxes for transportation if they so choose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the overall question, Ms. Troutman, I believe that
Dr. Luebke was trying to address was your comfort level with respect to
this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To the House's budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's right. With the, all the features of the
appropriation fees. The fees here that are here in finance. Thank you,
ma'am, for correcting or heading on direct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, I don't believe that there are, the fee
structure impacts counties. So if we misread the budget, I would
certainly like clarification from staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma'am. Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Rebecca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair, Chairwoman. I guess this is a
question for the staff on page 26, Section 15.18, we move from funds on
the 65 mostly economically stressed counties to 80. Can staff tell me
the breakdown between how many tier 1 counties there are and then how
many tier 2 counties there are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, there are 40 tier 1, 40 tier 2 and then 20 tier
3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, would you repeat that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 40 tier 1, 40 tier 2, and 20 tier 3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, questions? Concerns?
Generally well. We're moving right along.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I do want to point out one other thing that
troubles me a little bit and it's on the page 279 in the big book. And
it's on line 38 under, apparently under the new transportation bill. If
counties chose to use some of their local money for highway purposes,
then they can get some matching money from the State under these new,
under the new highway bill we passed, but I don't like the idea on line
38 where they get a bonus. I mean why should we be telling the locals
that if you'll go ahead and impose this tax for highway purposes then
we'll give you a bonus. I just think that's a bad public policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.</p>

Ask staff do we have all the proper documentation on these two
provisions.
[speaker changes]
Yes, we were provided documentation that for the town wants to bring in
its own property so that you could see that local act and the other
town, I get them confused, it actually has a voluntary petition from a
non profit that wants to have a business part brought in in the
voluntary annexation. So, there's evidence that the town boards wanted
the bill and that the property will be the first property brought in
under the local act wants to be brought in. One is owned by the town,
the other is owned by a non profit.

Thank you Madame Chair.  A question for the bill's sponsor. Senator, on
this, one of the reasons that I was aware of that we do, that we don't,
that we tend not to do non contiguous annexations. We tend to jump over,
maybe, some of the depressed areas that need the services to get to
richer neighborhoods and those things. Is that the case on either one of
these issues? You're not jumping over anybody to get there, are you?
