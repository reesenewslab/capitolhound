<p id="00:00">
Members, if you would, please find your seats. Good morning. I am not
Representative Murry, obviously. I'm Representative Saine and I'll be
chairing today in place of Tom Murry. First of all, I'd like to
introduce our pages today. We've got Griffin Matsuo, I'll try to say
that right, from Wake County, sponsored by Kelly Hastings, Thomas Moore
III, Orange County, sponsored by Representative Verla Insko, Hadley
Nelson from Mecklenburg County, sponsored by Representative Samuelson,
Carter Noeker from New Hanover County, sponsored by Representative
Davis, Adrian Overcash from Wake County, sponsored by Representative
Wilkins and Riley Peterson from Wake County, sponsored by Representative
Stam. This is Commerce and Job Development, our House sergeant at arms
are Bill Bass, Joe Croak, Jesse Hays, Martha Parrish and Lauren Hawkins.
Thank you all. First up on the agenda, we will take up House Bill 1100,
Boost State Nature/Heritage Tourism Industry. We have a PCS. Do we have
a motion to consider the PCS, bring it before the committee? We have a
motion by Representative Elmore seconded by Representative Moore. The
PCS is before you. Representative McNeill, if you're ready to present.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee members. This is a
committee bill that came out of the LRC, Cultural and Natural Resources
Committee, which met during the interim, the off season between the two
sessions, and this bill was, received a unanimous vote within the
committee to move forward with the bill. The purpose of the bill is
exactly as it is stated, it's to boost the state nature and heritage
tourism industry, and just, oh, I'm sorry, I thought you had a question.
OK, the proposed committee substitute for House Bill 1100 would create
the Natural and Heritage Tourism Advisory Board and then direct the
Department of Commerce to hire a consultant to make recommendations
regarding the operation of the state historic and cultural sites.
Section 1 of the bill would create an independent 9 member Nature and
Heritage Tourism Advisory Board, which would be located administratively
within the Division of Tourism Film, Board, as forced development in the
Department of Commerce. The board would be authorized to make
recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce and the General Assembly on
the following, methods for increasing nature and heritage tourism to and
within the state, methods for increasing the level of private investment
in the state's nature and heritage tourism industry, identification of
nature and heritage tourism potential for state owned facilities and
assets, methods of advertizing the state's nature and tourism industry
and then improvement of interagency cooperation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? at
the appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] OK. Section 2 would appropriate $100,000 to the department to
hire a consultant to review the operation of the state historic and
cultural sites, and I'll dispense with reading the rest of it. You all
can read, so if you've got any questions, I'll be glad to entertain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative McNeill. Representative
Carney. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I raised my hand earlier
to make that motion, so if you want to recognize the gentleman from
Fayetteville, you can. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I really want to make a comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That I think this is a great bill, and I think anything that we
can do to promote tourism in this state is great, but especially with
developing this guidebook for the nature and heritage trails here. I
think it's a good bill and long overdue, so I talked to the bill sponsor
and I'll yield to the gentleman from Cumberland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think you have one more. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very quick question. So you're creating a 9 member
board. Maybe a question for staff, will they be under the ethics
guidelines like the rest of the board members, will they follow under
that, will they fall under that same guideline under that same act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, do you have an answer to that
question or staff if possible. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think he directed it
to staff, but I do not have an answer for that, so staff might. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Please.</p>

more if the board is advisory only then the State Government, at this
act, does not apply to that board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm trying to understand the purpose of this bill. Doesn't the
Department of Cultural Resources or Department of Commerce, something,
already do this stuff to promote North Carolina tourism and why are we,
it seems like a redundancy to me, to appoint another board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is a board that has, I think, 29 members on it now, I think if
you'll look in your budget, in your budget bill, page 155 there's also a
section in the budget to add two members to that board. This board
probably would have some redundant areas that they look into.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, actually Representative Speciale asked my
question. Personally, I can't see justification when we got sites that
follow under cultural resources and it's their responsibility to be
promoting these and I'm just thinking we're a layer that's not really
necessary to get the job done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I would say that the division of tourism, the Department of
Commerce, supports this bill and the North Carolina Travel and Tourism
Coalition also support this bill. And I think Mr. Gupton[??] is here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Conrad.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted some clarification on the guidebook. I thought PCS
eliminated the guidebook, is that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The PCS did eliminate the old section 2 of the guidebook, that's
correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions/commentary for the bill sponsor? We have a motion to
accept the PCS by Representative Floyd. Do I have a second? We have ??
by Representative Moore, sorry, to state the motion correctly, if
favorable this motion will go to appropriations. All those in favor
signify by saying aye. Those opposed ??. ?? the aye's have it. The aye's
do have it. Thank you, Representative McNeill. Switching the order of
business just a little bit, we have Senate Bill 614, Cancellation
Procedure Changes. Senator Brown, you're recognized to present your
bill. I'm sorry. Do we have a motion to accept the PCS? Motion by
Representative Catlin and a second by Representative Riddell. Senator
Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee. This bill has been passed through
the House Reg Reform Committee already and it's the piece that deals
with the military and, as far as it relates to the Military Affairs
Commission and Bright[??] proceedings, what the first section of the
bill does is establishes a new requirement that the state construction
office maintain accurate maps of various surrounding military
installations. Sections 2-5 amends the statute on military lands
protection to provide that the State Construction Office of Department
of Administration is the entity responsible for reviewing requests for
endorsements for the construction of tall buildings or structures rather
than the Building Code Council. And finally, the rest of the bill deals
with public records and open meetings, and the PCS provides that the
Military Affairs Commission, within the Department of Commerce, may
withhold documents and decisions, or discussions, related to base
realignment and closure for so long as the public inspection would
frustrate the purpose of the confidentiality. It also amends the open
meetings of public records law to provide that provide that public ??
are not required and disclosed information that reveals documents
related to the Federal Government's process to determine closure
realignment of military installations until a final decision has been
made by the Federal Government in that process. And the bill becomes
effective on October 1st. The reason for this is the Bright process that
is going on now is a very, very competitive process. States, South
Carolina, Texas, Virginia, all are now fighting to maintain and keep
their bases and these negotiations that our military</p>

... Affairs Commission is undertaking and decisions that we’re trying to
make to protect our bases in North Carolina are important. Other states
will go to our website and look at what we’re doing and trump us when
they have the opportunity, so it’s important that this information
doesn’t get out as far as our strategy goes on how to protect our bases.
That’s why it’s so important that we kind of keep this confidential
until some of the decisions on the federal level are made. I’ll try to
answer any questions but that’s mainly the purpose of the bill, and it’s
a little bit time-sensitive, as you can imagine. Most states are a
really a little bit ahead of us on this ?? process right now. We’re
doing a little bit of catch up, and I don’t think I’ve got to tell
anyone what the bases mean to eastern North Carolina as far as our
economy goes, and protecting those bases are important. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Representative Whitmire has a question for
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to thank you, Senator Brown, and all
of those who put the work into this. I commended it and at the
appropriate time, ready to offer a motion to approve. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any other questions. Representative Lucas, did you have a
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not a question, sir. Just a comment that
it’s vitally important that we protect the security of our military
bases and I think this is a good bill and I support it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Representative Hager, was yours for a motion?
We’ve got a motion from Representative Whitmire and seconded by
Representative Hager. All those in favor please indicate by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed, like sign. The
bill does pass. Thank you, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Moving along next, make sure that everybody
has their copies. I believe they do. We have a PCS for House Bill 1135,
and if anyone’s waiting around for House Bill 1156, Spurious Liquor
Tastings, that has been pulled by the sponsors, so you’re free to go if
that’s all you were waiting around for. I do want to mention that to
you. House Bill 1135, Business Facilities Development. We do have a PHS.
We have a motion to put the bill before us? We have a motion by
Representative Hager, seconded by Representative Whitmire. The bill is
before you. Representative Jeter. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which PCS are we looking at? Is it the version 2? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, if you’ll answer that for us please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Starnes, the item that was handed to you which
was listed as version 2, the only change from the original PCS to what
was just handed to you is there was a requirement that we put in on page
1, line 22 item 6, which was Environmental Disqualifying Events. That
was a requirement by the staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So it’s version 2 that
we’re looking at. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s version 2. That’s the only
difference between that and the full bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
for your brevity. Representative Jeter. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Brevity has
always been my strong suit, so once again I can’t tell you what a good
bill this is. I was in Town Hall, in Huntersville Town Hall on Monday,
and the Town Manager Greg Ferguson – in case he’s listening, super guy –
came up to me and said “One of the problems we have with economic
development is the building site selection, getting facilities for
businesses to come in and having ready-made opportunities to develop
sites for businesses.” Obviously a lot of our local municipalities don’t
have the money to front some of those things; this bill allows a
mechanism to do just that. I‘ll shut up and answer your questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions for the bill sponsor? Representative
Millis and then Representative Brody. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Just a
quick question for staff. Under the aspects of the bill that speaks
about a subsidized loan, could they speak to what that actually means in
terms of normal loans that will be offered to private businesses versus
this language? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff can answer that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, Greg Roney with the Research Division. It talks about
subsidized loan and it refers to that loan having these really low
interest rates, so depending on what tier the county is determines what
the interest rate is – zero, one or two percent. Then it doesn’t… If
you’re asking about competition with private lenders, the scheme of the
bill is that the Department of Commerce would have this fund, and then
the Department of Commerce would enter into as agreement with a local
government, and then the local government would actually be the entity
that loaned the money out to a business, and then the interest rate
would be…</p>

<p id="15:00">
Below market. And the exact interest rate would depend on what tier the
county is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So what I’m
hearing is that by way of this bill, local governments would have the
ability to offer a much lower loan rate, almost to the aspects of 0%.
Would this be just to local governments to actually build
infrastructure, or are we talking about actually building shell
buildings and the whole, is this only for public infrastructure or can
actually go to private business development? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Recognizing staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It would
go to developed property that would then be leased or sold to a private
business. And so the plan anticipated is that the local government would
improve a site and then, an overarching requirement in this is that the
Department of Commerce has to have sort of a state wide plan and
evaluate these different sites so that it’s supposed to be coordinated
at the state level by the Department of Commerce and then if any site is
actually selected for a subsidized loan, then that would flow through to
the local government, and then the local government would improve the
land or building, and yes shell buildings it specifically mentioned
something the subsidized loan would be approved for. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand your question differently, so let me
answer it a little differently. The loan itself goes from the state to
the municipal government, whether it be the county or city, it does not
go to the individual base, the business. It goes from government entity
to government entity which is in essence a function of the state anyway.
It is not a loan to the business in question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up, Representative Millis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. I definitely agree
with the bill sponsors’ intent about this, but I have to say from an
aspect of the role of state government, is that I’m all for this aspect
for public monies or subsidized loans for public infrastructure. But if
this is going to go to enable local governments to actually build shell
buildings to actually compete in the private market, I’ve seen local
governments actually go in, build shell buildings, hold a note for two,
three, four years and if anybody had to do that in the private sector,
that’s not being subsidized by the tax payer, they lose their rear end.
So if this was actually basically just confined to public
infrastructure, I’d be fully supportive, but if it goes outside those
bounds, even though I agree with the intent of the bill sponsor, I just
have to represent my constituents to say that I have a major problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. Representative Stam, also a
co-sponsor of the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to just make a couple
of remarks about it. In the fall of 2012 and into early 13, I met with
20 economic developers in 3 different locations around the state, with
some other representatives and senators. I think Robert Brawley was at
one of them. Bill Brawley, there were half a dozen other. Lots of things
we disagreed with. Representative Millis, you know I’m a hawk against
give-aways and tax incentives, right? This is one thing that they were
unanimous on as one of the most important things we could do for the
semi-rural and rural areas. And it’s not a big, it’s not an issue for my
district, or many of your districts. But if they don’t have anything to
show a prospect, even a place, the prospect just doesn’t come. Now once
they get them there, they can show them all the other wonderful things.
So we talked about, we looked at what we could do. The counties, the
cities are subdivisions of the State of North Carolina. The subsidized
loan is a loan to ourselves. Because there are, I don’t want to make
cities and counties upset if I say what they are, but they’re [LAUGH]
they are subdivisions of the state. What they do is this is a potential
loan to the city or county, and we have a provision in here that private
banks can also join in a loan with equal priority and the idea is that a
lot of them will if they’re not shouldering the whole thing. But unlike
all other incentives, this has a 100% callback because it’s secured by a
first lien on the property. And it has very easy repayment terms, but
you’re going to get it back. I don’t care what they talk about in ?? or
whatever. They do not have true callbacks because if the person goes
into bankruptcy you’re a general</p>

Creditor. Here the state is a secure creditor. This is what the economic
developers say they really need in the semi-rural and rural areas and in
some parts of the urban counties but not Research Triangle Park. I’d
encourage you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Stam, Representative Millis for a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam definitely, thank you for that clarification as well
as Representative Jeter and just to re-clarify my comments, I agree with
your intent whole heatedly. I understand the actual hand down between
the state and local governments. My aspect would be, I would be fully
supportive of this bill if it was constrained to public infrastructure
by way of local governments being able to put water lines in the ground
sewer lines in the ground. Again public monies for public
infrastructure, but if we’re getting into the aspects of building shell
buildings and things of that nature that actually competes with the
private sector, I have a major issue with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We would anticipate mostly that this will be pad ready rather than shell
buildings, but in some cases shell buildings. In the semi-rural, rural
areas, that’s just not an issue. You have to go to some of these places
to know what I’m talking about. They just have nothing and once you
bring in something, then other things perhaps can grow around it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more follow up, we've got a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, I represent a rural county, I’m familiar with the
shell building aspects and public infrastructure I’m all behind, but
again this is an issue and local governments are being more or less
coerced in this aspect so a lot of time it doesn't put the tax payer in
the best position. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to question a little bit deeper on the
eligible properties. Some of these properties in the rural areas
actually have to be cleaned up before they can be turned around and
built there or prepared. Does this legislation allow the municipality
once they get the money to be used for Brown Field clean up and all of
that, and then in addition to that, once they clean it up then develop
the site?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody I appreciate the question. That is predominately
why we put in version two, which is item six the Environmental
Disqualifying event, to address Brown Field issues and those type of
things. We had a situation in Huntersville where we had an old mill site
that was a Brown Field and we had to do some of those things. The goal
was and the reason why we put in item six was to address those concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your questions. Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you could, I didn't get to fully – sometimes I just don’t fully
understand some of these things that we put in here. Could you tell me,
does that mean that they can’t be used for Brown field clean up or the
item six means that they can be used for Brown Field clean up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we can have [Staph ?? 0:03:18] answer that question please, the
specificity of the law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Staph], did you hear the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I know that the definition and the discussion about environmental,
if you have an environmental violation that’s defined in this statute
then that business would not be eligible to buy or lease property from
the local government that has a subsidized loan. That’s clear. Your
question about would it be permissible purpose to do some Brown fields
clean up, would the local government do that. This part of the statute
about the eligibility of the business wouldn’t really affect that
attribute of the property. One general way to answer that is that the
Department of Commerce is supposed to do regulations to put a lot more
specificity on the statutory language. That question might be something
the Department of Commerce has to decide as an administrative decision,
it would certainly make a site to site decision as to whether that was a
good idea or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody, one thing that I would add at it, if you look on
page two, line 25, section 12, I believe that it would allow for those
purposes under that section where it says they can improve the land. So
based on your question I think the answer is yes. I would remind you at
the end of this bill, one of the things that this bill does is to task,
to figure out what exactly the guidelines are going to be for that—</p>

section, but...PCS for house bill would appropriate $50,000 to be used
to contract for the preparation of strategic business facilities
development analysis. There's some effort to clarify some of that loan.
I believe section 12 says, in essence, yes they can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Moving through, we've got many lined up for questions. In
this order, coming next three are Representative Avila, Stone, and
Hager. Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a couple of quick questions, if I may.
Is this loan amount going to be part of the debt load of the government
entity, whether it's the city or county, because I notice you
specifically prohibit the LGC reviewing it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll let Represtative Stam answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would be part of the debt of the city, but it would be balanced, of
course, by the asset. It then would become an asset, or the loan would
be an asset of the state of North Carolina, which would be fully secured
by first lein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my question is, is you stated earlier that there are divisions
of state government, why do we have to have a middle-man? Why don't we
just give the money to them straight from the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, you could just appropriate money to a lot of different citites and
counties, but then you would have a feeding frenzy here at the assembly
about whose city and county got how much money. This is to go to
commerce to have a state-wide plan of where it's most needed. It's not
needed in Northern Raleigh or in Apex, but it's needed a lot in Kinston
and Salisbury and I could name fifty other places.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Looking down at what you prohibit from taking part in this, amusements
and government buildings and entertainment, what's left?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What page is that? Hundreds of things would be left. Tell me what page
you're on. And this was a reccommendation of the developer's association
that these particular things that generate other business so much,
they're good things by themselves, but they're not manufacturing,
they're not distribution facilities. It's things that create commerce
for other people in other areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Short comment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For commentary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know several cities, right now, that are in
trouble because they've started to go into business and I was under the
impression that with the new re-org of commerce with its PPP
organization that we were going to be taking care of the entire state. I
really get nervous when I see states taking...or cities and counties
taking on this kind of responsibility when it says the local government
must repay the subsidized loan of the business leasing or purchasing
property aquired or improved by subsidized loan fails to meet
performance criteria. That somebody's going to pay if that business
fails. I think the name of that payer is tax payer. I cannot support
this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The problem is a couple things. Almost every region of this state has a
local economic development corporation or local economic development
group. At some point, in the more affluent areas, where they don't have
it, for the most part, is where the jobs are needed most. This, in
essence, helps create manufacturing, other jobs, that's why we
specifically eliminate entertainment and other things that you you
mention. The other thing is, this is not like giving a business a loan
or a tax credit. There is an asset that this is backed up by by the
land. The tax payer's not on the hook because the property itself is
securing the loan. This is not an unsecured loan from the state. This is
a secured loan with a backed asset.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up to that please, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll allow you one more follow-up then we need to move on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
An empty building with nothing going on in it isn't much of an asset for
a tax payer's point of view.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next. Representative Stone, your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to make a few brief statements real
quickly. I can understand developers wanting to support this bill. No
one builds more expensive buildings...</p>

world would come to see the building ??.We sell that building about a
year ago we took a 500,000$ loss and that diction committee one agreed
was part of E D C which us funded by the tax payers so this bill comes
before us again i understand the ?? free money or assistance money ??
expensive building the private sector eve seen.Looking int that i would
ask to not to support this bill,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Representative Stones, Representative ??,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.Chairman this is for you Mr.Chairman ??
Speaker Changes: ? you know what i mean,
Speaker Changes: sorry,
Speaker Changes: ?? you know hat i mean,
Speaker Changes: yes i do know thank you,
Speaker Changes: There is an issue about the bill that Representative ??
talked about in section 13 is the alone percentage for the ?? different
counties and i guess we are talked about ?? question i have hear and
looking at wait county at 4.7 percent ?? why do we need to have the
three percent why do we need to have the urban counties at all guess
this question,
Speaker Changes: i ll start ?? one of this number i think we like to
make in this chamber is that urban counties are all urban and the
problem with our tear county systems ?? the most popular county in the
sate and i assure you this world is some of the ?? districts here you
know i think the people think that ?? and we struggle in our county just
like the everyone else so i don't agree with the statement that urban
counties ??,
Speaker Changes: Follow,
Speaker Changes: Fund and commerce were questions what dos this money ??
where does that money come for getting  this newly created fund ,
Speaker Changes: But i,
Speaker Changes: Representative Sam,
Speaker Changes: The proportion from the ?? board ,this would his place
some other finds would not necessarily a lot of new money but what they
call us is lot of money that is available for development is not really
usable without the purpose ?? in the later years that would actually
funded,there was no money actually funded but do remember is the
commerce department that would be lending the money and not just because
the ?? money ask for if south east ?? you know had a situation they
could have a pave ready site i mean it might be in a tear you know the
hire tear county but it's a poor area,
Speaker Changes: Mr.Chairman follow ??,
Speaker Changes: ?? specially from which this money is coming from funds
you know exactly which fund,
Speaker Changes: Representative Sam ,
Speaker Changes: Appropriations will be decide by next year the
appropriations committee whether to fund that at all if it all,
Speaker Changes: Just a comment Mr.Chairman,
Speaker Changes: For commentary,
Speaker Changes: you know
Speaker Changes: Sometimes there is a two north Carolina,  there is a
urban North Carolina and rural North Carolina ,</p>

<p id="35:00">
Jeter, you know I have respect for both you guys but when I walk out my
door everyday I'm not five miles from a international airport or ten
miles from an international airport. I don't have sea mud[??] to provide
my water and sewer to the whole county. I don't have that infrastructure
Rutherford County or Graham County and that's really what unites the
rural east and the rural west even though, philosophically and
politically, we're so different. But that's really what unites us
because we're all the same on those issues. We don't have that
infrastructure of other research triangle part down the road or, look at
the buildings going up in, all around Wake County, Not just Raleigh but
Wake County. We just don't have those and I know there's only a certain
amount of money to go around when you're talking about commerce and if
you start allowing urban counties, and I think this is a way to get
around the tier system, if you start allowing urban counties to be able
to tier within themselves then basically that's what you're doing with
these loans. Then you actually take money away from tier 1 and tier 2
counties that need it the most. I sat in this morning with the DOT folks
and looked at what the STI equations going to do to rural counties. It's
not going to be positive to rural counties. Now, we got our roads, our
roads are disappearing from us, now is the commerce and the dollars to
go for economic development the next thing? That's what worries me and I
think we all, our rural folks, need to consider that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, I don't disagree with you and if, and we are happy
to eliminate the tier 3 counties and guide it towards tier 1 and tier 2
counties. We represent tier 3 counties, obviously, from Mecklenburg and
Wake. Our soul purpose, primarily is tier 1 and 2 counties. We do have
some concerns about the rural areas and tier 3 but we are happy to
eliminate tier 3 counties from consideration if that will gain support
because our goal is to create jobs in some of the areas that need it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, let me give you an update real quick on our
batting order, as I see it. Representative Warren, Representative Terry,
Representative Speciale, Representative Floyd, Representative
Bumgardner, Representative Szoka, Representative Carney, Representative
Wells-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who doesn't want to-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Graham, Representative Richardson, Representative Brown,
Representative Conrad, and Representative Alexander, okay. Anybody,
let's see, Representative Brawley, Representative Martin. The body will
suspend as well as update. Representative Hanes says why not?
Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hanes, I'm sure you'll come up with a question by the
time we get to you. Representative Hager touched on the question that I
have and for me it's just clarification. According to all the last two
PCS's you're taking $50,000 from the General Fund for the analysis on
the first section but, as I understand it then, the fund itself will be
setup from within the budget of commerce. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you tell me how much money we're talking about in that fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's talking about 15/20 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll let Representative Stam-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the eco-development board discussions we talked in with 10/15/20
million that would be re-purposed from other things in commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course that would be up to next year's Appropriation Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For follow-up, Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So we're talking anywhere, a ten million dollar spread there, 10/15/20
million dollars. You're not real sure. Can, and then you said that the
next year would be from appropriations so we're looking, actually, of
that ten or fifteen or twenty million dollars actually coming from
appropriations increasing the allocation to commerce next year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Mostly, as I said before-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I've said before, mostly from re-purposing other money that is
currently appropriated to commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't mean to belabor the point, and I apologize if I'm not picking up
on this, so the appropriation that would go to commerce next year would
be the normal increase or whatever normal increase you would have for
commerce but it would be up to commerce to pool that ten or fifteen or
twenty million dollars from within their budget? Is it, am I
understanding that correctly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, most of the money would come from other money in the commerce
and, if I'm not mistaken, commerce supports this bill. At least they've
told me many times they do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay but, one last follow-up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just, Representative Stam, just so I, I want to make sure you confirmed
for me I understand this. So the fund would be setup with monies</p>

... coming from within Commerce’s own budget based on where they would
skim it from other programs or whatever, and then you said “most of it”,
so I’m assuming then there would be some type of increase or additional
allocations next year to make this fund a little more larger. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s up to the
Appropriations Committee next year. If the Appropriations Committee next
year didn’t appropriate a dime for this, it wouldn’t be funded. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is setting up the mechanism
so that they can work on it for a year and be able to tell us next year
what they would actually do with it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Terry,
for your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you hear me? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can hear you now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
My question is… I guess I think it’s technical but I’m not sure. As I
listen to this discussion and as I try to wrap my mind around the new
Commerce Department’s system of prosperity zones, I would like to know
exactly how this relates to, in terms of formula-driven funding, the
prosperity zones compared with the tiering system. I asked earlier for
an overlay of prosperity zones in tiers so that I could understand, so
can anybody tell me how this would work there? Because I know some of
the commerce stuff is based on census track data and kind of is
formula-driven. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that they could tell you next
year more than they could tell you this year, but it’s directed to the
semirural and rural areas. That’s the emphasis. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I understood that quite clearly sir, but
the reality about how the rural and the tiering as it compares with
prosperity zones is I guess my question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think if you’re asking “How is
it going to be funded in relation to the other project?” I go back to
Representative Stam’s answer to the other items. In essence, all this
bill does is set the policy in place and the mechanism for this policy
to exist in statute. The reality is in our next budget cycle, the
appropriations, the appropriations of which many of us serve on are
going to have to decide how much money is spent and where the money
comes from and how that fits into the other items. We’re not making that
decision today. All we’re making a decision on is is this a policy that
we want to pursue, and ask part of the 50 thousand dollars just to
figure out answers to some of those specific questions on the financing
models, and then next year, for those that are fortunate enough to come
back, in appropriations we’ll make the decision of how and where it’s
funded from and to the amount. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have most
respect for both you gentlemen but I got to tell you, “if you build it,
they will come” has been tried. Global TransPark built that whole thing,
put shell buildings up, put roads in, everything else, and all it’s
done, it’s been a one armed bandit that has raped us financially for
years, for decades. There was a loan fund there to help for
infrastructure to help local governments with infrastructure, and it sat
dormant for the last two years, and if you remember, I put a bill in and
we got that money back out of that fund and gave it back to the counties
that put it in there. I’ve got a host of questions here on this bill but
I’m not going to ask them. I’m going to ask them kind of rhetorically; I
don’t expect you to answer them. How much is this going to cost overall?
When we talk about the assets protecting the investment, rarely do the
assets return that investment if they’re to be sold. We could go county
through county in this state and find shell buildings that were put up
at one point or another that turned out to be boondoggles. Guilford
County had one. They lost big dollars on that when they tried to sell
it. It’s another case of throwing money at something to see if it grows.
The state really should be…</p>

and involved in cutting back regulations, things like that. As far as
keeping pouring money into investments, you have certificate of
participation to help the counties out. Counties have a lot of options,
municipalities have options, when it comes to trying to assist business
and for the state to continue throwing money at it after we just
rearranged everything we're doing in this state, when it comes to the
economic zones and everything else, let's let that stuff play out and
see what happens. I could go on and on but I won't. I would just like to
ask everybody not to support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Speciale. Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think you bring the Global TransPark, which is a good example, Roanoke
Rapids is another good example where when the state comes in and tries
to do economic development it fails, which is exactly why this policy
bill is here because what we're trying to do is enable local governments
to use the resources of the state to make local decisions. I gave a
prime example where I think this bill makes a lot of sense. I go back to
the town of Huntersville, we had a economic parcel called the
Development Park off 115. We had one company in there, Pactiv, and we
had 15 other parcels that weren't being developed because,
predominantly, we didn't have a good road access for trucks. The town of
Huntersville made the decision to go in there and build a bridge, above
grade bridge obviously, pardon the redundancy there, and we brought in
three additional huge manufacturing companies because we fixed that
problem. Our goal here is to find a financing mechanism to allow the
local governments to make those decisions, not to make those decisions
at state level, but using the resources of the state. That being said,
we could sit here for another hour and a half and debate this. I don't
want to waste ya'lls time so I don't believe I have support for this
bill, unless I'm reading the room wrong, I've been reading my wife wrong
for 15 years so, with that being said, and I apologize for the
controversy of the bill, I'll be happy to pull the bill and talk to you
all offline. If I can get support I'll bring it back. If I can't, I
won't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, thank you. If I understand correctly you're
pulling the bill from the committee for now and we do appreciate the
lively discussion and the participation. Those wishing to start today,
on the audio, I'm sorry I do apologize. Being no other business before
the committee we do stand adjourned. Thank you.</p>
