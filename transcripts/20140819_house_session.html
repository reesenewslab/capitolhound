The House will temporarily come to order for our guests, I know no
members. Well, there's a few members on the floor and for our guests.
Both caucuses are still meeting at this time and both caucuses I believe
have requested a delay if we could start of session so we're going to
stand in recess until 11:30 am. The House will continue to be in recess
until 11:50. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will come
to order. Members, please take your seats. Visitors, please retire from
the chamber. The sergeant at arms will close the doors. Members and
visitors in the gallery, please silence all cellular phones and personal
electronic devices. The prayer will be offered by Representative Burt
Jones. Members and visitors in the gallery, please stand and please
remain standing for the pledge of allegiance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will you
pray with me. Our Father and our God, today is another day that your
have made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. You know far better than we
the challenges that we face. We pray for your divine guidance that our
actions and our words would be honoring to you. Help us to follow the
golden rule, to treat others as we would want them to treat us. Help us
to treat one another with love and respect. The Bible says that
government officials are ministers of God. Help us be true to that high
calling and let us be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one
another even as God in Christ Jesus offers forgiveness to each of us. As
each may choose to pray in their own way, I offer my prayer in the name
of my lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Speaker the

gentleman, just by way of explanation for the calendar today if I may
have the members' attention, I have Representative Pierce asked me with
all these bills on the calendar what was going on. There are three bills
on the calendar that are adjournment resolutions. The only adjournment
resolution that will be voted on will be the adjournment resolution
signing ??. There are two other resolutions that involve a November
session, the House has stated the position that we would not receive
those well, so of the three bills on the calendar, the</p>

<p id="10:00">
Will follow, should this bill pass, every county will have more
flexibility, more opportunities to meet the obligations that they have.
Part 3 of the bill, which deals with the closing fund, it’s very
important to understand and I know this, if there’s any word that’s
overused on this floor, it’s the word toolbox. But since that seems to
be the standard language that we use, I’ll stick with the program. The
Job Catalyst Fund provides the framework for assisting the state in just
filling in the gaps that may exist in our already good and extensive
toolbox. The existing tools that we have are important and they keep our
state competitive most of the time. But there are some cases in which
there might be a large manufacturing project with a large capital
investment, a large number of jobs, and JDig just doesn’t get us all the
way there. It’s important to understand that in those rare cases, it’s
important that the state have the flexibility to support local
communities in providing infrastructure for site prep, that this can
make the difference in landing jobs for the people of our state. Raising
the changes to the JDig program? Also very important. I’m advised by the
Secretary of Commerce that North Carolina has a pipeline of projects
right now representing nearly 3,000 jobs across the state, in counties
as far-flung as Brunswick, Cleveland, Wilson, Pitt, Bunkham, Guilford
and the list just goes on. All of them may not happen. That’s the way
the economic development game works. But you have to signal that you’re
in business and that you want them and that’s what this bill would do.
JDig is used in rural communities. Many of my friends from the rural
part of the state have asked me about this. This has been used to bring
jobs to Rockingham County, to Bladen, Davie, Rowan, Pander, Catawba,
Lee, Burke. This truly is a state-wide program but it’s also important
and I speak straight to my friends who like I represent a rural
district, it’s also important to understand that if a JDig award is made
in a Tier 3 county which is more of our urban counties, that 25% of that
grant goes into the industrial development fund, which funds
infrastructure in rural counties. I want to speak only briefly about the
last two parts of the bill. The part dealing with the confidentiality of
the unemployment insurance passed the House unanimously sometime ago.
This does correct a problem we discussed on the floor of the House. With
your indulgence, I will not rediscuss that. Part 7 of the bill is purely
technical changes. All of the changes contained in Part 7 of this bill
have previously passed the House and they again are purely technical
corrections to various revenue laws. Mr. Speaker I appreciate the
opportunity to explain this bill, and I look forward to the debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Chair would
like to extend a welcome and a courtesy of the gallery to a group from
Accenture. Accenture is an organization I know as a partner of Price
Waterhouse, we always considered you all a worth second-tier competitor.
But no in all seriousness, welcome and please stand and let us welcome
you. [APPLAUSE] And dependent upon the outcome of an election in
November, I may have a resume for you. [LAUGHTER] Also upon request from
Representative Speciale, the Chair would like to extend the courtesies
of the gallery to a very special young man with his grandma up to my

To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, members, this bill has a nominal cost if used as
intended of two hundred million dollars. Now some of that is in the
future and it'd be appropriate to discount it to the present worth. I
don't have the data to exactly do it but I'm going to estimate it costs
a hundred and fifty million dollars. We're supposedly voting on this in
order to fix a T A problem which has a statewide significance as
estimated by O S B M of about four million. So the senate want us to
trade a hundred fifty million for four million. Let me address the
expenditures on the- other people will be addressing the sales tax
issue, I'd like to address the expenditure part. All of us, when we go
to see our civic clubs or other political clubs, we're in favor of free
enterprise. I'd like to read you just a one sentence quote but it's a
long sentence. A statesman, that's you, who should attempt to direct
private people, that's them, in what manner they ought to employ their
capital would not only load himself with the most unnecessary attention
but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no
single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would
nowhere be as dangerous as in the hands of a
man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to
exercise it. I don't think I have the ability to decide where this
hundred and fifty million should go and I don't think commerce does
either. Oh, who said that by the way. Well that was actually written
three hundred years ago or so but is equally applicable to our vote
today. That's Adam Smith in the Wealth Of Nations for those of you who
claim to be free enterprise people. Now, let's take them one at a time.
The J Mac modification is to keep an employer here, Evergreen, which
otherwise might leave when they've already agreed to invest fifty
million dollars and they've been there for forever and natural gas is
coming. Well I feel sorry for Evergreen that EPA has harassed them with
this new rule change but they are not going anywhere. I feel sorry, I
wish we could give them twelve million dollars but it's not savnig jobs
because those jobs aren't going anywhere anyway. Let's look at JDIG.
When I mention the hundred and fifty million dollar figure, other people
say well we'll get that money back from the taxes that people pay from
their new employment. That assumes that there is new employment but
we've had study after study that shows the lack of proof that this
actually induces employment. We had a program, the ?? act, and we had U
N C look at it and they determined that ninety six percent of the jobs
for which credit was taken would have come here anyway. Four percent
were actually induced but you were paying for ninety six percent that
were not induced. That was from the economist at Chapel Hill. Take a
look at what I passed out from the ?? center, research summary twenty
fourteen. This is just one of dozens and dozens of research- people who
don't have a stake in the money to be received, the economists who study
it say this kind of stuff just does not affect the overall economic well
being of a state. It doesn't work and the reason it doesn't work is
this. When Apple or Google decided to come to North Carolina, and
blessings to the counties were they came, they paid a million dollars-
we paid a million dollars per job, for those. And I will concede that
that probably induced them to come. Paid a million dollars per job. We
got</p>

<p id="20:00">
opposed and how much we paid, but it probably did induce them. Then you
see all these announcements that come out. I saw one today in the
Insider about some new company that was coming and the amount of money
they paid per job for the state and local was so little it could not
possibly have affected the decision to locate. Well if you pay way too
much or if you pay not enough to induce than that money paid by the
state is an incredible waste of money. It is only if you are exactly on
the button, exactly the deciding factor that it actually induces
anything, but how will you ever know. I put on your desk the, a press
release from 2009 about the Dell incentives and we paid out I don't
remember about $28,000 per job something like that, is that right
Representative Lambeth, to get this over here. And supposedly we had all
these clawbacks and repayment schemes and but we didn't. We didn't. The
only way really to get a clawback on this money is to put a deed of
trust on the property so that you're a secured creditor so that you have
priority over the trustee bank in bankruptcy and other creditors. We
didn't do that, so they didn't pay everything back. In the finance
committee when we considered this catalyst fund, I suggested to the
secretary three things. One get a real clawback with security. They
didn't do that. The second thing I suggested was take tier three
counties out of this. Tier three counties don't need it. They refused to
do that, so tier three counties are gonna get most of this money. How do
I know? JDIG. That's everybody's favorite program, JDIG. 86% of it goes
to tier three counties. If you're from a tier one or tier two county and
think you're gonna get this, all this money for projects, it's not gonna
happen. They wouldn't take that. I also suggested that they reduce their
number of jobs and amount of investment by half so that two good
projects could qualify instead of one huge project. They refused to do
that. It's the same idea that it's only the huge project that produces
economic wealth and we just know that that is not true. Every economic
study, I've passed I mean, is it true Representative Wells? OK. Im
through. The final one well that's the three. They add up to $150
million. Some people say $150 million. That's the present worth, but
some of this is gonna go for 6 years or 12 years. But folks we do this
every session. It's usually the last week of a session and they try to
jam down a big giveaway to an out of state corporation and that's what
we've got here. So you've gotta add this $150 million every year and
that $150 million different people would do different things with it.
That's the present worth. Some people would use it for teacher for all
the teacher's assistants in the world. Some people would use it for
medical care. Some people would use it to fix our building. Some people
would put it in reserves, so we have a true rainy day reserve. But don't
think that this is free money that we're passing out and that somehow
we're gonna get it back from these companies because that's not why they
come here. They come here because of a calculation based on all of their
costs, all the benefits, and this catalyst fund of $20 million, is that
it? Can't possibly be enough to actually induce Continental Tire to come
to Brunswick County. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Presnell please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Evergreen I wanted to kind of explain to you, this is
1,000 jobs, 300 of which come directly from Buncombe County from
Representative Fisher's district and Representative Moffitt and
Representative Ramsey's district. They also there's 11 counties involved
that have actual employers, employees that go to the paper mill for
jobs. My district is Haywood where the paper mill is located.</p>

<p id="25:00">
People come from Madison County and Yancey County, Representative
McGrady's district, Representative Hager's district, Representative
West, his district. Representative Dobson. Representative Whitmire.
Representative Queen and Representative Jordan. These jobs are real,
real jobs. If we lose these, we are a Tier 2 county. My whole district
is, if we lose these we are going to be the poorest of the poor and it
will take 20 years to gain any kind of jobs back in that area. These
mountain people need these jobs. These are 78 thousand dollars a year
plus benefit kind of jobs. You don't find those in the mountains.
They're not just everywhere. These are very very high paying jobs. I
thought I would explain to you I went to some of the - my lager friends,
the Gilleys, and I asked them exactly how this, the Canton paper mill
affect you. And he was very adamant, he said that the small trees that
they cut, when they clear for a business or whatever's coming in, the
smaller trees are loaded and they go down to Rutherford County,
Representative Hager's district, and they are chipped and from there
they send them to the paper mill in Canton and they make the paper.
Paper cups, paper plates, regular paper. They've been there for a very
long time. They change what they're going to make sometimes but it's a
very necessary kind of a thing. This is the business that needs your
help. The EPA boiler MACT regulation straight out of Washington has told
them they have to change to natural gas. They're doing this because
they're forced to do it. This will cost them. They're putting in 50
million. They're only asking for 12.8 from the state. They need a little
bit of a boost, a little bit of a help to do that. This, for years to
come, will be 5 million dollars a year more than this company is going
to have to pay because they're being forced to go to natural gas. I'll
say one more thing, this is infrastructure. A lot of you that are in
urban areas, you already have natural gas that come to your counties. We
don't. Up in the mountains we do not. This is going to bring
infrastructure and natural gas to all the mountain counties so that we
can hook onto it eventually. We need this for that right there so that
right there will bring more manufacturing jobs once we have that natural
gas there. I certainly do hope you will help me and vote for this bill.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion. Gentlemen is recognized
to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you
everyone. It pains me to stand up and speak today and so I hope you'll
listen to what I have to say. I don't usually stand up and interrupt
others with questions, I'll wait to the end. I hope you will give me
that same courtesy. We should have been out of here 2 weeks ago when we
had a chance and that's when House leadership made a commitment to me
personally that 1224 was dead. A promise around here apparently does not
mean what it means when I give someone my word. I am not naive about the
political process but I do think when House leadership comes - [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jackson the Chair does apologize for
interrupting but just to set the proper context: the Chair is taking up
1224 under the understanding and it will be explained later that the
other 2 bills the Change of Material Provision, which I believe is the
one you were concerned with, is the only reason it's being considered.
1224 in it's current form will not be allowed to go into law without the
other 2 bills taken up today being passed. If they are not passed, this
bill will not go into law. The gentleman may proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Well my problem is with 1224 and some of you saw
me raise it in the rules and saw me approach the Chairman and speak
privately and when we came back to session, leadership came took a knee
beside my desk and told me &quot;This bill was dead&quot; and I said
&quot;All I need is your word&quot; and I was told &quot;You have
it&quot; and I said &quot;That's good enough for me, I'll sit down and
be quiet.&quot; I know it's a popular myth about Raleigh and DC
politicians. They'll say anything to get elected and never keep their
promises. But it doesn't have to be that way. We could treat each other
with respect and honesty. If I'm against your bill, I'll tell you. I
don't need to break my promises. People should honor their commitments.
When they don't, we descend into chaos. That's what we've been the last
two weeks.</p>

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, let me mention just a
couple of areas in this bill that greatly concern me. The first is as it
relates to White County, and I know that there are subsequent bills and
from the... As the Speaker alluded to a moment ago, that are supposed to
modify 1224, but let me tell you what the net effect would be for those
of us here in White County.  Currently, White County has 2% on its local
sales tax. This would put White County in the position of, if they want
to do anything about transportation over the course of the next two
years, to either have to vote for three-quarters of a cent in sales tax
in two separate votes, but three-quarters of a cent increase in sales
tax in 2016, or do a quarter in 2016 and not be able to address
transportation until 2018. Now, that is just not the fair to the now one
million citizens who live here in White County. The basic transit plan
that we have been discussing here in White County is based on buses. We
need it. We are looking at that. Our county commissioners have been
looking at that. We need that opportunity, but we don't need to have our
hand forced at local government to say &quot;Well, you've gotta do that
three-quarter cent in 2016,&quot; because if you look at what we passed
earlier, at Senate Bill 403, we would have to have the vote in that
year. And that's a scenario that we have. And so, our chamber is opposed
to this, and a host of our other leading citizens are opposed to this
here in White County, because it's simply not fair to the one million
citizens who live here, and their opportunity of local government to
have some control over their tools to make local decisions.
The other area that concerns me very greatly is this job catalyst fund,
and the term &quot;walking-around money,&quot; unfortunately, is kinda
the right term. We, for the last... At least the last 10 years that I've
been here, we have worked and actually on a bipartisan basis, in this
House, to have controls over the incentives. Now, I have not been a
purist on incentives. There are some incentives that I have voted for on
this floor, there are other incentives that I have voted against, but
one thing I can speak of, that I have been consistent on, is that we
have the appropriate controls, that we have the appropriate callback
provisions, that we pass incentives where we really know what it is that
we're gonna be doing with the money, and that we have criticized folks
on both sides of the aisle, for past governors, just to put it like
that, of having walking-around money, and how we wanted to get away from
that. This is sort of back to the future, in this provision, when the
secretary will actually come up with the guidelines. And it really
doesn't matter which secretary. We've had some very fine secretaries
from both sides of the aisle serve in that office. It's not about the
individual, it's about the principle involved, and  this is not the
right principle for committing 20 million dollars, and who knows what
amount of future money. And if this money doesn't... I mean, money
doesn't revert, it stays there, and who knows what the fund will be in
the future. And also, some of the provisions that are in there, I'm not
sure that your tier 1 counties are even gonna have projects that will be
able to access this. This is just trying to shoot for some big fish out
there, that may or may not be out there. And under a scenario whereby it
will be basically up to the Senate</p>

who gets the money, how much and who doesn't get the money. Now that is
contrary to what we've been attempting to do on a bipartisan basis for
accountability in these funds for the last 10 years and I would request
you to vote no on this conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate
the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen of the house I'm just going to speak to what I know in
Randolph County. I am, when I first came down here 8 years ago, I was
definitely against incentives but I have learned how much it has helped
Randolph County and I'm going to speak to the Jdig fund in particular
because that is what has helped us very much. A company in Minnesota
which was then known as Malt-O-Meal, a cereal company, one of the top 4
in the country, came to Randolph and looked at the store. In 2009 we had
a building that hadn't been used in 2.5 years. A Unilever, it was a
Unilever building and they had 150 jobs and it had been closed for 2.5
years. ?? Brands created 124 new jobs, they invested $124 million, they
received a $1.09 million Jdig grant from the state of North Carolina. In
2010 ?? Brands announced a major expansion where they created 80 more
jobs. They invested $136 million then. They received a $350 thousand
grant from one North Carolina fund, from the state of North Carolina
incentives. ?? Brands is now the largest taxpayer in Randolph County and
the city of Asheboro. They met and exceeded their commitment and I don't
know of any reports of what they're doing, whether this is taken away or
added but they did do what they committed to do for our county and city.
They are a great corporate citizen with us. They have donated 1 million
bowls of cereal to North Carolina food banks, they have supported the
United Way for $10 thousand a year. They support the Randolph County
Partnership for Children at their annual fundraiser, they have supported
Randolph Hospital, they support the YMCA Capital Fund, they support the
Randolph Community College Foundation and they are an active supporter
of the Asheboro Chamber and the Randolph County EDC. Over the past 20
years Randolph County and its cities have a very accountable and
successful return on investment from economic development incentives. 37
projects for new and existing industries, 2,851 jobs created,
712,115,225 in new capital investment, 16,758,383 in state incentives
promised, 14,718,289 dollars in local incentives promised, 10,309 of
these incentives used exclusively for public infrastructure and they
rebuilt 10 vacant buildings with these programs. I know this worked in
Randolph County and my taxpayer dollars are used just as your taxpayer
dollars are. They're not used for everything that we want or we need or
our family needs. I don't have any children in the public schools, I
don't have anyone in the prison system and my tax dollars are going
there and I know we promised we would do this and the state promised
they would pay for this, but our taxpayer dollars don't go for
everything that we want but this does to me, it does help our citizens
and it does create jobs and that's why we supposedly came down here, to
help our citizens and create jobs and this will create jobs, and I don't
like everything in any of the bills hardly that I vote for, but we need
to step up to the plate and do what is right for North Carolina. Thank
you. Please vote yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, the chair
would ask any member who intends to speak on the bill to turn their
light on at this time. There is 12 lights on. Any member who has his
lights on will be entitled to speak. I guess 13 with Representative Stam
requesting to speak a second time. The</p>

Washington D.C has the worst process in the nation the interesting thing
that i have heard in politics that everything i heard was ?? rank no 2 i
bet you have freed proud people today have ?? they see what we are doing
in out here North Carolina got passed two bills to get one Bill this is
not what we decide a rule that we decide to do as a general assembly the

decisions that i make today and that i because ?? are they gonna be
fairly across the state or gonna be one are or another if you look at
the transportation plan ?? money for north east Carolina to out it to
make for a state wide bucket that now my first project is 121st 20 years
away before we are gonna see transportation funding we added fair
reasons there we ?? more local vision bucket we make economic
development into order we have no plan right now to really get into
economic development do it are no infrastructure do it that hearing from

state the district level north east is not gonna be include in this plan
from 500 jobs ?? Washington ?? passport tank it's gonna be next to them
possible 800 jobs to come to ?? county we never had that employees in
our existence it's not good for the state either because when you look
for ?? most challenged counties in the state  you are making a choice
that you are gotta make some of the kind of money ?? because three types
of money that can o out to us three other reasons have supported
economic reasons like education transportation or they send us welfare

Manner across this state. Yes, I recognize that we will give a lion's
share to projects such as Evergreen, Goodyear and possibly Continental,
but that still does not address the needs of the small tier one counties
and that, therein lies my problem. These counties by and large will
still be without any economic resources or advantages and so I don't
know how we're helping them. I know that many of the folk who represent
these rural counties think that this may be a remote potential for them,
but realistically it probably is not and so until we can address
something that's concrete and specific for these rural, struggling
counties I'm going to have difficulty supporting it. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Pittman is recognized for a period not to exceed
2 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. When I talked to Senator
Rucho last year about the task reform bill I made the statement to him
that eliminating corporate income taxes would eliminate the
justification for a senate and he not only agreed with me but as I
recall he seemed to state that that was part of his motivation in that
bill, and we passed that tax reform and in it having reduced corporate
income taxes it seems to me counterintuitive now to turn around and
increase incentives programs. 1224 expands tax incentives programs and
gives the Secretary of Commerce I believe too much power without checks
and balances. It means more government intrusion in matters of private
enterprise, it means moving, I believe, more towards socialism. I
believe in smaller government which should mean keeping government
within bounds of this government responsibility and reducing the budget
wherever possible. If we can't eliminate corporate income taxes and
personal income taxes and incentives all at once, we should at least
reduce government spending by reducing incentive spending toward the
goal of eliminating them not expanding them. I also believe that the
teacher assistance fix that we need to the budget should not be held
hostage to 1224 and I don't believe in cooperating with extortion. You
know, comparing it to drug addictions, you know, some people go cold
turkey, some people need to be weaned off and it's just debatable what's
the best way to go about it but either one is better than staying
hooked. I'd like to get us off the addiction to incentives and I'd like
to do it cold turkey, but if we can't we should at least be reducing
what we're doing with incentives toward that goal of eliminating it and
not just staying hooked on it, so I ask you to vote against this bill.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady is recognized for a period not to exceed 2 minutes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the House. I
rise today just to ask you to think about a couple of things in
relevance to what we are doing. What this process has been since we came
here in the end of May. 1224 was filed by Representative Presnell and
you can look it up, on May the 27th. It was sent through the committee
process. It was a clean Evergreen bill, everybody thought it was sold on
a great project, bringing jobs in the future, and let me tell you you
can go home today no matter how this vote turns out and 110 of us can
say I voted to bring jobs to North Carolina. I voted to bring jobs to
North Carolina because we did and we sent it to the Senate, and it sat
over there, that was on June the 25th we voted on it, so it sat over
there through the month of April and it grew and it grew and it grew and
then it came back over here and then on August the 1st, we sent it to
rules. It used to be when a bill was sent to rules up here it was dead.
Well, that's no longer the case because we know we resurrected it
yesterday but on Friday a lot of us in here said, no, we're not going to
bring it back up. We've dealt with it. Now we had two choices. We were
told we were coming back to do a simple technical corrections bill for
teaching assistance. We did that in rules, clean bill, passed it out,
didn't come back to the floor.</p>

We're still having that hanging over us because the Senate says we need
twelve twenty-four. There's so many things wrong with this process. I
can not figure out why from the time twelve twenty-four was first heard
in this chamber, I never heard from the state economic development
association. I didn't hear from that chamber. i didn't hear from the
North Carolina chamber. And all of a sudden, sir, yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney. The lady's time has expired. If you want to
finish a comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I just close. That all of a
sudden, this has become more important than coal ash we may pick up, but
Medicaid. We can not afford this economic development plan if you will
just take the time to look at the trees and not the forest. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Carney. The lady's time has expired.
Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, to speak on the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is
recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. This should not be a contentious bill. This bill does things
that we all want it to do. We all want to adjourn and go home. We have a
bicameral legislature. We can not tell the people across the way what to
do and they can not tell us what to do. We have to have a meeting of the
minds. And it's not extortion for them to ask for certain things in an
adjournment and it's not extortion for us to ask certain things from the
Senate, but it takes two to tango. And that's what we're trying to do
today so we can adjourn and finish the people's business. It addresses
the teacher assistant issue. We didn't cut teacher assistants. We had a
pot of money that increased funding for teachers in the total pot of
money for teachers and teacher assistants and this allow local schools
to have the flexibility to fund teacher assistants or more teachers.
That's what my school districts want. That's what all our school
districts want and that's good for all people in this state. The North
Carolina economic development association  sent us an email today. Sent
us email previously saying they support this bill. They're not
Democrats. They're not Republicans. They think it will help us be more
competitive for jobs. My local chamber, the actual chamber of commerce.
The Henderson County Chamber of Commerce contacted us and they said,
pass this bill. We did some good things with tax reform, but we're still
competing against South Carolina, Texas, and other states that are out
gunning us on incentives. We don't have to offer the most incentives. We
have the best community college system. We have the best university. We
have the best quality of life. But, we need to be in the game and you
know whose opposed to this bill? Economic developers from those states.
And finally, I sympathize with my friends from Wake County, but we're
talking two years down the road, so the next general assembly, we can't
bind them. And so, in twenty fifteen, Wake County comprises ten percent
of the state's population. Ten percent of the members of this body and
we can come in and make a fix to address the concerns that the folks
from Wake County have suggested. So, I was contacted by Democrats from
my community. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ramsey, the gentleman has
ten seconds to wrap up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was contacted by
Republicans. This is not a partisan bill. I ask you this, please support
this bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for two minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House. House bill
twelve twenty-four is a package of several totally unrelated issues.
Very controversial issues. Each of which could have been considered on
their own merit and not at the end of the session. If you like the bill,
vote for it. If you don't, vote against it. But, I believe most people
that I've heard from think that this process is disrespectful to this
institution, disrespectful to our members, and therefore disrespectful
to the citizens of North Carolina that we are honored to represent. This
is not a partisan issue. I believe that most members from this House
representing both sides of the aisle, strongly desire the opportunity to
pass a stand alone bill to fix the concern about the teacher assistants.
This is not about whether North Carolina will use incentives or not.
We've already passed a budget that funds incentives. Ladies and
gentlemen, with all due respect, this is a sad day for this institution.
I oppose the bill and I oppose the process and I will vote no. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to point out a couple things that really we
haven't dealt with much this time around. I'll try not to repeat what
anybody said. A couple of the provisions that are actually, probably
more...[end]</p>

likable to some of the folks here. One deals with the county option
issue. We were handed a sheet that I, anytime you hand me something I am
going to read it, especially if it's filled with numbers. And this one
showed what the counties are charging, currently, as far as sales tax
goes. Now, I looked up my two counties and I did a quick count and, if I
counted correctly, 65 out of 100 counties right now are only charging a
2% sales tax which means they can go up any time they want to another
quarter cent without this provision. So 65 of the 100 counties don't
need House Bill 1224. You might look and see whether your counties are
on there, both of mine are. Second thing I'd like to point out is that I
too don't like what's going on, sometimes, with EPA and the way they're
making businesses spend a lot of money on things that really are
controversial but we've gone the other direction in North Carolina over
the last four years. We've tried to reign in regulatory hindrance of
business and so forth, so not only with this particular vision are we
being held hostage by the Senate, I'd say we're being held hostage by
federal regulators. Are we going to have to come and bail out our
companies in North Carolina every time federal regulators put extra
expense on? I'd say the folks there in Western North Carolina need to be
taking this up with their U.S. congressmen and their senators. They're
the ones that can control what the federal folks are doing and when they
get off the reservation they need to let them know that. They really do.
Third thing I'd like to point out is that Secretary Dexter has said, on
a number of occasions, that she feels like, as we get further down the
tax reform process and [??] will become less necessary, but we have
already done some tax reform. We've gone a good bit of tax reform. When
I came to this chamber four years ago the Tax Foundation ranked us 42nd
to best tax burden and now we're up to 17th. Most of our other
surrounding states were in the teens, now I see that South Carolina's
down to 37th, Georgia's down to 32nd. Surveys of corporate CEO's have
shown that things like incentives of short-term boost are a part of
their decision making process but a much smaller part than long term
profitability, which is based on your tax rates, it's based on
infrastructure-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, the gentleman's time is expired. If you want to

Okay, so I would ask that you vote against this bill. Let's take a long

this bill for a little over an hour and that is after we have spent
about ten hours in caucus preparing to debate it. But still, I'm
supposed to speak to the bill and to my own feelings about it. Well,
I'll tell you this, I am, I've been here almost ten years and for the
first time ever I am preparing to vote against the business incentives
package. But I'm not just voting against the business incentives
package, I'm voting against a poorly conceived package. Many of you have

I'll be brief as I can. I'm finishing up my first two year term up here
but I can tell you that I sat up in that balcony for the last 14 years
watching what was going on down here. I watched Frank Williams, who's
not here. I watched John Blust, I watched Leo Daughtry, I watched some
of the old folks over the years, folks that have been here. I watched
them arguing on the floor here as I looked down, arguing against this
type of thing, arguing against these walk around money bills, this type
of stuff, these incentives, and I thought, &quot;Oh, if only the
republicans could be in charge.&quot; And that's what a lot of the state
thought. If only the republicans were in charge they would fix this,
they would quit doing this. They would quit spending our money. They
would quit taking them dollars out of my pocket and giving it to someone
else.</p>

I'm going to help make things different. And I'm so glad that we're so
smarter than the folks that were here before us because we've got this

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Steve Ross is recognized for a period not to exceed 2 minutes to
debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I'm gonna give it a try.
You know since 2007, 2008, we've been going through what they've been
calling the great recession. I won't have to tell you what that did to
North Carolina and the rest of the country. We all ran, or most of us
ran on a platform of trying to create jobs. Well creating jobs means
more than lip service. I spent about 20 years in local government,
working, trying to bruing business to my community. I was actually one
of the early negotiators on the Honda aero deal. I don't have to tell
some of you what that deal did for the Piedmont tri out of North
Carolina. Not only has it brought hundreds of jobs and hunreds of
millions of dollars to the triad, but it's also brought a lot of other
aerospace industry in to piggyback on top of it. Now I don't like the
process, I don't think there's any one of us in here that like the
process of what's taking place, but I know one thing. You have to be
competitive. If you're not competitive, you're not in the game. And I've
been looking at some of the figures from some of the surrounding states,
and incidentally, all of your southern states  have this kind of
package. 37 million in South Carolina, sitting there as a closing fund.
76 million in Texas, and by the way Texas ranks number 11 in the Tax
Foundation rankings. That's a little better than us, but they still have
$76 million sitting there. What about Alabama? 131 million. Now I said
yesterday to agree with people, I said I don't want to go into a
gunfight being the only person who don't have a gun. So why do we want
North Carolina to go into job creation until our commerce department,
you know you're going to go out here and some of these  states have some
pretty good sized cannons. And you're not going to have anything to
shoot back with. I don't like incentives but until congress changes and
levels the playing field, it's a fact of life. And one last thing in
closing, in addressing the evergreen situation, and a comment that was
made earlier, that's a lot of people up there that have jobs and I don't
think there's a single person up there that has a job that cares who
owns the company. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. McElraft is recognized for a period not to exceed 2 minutes to
debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I just wanted to clarify a couple of things: One thing on the sales tax
for the counties, as a former county commissioner it's very important
that we have these new sales tax changes. And yes, I'm a 2 cent county,
and why haven't my county commissioners passed a sales tax? Because it
would have been for a general purpose. This actually will specify that
sales tax for education if you go 43a, I believe it is. So that'll be
much easier for my county commissioners then to pass it. Knowing that
the state now is giving at the 9th level nationally for education. 9th
level. But when you add in our locals, we drop down into the 40s. This
will give our counties an opportunity to raise money, to start pitching
in their fair share. We have medicaid that we took away from the
counties, and now it's time that they pitch in their fair share. This'll
give them that opportunity because they can earmark that money for
education to make it easier to pass. On incentives, quickly because I
know I only have 2 minutes, we are tying our commerce secretary's hands
behind her back, if she doesn't have the same tools, I go with the tools
in the toolbox, that other states surrounding us have. And you know
what, I've heard that it's immoral to do incentives, and I'm not for
incentives when we have all the jobs that we can have in this state</p>

When no one’s unemployed. I’m not for incentives. I’m for tax reform
that helped us and I think it will help bring more corporations here. It
already has. But right now, we’re not to a point where we can’t look and
have tax incentives to bring those other jobs in. What, how moral is it
to leave someone without a job? How moral is it? It is very moral to be
able to give someone a hand up instead of a hand out. That’s what we’re
about. Thank you. Vote for this bill please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
question before the House is the adoption of the Conference Report for
House Bill 1224. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and record
the vote. 47 having voted in the affirmative, 54 in the negative. The
motion fails. Representative Moore, please, notices and announcements.
Representative Moore, please state your purpose. Ladies and gentlemen,
just procedurally, as a result of that vote, we will not be taking up
the other bills on the calendar. We do believe there will be a
Conference Report for the Coal Ash Bill. And by procedure, that bill, by
House Procedure, House Rules, that bill would have to be held over a
day. So we’re going to confer with the Minority Caucus and determine
whether or not they would be willing, we would have a committee meeting
in the morning, I expect. It would be the only other matter before we
adjourn ?? So the question would be whether or not the minority would be
amenable to having taking that up tomorrow, so that we can adjourn ??.
Otherwise we would have to come back on Thursday for that purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry to the Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
may state his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could we recess potentially?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [LAUGH] yes sir. So you are willing to take it up
tomorrow? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??
I think you just caucused. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I had to
do it publicly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, to that end, we
will be adding Representative Moffit as a conferee and the Senate will
be so notified. So we are hopeful that we have reached a point where we
will be able to end on that positive note. I thank all the members for
the debate on this last bill. I think that’s the way this process should
work. In some ways I think it’s fitting the last measure we take up, one
of the last measures we take up before we go home. Representative Tim
Moore, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn, to reconvene on Wednesday
August 20, 2014 at 11AM, subject to ratification of bills, messages from
the Senate, committee reports, conference reports, re-referral of bills
and resolutions, appointment of conferees, introductions of bills and
resolutions, committee appointments and modifications to the calendar.

[LAUGHTER] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, House Democrats will caucus
in the morning at 10:00, one hour before session. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, as you all know there are
times that our obligations here prevent us from being where we want to
be, and that is a part of the obligation of the office. However today is
a special day for one of our members and I think it should be
acknowledged and I would like to congratulate Representative Becky
Carney on her 25th wedding anniversary today. [APPLAUSE]</p>
