<p id="00:00">
Good morning everyone. I’d like to get things started, and I’m going to
begin by thanking our pages for being here. Senator Berger has sponsored
three. Miranda Judd, Treston Farington, and Candice Brown. Thank you for
being here. And our sergeants at arms, we have Ashley Mickens, Robert
Young, Billy Fricture and Steve Wilson. This morning we have two issues
we’re going to be discussing. The first one we’re going to start with
Senate Bill 374, Public Schools Budget Flexibility Act. We’ll have
Senator Tillman, we’ll have questions and comments from the committee.
We’ll have some people from the public like to comment on. And then
after that we’ve got two, a House and a Senate Bill, back to basics,
we’re going to spend some time for discussion purposes only. So we’ll
begin with Senator Tillman but we’re going to need to have someone move
for adoption of the PCS. We’ve got Senator Robinson moves. All in favor.
Opposed. The ayes have it. The PCS is before you and Senator Tillman,
would you please explain the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I’ll be fairly brief on this common sense bill that I’ve been
asked to do for years. Now my twelfth year of hearing people want more
flexibility in the public schools. And the only leg left on this
flexibility thing, the only real one left is to take the position
allotments. And to then after they are made to the schools, to then give
you the flexibility of converting those to money and using that wherever
you need it. I don’t know if 10 kids in a classroom is better than 15 or
not, and I’ve read all kind of research that it doesn’t make any
difference until you get down to 15 or below. But what I do know is
folks, if I’m responsible as a school superintendent, for the grades of
the schools in my district, and I’ve got a finite or a shrinking pot of
money, that if I’ve got more flexibility with that money I can do what I
need to do. I don’t know what you need in school A in Duplin County, or
school B in Wake County, and I don’t know whether you ought to have 10
in this class of handicapped. You can do that now. Or whether you need
110 in a class of sixth graders with a team of 3 teachers. I’ve seen
that work beautifully with the right kids and the right schools. I don’t
know what that ideal number is and neither do you. What I do know is, if
I’ve got the flexibility to put that into computers, in materials and
staff development, staff training, I can do more with a finite or a
shrinking pot of money. I don’t need my hands tied because folks, I’m
not going to be graded on whether my school succeeds or not. I was for
40-some years. You, Madam Principle and you Mr. Superintendent, are
going to be graded on your school performance and you’re going to get an
A through an F. Now we know what you’ve been doing. With this total
flexibility, I’m going to be taking a close look and sharing this with
the Ed Oversight Committee, on what you do now that you’ve got the
flexibility you’ve told me you needed for years. For example, you
connect two a zero teachers, if you wanted to do that, and convert that
to say with benefits, let’s say it’s $100,000. It won’t be quite that
much. But let’s say it converts to $100,000. You take that $100,000 in
each school or what schools choose to do that, use it the best way you
see fit. Then we can hold you responsible even more than we are now.
This takes the cap off the class sizes and the Raleigh paper had a good
time saying that we’ll have classes with all kind of crazy numbers in
it. If you do, fine. Go ahead. Get me results and I don’t care. If you
have 30 or 13, I care less. I do care whether you made progress or not
and we’re going to grade you on that. That puts the responsibility in
the hands where it belongs. We’ve never done that. We’ve never gone that
other step. Then that gives you the whole carte blanche in your hands.
That’s why I did the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Tillman.
Senator Bryant, you have a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question and then
a comment. And the question is for Senator Tillman or for staff. I don’t
know what this reporting scheme is, schema is in the bill, the codes and
I read it but I don’t know what it really means. Can you give me some
every-day plain-people’s language on what would they be reporting when
they publish this information on the website on October 15, what would
that tell us? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have staff, yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In
plain language.</p>

Chair Chris Nordstrom, fiscal research. Program report codes, that's
essentially can think of that as like the allotments so, within the
classroom teacher allotment, how do they spend that money within the
text booked allotment, how did they spend their money, object codes,
specifically what the money was spent on. For example was the money
spent on a regular classroom teacher, was the money spent on a textbook,
was it spent on contracted service, those are examples of object codes.
[Speaker Change]
I'll follow up.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
And how will that have meaning to me? Or to Mrs. Smith, a parent trying
to understand what's happening with the school system. How will that
have meaning? Is it, will that tell us something?
[Speaker Change]
Let me take that.
[Speaker Change]
??
[Speaker Change]
We know what you did, we're gonna know what you did this year. We know
what you did last year, on your test score, on your performance. We're
gonna know what you do next year under this schema, that's a good word
you used there. Under this schema we're gonna know what you did next
year. And those test scores are gonna be plain for everybody to see, and
I'm gonna say hey, you had all this flexibility and you went from a C to
a D, your test scores dropped. Now we may need to pull this flexibility
away from you, 'cuz you don't know how to use it. We gonna have the
report card data, we're gonna be clearly able to see whether we getting
results or not. Everybody told me they wanted to do this. Democrats and
Republicans said I wish I'd would have done this a long time ago.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
I just have, when he, his answer raised another question. I didn't see
in here either one or two things which would have given me a little more
confidence. I didn't see any connection on this reporting two scores.
Like somehow tying it or it would be reported in conjunction with or
something maybe you're assuming that will happen, but I didn't see
anything in the bill that connected the two. So that accountability,
results were connected with these reports. And secondly I didn't see
anything in the bill that said this flexibility is tied to results and
consequently if no results or if less then satisfactory results some
step will be taken and who is supposed to take that step. Now I could
have missed it 'cuz I been reading a whole lot of things, I will admit.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman.
[Speaker Change]
Yes Senator Tillman.
[Speaker Change]
There's no need to tie your test scores to anything else, they will
stand for themselves and we will know whether you made progress or not.
And if the flexibility helps you make progress, and you can say I think
this helped and we will take a look at it. It does not say that you will
be punished if you don't, but let me tell you clearly they get that
impression since they're gonna have to do a report annually now. On how
they did on their test scores. So I think the hammer is there it may not
be spelled out exactly but it is there.
[Speaker Change]
One last question and a comment. Are you open Senator Tillman to some
provision that would make it clear to folks who might be renegades or
feel like they were on your good side or something and might get away
with this for multiple school calendar years, that there will be some
consequence and the state board is to monitor this. I say that because,
and I'm joining in my comment 'cuz I know I'm taking up time. But I'm
concerned about LEA's who while you are saying do it if you want to you
got carte blanche, we'll see what your results are, that's that childs
school year down the drain, they can't ever, that child except to repeat
cannot recoup that lost year of bad experimentation. So I'm just, it
would make me feel more confident if there was somebody who was gonna
take action within a certain amount of time if it appeared that this was
not working as you were anticipating.
[Speaker Change]
In that wonderful statement I did hear a question. Yes my minds always
open and I don't think I've got a good side since I've been down here,
it's been beaten up so bad, I don't think there's a good side. I'm
always open to something that will help a bill.
[Speaker Change]
And one comment on that as well. Accountability doesn't just come from
state government or the state board. You have parents, and you have
teachers in that community and that creates a lot of accountability as
well. And if you think that a school system would be failing for three
consecutive years without parents rising up I think that that would be
an assumption that would be incorrect.
[Speaker Change]
I just have one more comment that I forget. And that is in the low
wealth counties where we are, we have parents, we have accountability,
we change school boards, we have state intervention you name it, we have
it. But nothing replaces doubt, if you've got a certain amount of
dollars and you gotta run the train, there's certain things you gonna
have to do in declining resource, with declining resources and low tax
base regardless. So you don't, people feel like they don't have a lot of
choices, so we don't have unlimited possibilities, even though we have
that accountability. And I'm concerned with that kind of less than
experience over generations that this will not work well for many of us
who have continually and persistently less in terms of dollars and
resources to</p>

did contact with the villainess on four parents to be mandated we go
forward without an incumbent president of the current bill . It does to
give parents the option to opt out because some parents might choose to
a white one, someone is senator john Stenn is they might want to use
alternative ways to build the system the way and will then I think we
should be mandated parents of how they should be home page of the 200

end with the farther than the 6 to 8 weeks on the liquid is still our
current (SPEAKER CHANGES) with the current lobbies that all schools have
to give some indication or the number of different things to be able to
adjust the proportion to the school and summer middle of summer reading
And then sell them to do was still are required to make the third place

little work on a deal with changing exist and that the case with most of
the public schools act which is what ago which was currently logged as
one can make it available for those students since the first and second
edition weekend edition's and so the falcons are represented here I am a
big as chairman of the spinach question known as a way of what is the

week and are too often of the budget is the budget that we don't know
what the current budgets to be all this stuff is that this is really a
public private partnership whenever budget of good will never have
enough money to serve all the summer rejects all of this will happen
soon as the wisdom as you guessed it , compact with that this fiscal
research on that one was less sure of chrysalis and fiscal research of
the summer camps would not start full summer 2014 so was the budget for
summer camps last year of a figure was in the mail maybe not sure that
the initial goal of , for the overall hike from public schools act as

consider is to implement this bill over the pirates we feel pain C8 that
we have learned a lot about school systems in what they value and the
cuts if they've made over the last five years they've been had
significant cuts we have the data from the department of public
instruction that shows us that nine out of 10 cups happened in the
classroom and we've known that since 2009 and I've spoken to Senator
Tillman republicans democrats were all perplexed by bids were frustrated
by this ASEA we feel like we're about to give our 115 Ali eighties even
more discretion to make more cuts we have a proposal that is on the com
the governor submitted his budget eliminates 3400 teacher assistants and
all indications is that the city will follow suit in its budget proposal

further comments and questions from the seventh as soon as chairman

will make a comment that if you read the bill way out if it's not the
race and class sizes in KKR anywhere else in fact I would put my
teachers, use of my office and nine or it may be even more into a three
and then I would raise another question were untested all math science
and operating in project like I would put more teachers then I would
hope that that would relieve class also this bill does not do anything
to lower tax to raise a glass of back and do the flexibility of the

[Speaker changes.]...uh...they asked me to. To me it's common sense.  I
mean I don't...I can't imagine ya'know...reading, writing, 'rithmetic.
Another little anecdote...true story...is a lady that does a show called
&quot;Fox and Friends&quot;, which I'd never heard of...anybody ever
heard of that?  It's somethin' on TV. ???????, have you heard of that.
You have?  Yeah, I don't know what that is but she called me from New
York City and she said ...could you come up here and be on this show and
if you can't, we'll pick you up in Hickory and take you to Charlotte and
do the show...and I said, I can't I've already got plans.  But she said,
&quot;we wanna do a story on this&quot;.  And she said, are you serious
that down there, you hafta tell them to teach writing?  And I said,
&quot;I'm afraid this is true.&quot;  And she said, &quot;It sounds like
a joke.&quot;  She said, what would they say if you said, &quot;You have
to teach reading.&quot;?  Do you have to mandate that too?  She said,
&quot;Are these the schools?&quot;.  And, I said, &quot;This is a true
story.&quot;. (Laughter.)  Anyway...other than that, I don't
[INAUDIBLE.]  If it's not common sense, I don't really know why we have
a school system.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Senator ??????? Do we have any questions
or comments from the Senate?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Stein.
[Speaker changes.] Your bill specifies &quot;cursive writing&quot; as
opposed to &quot;writing&quot;, I mean I do believe our children learn
to write.  It's just that they're not learning cursive anymore.  And I
was just talking with Senator Tarte. He actually writes letters in
&quot;cursive&quot;.  The only time I have used cursive in the last
thirty years was my very poor signature...and maybe to have improved my
signature be worthy to teach cursive but I just heard twenty minutes of
Senator Tillman reminding me how we don't know anything...and we don't
know what kids should learn.  We...it's not for us to dictate who should
learn what.  And here we are dictating that we should teach something
that no one uses anymore.
[Speaker changes.] Excuse me.  I beg to differ that people don't use
cursive writing.  I beg to differ and I wanna...this is something I got
from the Supervisor of Pages. The Supervisor of Pages here wrote me and
said &quot;The Senate Pages are wonderful and our office truly
appreciates their service. Little side note: Notice how the letter is
written in print, not cursive. Daniel, a junior in high school, was not
taught how to read or write in cursive. Another buy product of not being
to write in cursive is you can't read it.&quot; So, you know, with your
fine education and your Ivy League background and your law degree, you
may not need this but, for most people, it's helpful to be able to
write.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.  I would like to let Representative
Hurley, we have a companion bill...House Bill 146.  I'd like to have her
come up and share her point of view on this bill as well.
[Speaker changes.] Thank ya'll for havin' me this morning.  I came in a
little bit different.  I got a...I had a class of fourth graders here a
coupla' years ago and they all...their teacher had me to write, had them
write me a letter..thank you letters.  This is a letter from the teacher
in cursive...and this is a letter from the children and they all
printed...printed their names and everything and I really appreciate it.
 But I started askin' fourth graders...they don't know how to write
because to me, when I get printing, I think their haven't learned how to
write.  And so, I started askin'...and, at our Rotary meeting, we had
the superintendent of our city schools...we have city and county
schools...and we had the superintendent there as well as the chairman of
the city school board and they gave us time for questions and I said
&quot;Is it true that we are not teaching our children to write cursive
anymore?&quot;. And the superintendent of the..the School Board Chair
said &quot;I am gonna defer to the superintendent.&quot;  And she said,
well yes and no. They give the teachers the decision to teach or not
teach so many of our students in North Carolina are not learning...of
the 115 systems that we have, we heard back from 65, we heard from three
more...two do not teach it at all, two counties do not teach it at all.
Some teach...let teachers decide whether they will or not. Some teach it
off and on. So the reason I decided to do this bill is because I feel
that every student, every child in North Carolina needs this
opportunity...because they cannot read it.  Most of the time if you
cannot write it, you cannot read it and I think all of you know that....</p>

job if we couldn't read cursive. We've had this opportunity and I think
it's very important that we give other students the opportunity. And the
special needs children and the children that need the extra help,
there's help there for that. To be honest there's no problem with doing
this. It can fit right into our curriculum. There's no cost to this.
It's just important and it helps the self-esteem. It helps the child
period. The children I asked this morning, the one was not taught it,
the other two were. They said they weren't really good at it. Our pages
that I asked this morning. And I talked to the charter school, they are
still teaching it. So are Christian schools, so are private schools.
They are still teaching it. I've had all kinds of people. I've had BBC
come and talk to me the other day and they did an interview. And I've
had different ones to call-- to come in and take different comments.
I've had NNO wrote, believe this or not, but the NNO wrote that this
should pass. That our students need to learn cursive writing. Supposedly
it helps brain activity, it helps hand eye contact, and I've got no
really negative except it's not really used because of the digital age.
And I've got no real problem with that, but I feel that it's very
important they they use this skill to be able to succeed at life. In our
news paper office, a lady brought in a note, she wanted to put
information in the newspaper, an announcement. The girl who took it in
at the counter could not read it. Even though she was home school she
could not read it. Had to take it to someone else to translate. We don't
need cursive to become a foreign language also. I'll be glad to answer
any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Ross.. Chairman Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I've got to clear up Senator Stein's
erroneous statement. I didn't say we don't care what you teach. I just
say we don't care how you spend the money. Representative Hurley the NNO
endorsed it, and I'm afraid this bills in trouble now. I'm still going
to vote for it. And thank you, you and senator Allran have both done a
lot of work and I appreciate that and I do care what we teach.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It's for discussion only today, but I do
have a couple of questions here. I'm going to let Senator Peet please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. And either Rep Hurley or
Senator Allran can answer this. I see in the bill summary it also talks
about multiplication tables, and I wonder if either of them has any
comment on the school system apparently not requiring the memorization
of the multiplication tables.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Alrand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate, the only thing I can say is if they
schools don't teach reading, writing and arithmetic, what are they for
other than some type of socialization. If we're socializing the students
but not teaching them really anything, they're not going to be smart
enough, intelligent enough to read anything, write anything, to think,
to know if they're being socialized well or not socialized well. That's
very dangerous. I mean reading, writing and arithmetic. You can't do
arithmetic if you don't know the multiplication tables. It's not
possible. That's why they can't divide, they can't make change when they
work at the stores without using a machine. That's not teaching people
to think for themselves. That's letting machines think for people and
other people think for people. That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rayburn, did you have a question as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well more like a comment because I can't resist. Even
with regard to Senator Pate sitting next to me I've probably seen more
history than anyone in this room and I have absolutely abhorred that
this discussion, or debate, is even necessary. When we start putting
down discipline, when we start putting down the responsibility to learn,
when we don't demand that students do what they're supposed to do, we
are on a downward path toward oblivion. We will be like the Roman
Empire, gone. This debate should be absolutely not even considered. This
discipline of cursive writing, how will our children ever learn from the
Constitution if they can't read it. This is silly. The bill shouldn't
even be needed if the education system were working properly. Sorry I
got emotional, but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll let Representative</p>

Representative Shepard to make a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate Representative Hurley to be a part of
this. I think we all agree that digital learning and technology is very
important for our school system, but I don’t think we need to leave
behind some of the very important elementary and basics of education
that we also talked about today, arithmetic, multiplication tables and
writing. I’m going to share just one brief story, as Chair of a
Committee, Joint Committee with the Senate and the House and
Appropriations. A couple of weeks ago I was given a sheet with all the
pages name listed on there, they were not written in cursive they were
printed. I could not read 2 of the 3, I had to go through the pages and
say, “What is your name?” because I couldn’t read those. So, I do think
that should even say to us we should emphasis even more that cursive is
very important and the basics. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We do have a few questions, let me run through them.
We’re going to go to Senator Robinson, Barringer and Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I have question then a comment
because part of the summers where I have kept my grand-daughter has been
about, has to read so many books, has to do reports, written reports and
then has to do multiplication tables, so, that has grown up and I’m an
old grandma too. The question I have for staff is, on the SAT and the
PSAT, the writing section is that cursive or print or is it flexible?
How is that being done now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, on that ACT North Carolina has
chosen to include the writing sub-test, students do not have to write in
cursive on the sub-test, but many choose to because they feel that it is
a faster way to respond because it is a time test.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The only comment I have, I think while I’m more
concerned about the reading and being able to put that back into words,
whether it’s cursive, print or whatever, I’m more concerned about the
funding and the support. The question I do have, is this going to be a
requirement for teachers in terms of some kind of testing  or something?
It’s not going to be a part of the requirement that we’re implementing,
is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is left up to DPI, they will between kindergarten
and 5th grade. They will be deciding when it will be taught and how it
will be done, they’ll have know how to teach it and know whether the
child is learning it or not.  DPI supports this. May I speak to the
[numeralization]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me go through the Senator’s question. Senator
Binder do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually it’s a comment. Should I hold it, or may I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This relates really to Senator Pate had raised the
question about the math and the multiplication tables. I think it’s
critical because I think it’s important the brain development. Its good
gymnastic but it’s also, I’m a big consumer advocate and I’ve taken my
children into stores and there 40% off sales, the 30% off sales and I
was appalled because there was a calculator lying there and I thought
who left that behind and I looked in the stores had laid calculators at
the tables so that people could pick them up and figure out what 30% was
and 20% off was or whatever. I’m not sure that the people didn’t know
the multiplication table or whether they could have actually done that
on the calculator anyway, to do a decimal. The point is that it’s
important for consumer protection, for the daily skill in life to know
how to buy things and all of that, like counting change and all. I think
the multiplication tables, be able to use those and the decimals and all
the basics are very important, because we’re not always going to have a
cell phone in our pocket.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You just said what I was thinking pretty much. I’ll
relate another comment though. My wife tutors students after school and
she is always just amazed at that these elementary school students
haven’t got a clue, 2 times 2, I mean it’s sad. In fact I can relate
this, I used to teach adult literacy and some of these people, adults,
in fact I remember one woman who had a child, who would stay away from</p>

sales because she did not understand, what 30 percent off meant we have
to do better were taking a step in the right direction. We have a
comment from senator barefoot now ill have representative Hurley from a
final announcement. ugh just a question to any of the bill sponsors. for
the teachers or la's shows not to teach cursive writing in the
classroom. Did you run across what you were replacing it with that time.
We do not know who was and who wasn't teaching it. we don't know who
were getting left out or ones who did learn. but i couldn't get i did
call the county schools and do a little survey for me and they had them
right in cursive with 5th graders and some not could not capitalize, and
out of these 15 wrote in cursive. The other printed so this was my
little test i didn't know who they were. They had to sign in student so
i could not know who they were the teachers who were or were not. Thank
you and lets conclude this in one more final comment and lets conclude
with that. I was just going to thank you Mr. chair man i was just going
to do the cursive writing i didn't think about the multiplication, and
was asked to do that because somehow. are they being taught with
fingers, by nines. I don't know how to do it and i was just wondering if
any of you will be able to do it. Because i want to think what there
doing. I don't know maybe someone out there does, but the children do
someone said they were doing tests out there and the classroom was full.
One girl was so fluent in doing that that everyone stopped and watched
her do it. i can imagine something about nines if you do this or do one
down. whatever it mean something else. memorizing you got that with you
always. it can go down but you ave your memory with you most of the
time. and i would ask your support when we vote on this. thank you for
the discussion on that that is all we have for today. The meeting is
adjourned</p>
