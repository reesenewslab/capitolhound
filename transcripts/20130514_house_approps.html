Committee will come to order. Members will take their seats, and the
folks in the audience will take any conversations outside. We would
appreciate it. We want to welcome today four of our pages, and if you
would raise your hand when we call out your name.
Kaylen Bell from Forsyth County, who is sponsored by Representative
Bell, is with us.
Sadie Forsyth from Mecklenburg County, sponsored by Representative
Schaffer.
Carolyn Fry from Johnston County, sponsored by Representative Daughtry.
And Mary Hannah from Lee County, sponsored by Representative Stone.
We have with us as our Sergeant at Arms today Carlton Adams, Bob ??,
Yung Bay, Joe Crook, and Antoine Marshall.
First bill we will take up on the calendar is House Bill 27, Worker's
Compensation Fund, Worker's Compensation Allocation, and Representative
Howard is recognized to present the bill, and is this a PCS?
Representative Torbett moves that the PCS be properly before the
committee without objection. Representative Howard is recognized to
explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I will just quickly
say that I hope that appropriations will treat the finance side kindly.
This PCS is very important for the firemen across the State. We're doing
an adjustment on the Worker's Compensation fund. It does not generate or
require any new money. It's just the way that the money is distributed.
It will fix the problem, and I'll be glad to go through the entire
explanation, but it basically dedicates up to 20% of the proceeds to the
Worker's Compensation for the benefit of the volunteer safety workers,
and we are reducing from 30% to 25% the amount of the net proceeds that
is remitted to the volunteer fire department fund. It reduces from 25 to
20 the amount of the net proceeds that is credited to the department of
insurance for the disbursement to the county fire districts, and the
remaining 35% between the amount remitted to the Worker's Compensation
fund and the 20% cap would be remitted to the general fund as always.
The second major change - there's a reduction from 10% to 1% the amount
that is retained by the department of insurance for the administration
of the volunteer fire department fund, and with that Mr. Chairman, I'll
stand to answer any questions, and would ask for members to support the
PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And to clarify, this is not a PCS, so you should have the bill before
you. Representative Avila is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to just make sure I have the right copy. She mentioned a lot of
changes that I don't see underlined in the copy that I've got, if I'm
looking at the right bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
PCS has not been passed out. We'll have to displace it and come back. We
will temporarily displace the bill, and will come back to it when the
copies are made of the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just like to denote for representative Howard, this does not mean that
we're not being nice to you, we're just -
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I trust you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next bill on calendar should be passed out to you, you should have it.
House Bill 157</p>

Speaker: Representative Jeeder, limited highway fund credit balance. I
believe this is a PCS. The bill should be in your stack. The gentleman
is recognized.
Representative: This is a bill that limits the use of the highway fund
outside of the budget process. It does nothing that has to do with the
direct budget. The original intent of the law, as it was established
years ago, gave the governor flexibility to allocate funds out of the
highway fund if highway 12 washed out  over on the coast, if there was a
rock slide on highway 40, if there was a sink hole that had a road cave
in. This gave the governor the ability to fix those problems. Over time
it has been used in other ways that had nothing to do with roads and
infrastructure. This, for all intent purposes, all it really does is, if
you look on page 1, line 14, it changes the current language of, “other
urgent needs,” which has meant anything in the world, to, “other urgent
road construction and road maintenance needs.” Happy to answer any
questions. Happy to talk all day.
Speaker: Representative Cleveland, you are recognized.
Representative: For a motion.
Speaker: If you will hold that for a moment. Any questions or comments
from the committee. If not, Representative Cleveland, you are recognized
for your motion.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Favorable report on the proposed
committee substitute to house bill 157, unfavorable to the original.
Speaker: I do not believe this is a PCS, is it? Okay. You have heard the
motion. All those in favor, signify by saying aye [aye], opposed, say
nay [silence]. Bill is agreed to, thank you. Next we will call up house
bill 844, modern state human resources management. Representative
Collins is recognized. There is a PCS. I think they made the copies and
got the PCS passed out. We will hold on that for just a moment
Representative Collins. Next bill we will take up is house bill 691,
limit soldiers community college tuition. You should have that one. The
PCS should be at your desk. The PCS is not? There is no PCS for this
bill.
The gentleman is recognized to present the bill.
Representative: Thank you MR. Chairman. The bill summary on this
explains exactly what this bill does. This addresses the issue of
soldiers, marines, that start their community college education in NC,
and will transfer to some other place. Often, they are in wartime status
and will be deployed over seas, and will not be allowed to continue that
because they are in a war zone. They come back to the U.S. and they are
not in NC. They want to continue their education in NC, and are charged
the out of pocket tuition rate, which is fine. The department of defense
will reimburse them for $250 rather than credit rate of $262. What this
bill simply does is say that for those soldiers, marines, airmen: any
service member that fits in that category and wants to complete their
community college degree online with the state of NC, then we will
forgive that $10 or $12 differential. There is a fiscal [xx], you can
pull it up on your computers. This is really an opportunity cost. If

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed no.  And the bill is agreed to; thank you.  Committee will be at

Bill 560.  Economical School Bus Replacement Criteria.  Representative
Arp will be recognized to explain the bill.  This bill is before the
committee for discussion purposes only at this time, and Representative
Arp is recognized to present his bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  What this bill does is simply changes
the way we procure school buses.  Before, there was no defined terms.
DPI used a system of good criteria, but it was mainly just funded as a
line item, and there was really no criteria in the budget that was
established to do this.  What we did was we looked at a couple of
different ways- we worked with DPI in developing this, and this is a
tiered approach in the sense that, what it says is a bus is eligible for
replacement when it's 20 years old or has 250,000 miles, but it has two
exceptions.  A bus less than 150,000 miles must remain in service until
it's at</p>

Representative Torbett moves that the PCS be before the committee for
discussion purposes. Without objection. Representative West is
recognized for a motion.

I move that we give the proposed committee substitute for House Bill 27
a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion and debate. Hearing none, all those in favor of motion please
signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed no. And the motion is agreed to. Next bill we’ll take up is
House bill 834, modern state human resources management. You should have
the PCS in front of you for this. And Representative Shepard moves that
it be before the committee for discussion purposes without objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, could you identify the bill we’re on again please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is House bill 834, modern state human resources management.
Representative Collins is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll go through this as quickly as possible. This is a long bill. We’ve
been working on it for a long time, meeting with all of the stakeholder
groups for a long time. But I think I can make the major changes in this
fairly easy to understand. If you look on page one, for official
purposes of the OSP, the Office of State Personnel is no longer going to
be classified under the department of the administration, it’ll report
straight to the Governor. Functionally they’ve been doing this already.
This is more an official matter than anything else. Under section 1.2,
on about line 26, the whole reason that our director Neil Alexander
wants this bill is so that he can improve HR at all levels. And so the
line here just asks things like they want to improve human relations up
and down the food chain so to speak, performance management and so
forth, to make the job environment as friendly as possible. If you look
on page 2, the change on line five is that every year state employees
will have at least 12 holidays. It used to be either 11 or 12 depending
on when Christmas fell. Again our new personnel director felt like it
shouldn’t matter when Christmas falls, should get the same number of
guaranteed holidays each year. So there’s that change. Part 2 deals with
state personnel commission. There’s two slight changes here as far as
qualification and so forth. There are still four public employees on
this commission as there have been. These changes are minor. On page
four, under part 3, career status has been shortened and has been made
consistent to 12 months. As I understand it, and some of you probably
understand this better than I do, some things used to vest in 12 months,
some in 24, some in 60. Now basically you’re a career employee at the
end of 12 months. Section 4 we’re raising the number of exempt positions
from 1,000 to 1,500 and adding three offices which in the past could not
have any exempt employees and those are on page 5. The office of
information technology, the office of state management and budget, the
office of state personnel itself. We’ll have an amendment in just a
minute on section 4.5. Down at the bottom of page 5 is where we made a
change since we presented this bill to state personnel last week. I
promised I would work on this, to our state employees association. We
did it and got the change that they wanted which changes it back to your
riff rights, basically you have unless you accept or reject a job of
equal or higher pay. The bill before us said it could happen even if you
were offered a job of lower pay, but we struck that and took it back to
what it is today. On page 6, this explains the grievance process. It’s
kind of long and involved, we made a concession here also, seeing that
originally the department wanted to stay inside the state personnel
office and state personnel commission, no for control as much as for
timing because right now it’s taking a very long time to get these
things heard. We’re hearing as much as 450 days, and all state personnel
want to streamline this process. We did bring OAH back in at the request
of the state employees association. The way it works basically right now
is you state your problem to your supervisor, if you don’t get any
satisfaction there line 15 and 16, you grieve it to your agency, if you
don’t get any satisfaction there, line 19 you grieve it to the state
personnel commission. A hearing officer is appointed by the office of
state personnel. That hearing officer makes a report within 60 days and
a recommendation to the state personnel office. Line 28, if the state
personnel commission, they can do whatever they want too. Accept,
reject, or modify what the hearing officer has said. They can issue
their own findings. Line 30, the state personnel commission is subject
to review by the office of administrative hearings. They have 60 days to
either reverse or affirm the decision that has been made there. In line
39, if you don’t like what you got from the office of…</p>

not paying the personal income tax, so i really hope that we can do like
we did last session. this is basically a bill that passed unannimously
on the senete. i think maybe  or 6 people voted against it in the house.
we want to give everybody the oppertuneity to have the high quality
education regardless of their income bracket espeisully kids with
speacial needs. i think its been demostrated at time and time again
about how about how important it is that we make sure that their
adequate environment and this bill does that and i would apprieciate the
support of the commttee
[speaker change]  very briefly, in the last 2 committee it's been an
education and finance and all of the discussion have been on the
underline law rather then the new law. the new law is as it says just
making this available to lower income parents. however i am for your
information i am working with  ??? ???. on a slight amendment regaurding
accountability to make sure that the state education assistance athority
recieves documentation that the child is actually recieving special
education related services. since we are in appropriations ill address
that very briefly this will adverage about three million dollars a year
according to the physical note, and it will not of course go into effect
under ???? c until the main budget bill passes, in other words you'll
get another swipe at it on the budget itself. but this is the policy
piece. we'll be glad to answer questions
[speaker change]  representative gram is very good to us for question,
?? or comment thank ms chair for a comment[speaker change] as a special
educator and a special education direct formal special direct us poor,
this policy i support that because i had a number of oppertunities to
talk to parent with special needs and one is something more in terms as
an option for them to have their child's needs met as a special needs
students. the state department does a great job with providing services
for these children an excellent job provide excellent oppertunities. i
do now there are children out there and certian situations that requires
something spiecial. and obviously we have special education. there are
schools out there who have the desires the needs and the resources to
provide services to special needs students in a private setting. i've
experienced those, i've had experiences with those facilities that
wanted to extend there hand out to those students. this policy gives
thse parents an option to pursue that. as a utilateral decision it's not
an I.E.P. that's a parent decision, and with that in mind i do support
this legislation, thank you.
[speaker change] that you representative michele is reconized
[speaker change] yeah i question ms chairman of somebody. the last time
we discuss this bill in education, i found out this was a refundable
ammount of money is it still in that posture?
[speaker change] this is a grant, so it's no longer attached credit so
the term refundable is not relevent. but it is, you do not have to be
wealthy to get. this this is available to every child who is what we
used to call handy cap and now disabled. who has an I.E.P.
[speaker change] representative insco
[speaker change] thank you mister chairman ladies and gentle man of the
committee. 3 thousand dollars per semester does not come close to
covering the expenses for special education child who needs extra help.
those of you who are in this committee have to have people in your
family or your nieghbors, or chidren that you know who have attended
schools that do a good job that have the staff and the class of 4 or 5
to one per teacher in order to meet the needs of these special education
children, that tuition will be at least 10 thousand dollars per semester
sometimes more 3 thousand dollars a semester does not come close to
helping a poor family meet the needs of these children and i can'nt vote
for these bills. they just are not accomplishing what there supposed to
be accomplishing in there taking money away from</p>

of the public system, the public system is underfunded we need to be
pouring more money into the public system so that every child who has a
special need would have access to the services, not just the families
that can afford to supplement a $3000 per semester scholarship with
their own funds. So I would, I, we need to do it right and I'm, I hope

Representative Horn is recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just understand the fiscal impact here, we're
moving from one system to another, from a credit to a voucher, lack of a
better term. What's the net transfer of money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Uh the net yes, in the next fiscal year 3.7 million, in the 2nd year of
the buy-in 2.8 million and in the subsequent years it averages about 2.3
million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just follow up, just so I understand, that's above what we're presently
spending, on the current children with disabilities program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna hand you the fiscal note that's
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I'm looking at it online I'm just trying to ensure that I and
everyone else here understands.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, I have a question about the grant process. Is it a
simple process or is it difficult? And also what if they don't have
internet access?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well they don't have to have internet access, it's fairly simple. It's
on page 2 it's done by the state education assistance authority, which
has been in existence for decades. With regard to college grants and
loans the SEAA will take a 2% administrative fee, and then in the first
year they get a little extra to gear up for it because they will have
SEAA will have cost in examining the receipts and the documentation to
make sure the children are actually receiving the special services but
it's first come first serve unless you were already in it the prior year
and you have to have an IEP that you receive in the public schools. So
the public school is the gatekeeper for eligibility and then every 3
years, you have to be reevaluate… the child has to be reevaluated in the
public school, but that expense is covered in this bill, to make sure
they are still qualified to receive the grant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative  Richardson  is recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I have a question on line on page 2, line 12, it says that the
eligible student awarded grants may not be enrolled in public school,
and then when we move down to line 26 that they have to be reevaluated
by the local education agency. Is that the school where they would have
gone and is there any additional money being given to that school, to
bring that child back to have them reevaluated?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The money for that is in the bill in the fiscal note through DPI. I
don't know that it has to be at the exact school but the money is
covered in the appropriations so it doesn't come out of the budget of
that particular school. But they have to return for the purpose of
revaluation, through the public school system, for just that
revaluation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So who would be responsible for transporting the student to the school,
for the evaluation? I'm over here. Over here, over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, I'm sorry. Never could find you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's ok. So who would be responsible for transporting the student back
to the school or how where would the child be tested, in the school, at
home, or where?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the parent would take them to the school, or wherever the school
directs, they'd be taken, that's..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have a question or a clarification from the
bill sponsor. They way I understand this, under current law, those with
enough taxable income already receive this benefit, all this does is
expands it to those who are not, who do not have enough income to
receive it, so that might be helpful to representative Insko, it does
not…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, you hit the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, thank you very much.</p>

So this is just to prevent double dipping beaus if they’re already being
paid for by the county they don’t get an extra six thousand dollars a
year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Yes sir. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]I appreciate the effort here I just have one question. If we’re
trying to change the current status by allowing lower economic status
families the opportunity to get this scholarship why we are then still
giving priority to the folks that had the scholarship last time? Why
wouldn’t everybody enter the pot equally starting here forward? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Baskerville I appreciate your question. The
reason is that if your child is already in the program for continuity
purposes we don’t want to take them out of the program they’re already
in the school, they’re already learning we don’t want to say hey sorry
you don’t get it this year and then they have to go back to another
school. Just for continuity purposes, if you’re in it you’re in it and
you’re grandfathered in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman I wanted to ask
about two scenarios to clarify for myself that I understand how this
would work. Let me ask either the bill sponsors or staff. Let’s say
we’re dealing with a third grader who is involved in public school and
is in special-ed and otherwise meets the eligibility requirements. He’s
been there. As I understand it, that student would be eligible for this
three thousand dollar per semester grant that would allow him to
withdraw from the public school and go to a non-public school assuming
that is what occurs, would LEA losing him to the non-public school not
have its AVM reduced by that one slot so that the LEA would receive
fewer dollars from the state since it would have fewer students. And
would that dollar amount that the LEA lost not exceed the six thousand
dollar annual cost of the grant. [SPEAKER CHANGES]They would lose the
cost as well as the resource but as I understand it unless you’ve
exceeded the twelve percent cap on special need kids the extra amount is
like net three thousand a year so in the scenarios I've seen in fiscal
notes for the underlying program. For every child who does this there is
a saving to the state so I don’t see how the state loses on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well that’s I think my point Representative Stam, as I
understand the way this is going to work the six thousand dollars is
less than the money that the state will save for each student
withdrawing from the public school and going to the non-public school
where we would be spending less money is that not correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That’s correct but some children can come in at kindergarten or
for first grade and perhaps they would have gone to the private school
anyway so there’s a balancing of costs and expenses but under the. I’m
sorry.[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s alright. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Final follow
up if I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Brief follow up yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And that was my second scenario I wanted to ask about with the
exception of what those children who might otherwise have gone to
private school anyway there also would be a savings to the state for
each of these kindergartners entering into a nonpublic school that we
would not need to fund at the LEA level. Is that not correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]That’s correct although to balance that there are some
kindergartners, first graders who might have gone to private school
anyway so they basically balance but not exactly. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative McElraft is recognized for a brief comment or
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Brief. I would just like to say I think its
very sad that we would actually think about not doing this for the
poorest of our poor and giving them opportunity. Who’s to say that
there’s not some business out there that would supplement that three
thousand dollars. Who’s to say that that school might find</p>

Another scholarship to help. Why not give them the opportunity. I've
seen people in my district that are frustrated with the way they are
being treated in some of the school systems. Their children, they don't
feel are getting the proper care that they need for that special
disability, so if there is a school that they would get better care, why
not give them the opportunity. The same as someone who can afford to pay
for it themselves. I think that we should be ashamed of ourselves if we
don't give it to the poorest of the poor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All right. We are running down on our time, because we have to be out of
here by 10 til. I believe Representative James Graham has a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman. I'd just like to ask one question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, lets take the motion and then we'll have further discussion,
further debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Just one question . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Oh, you have a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To Representative Stan. Representative Stan, is there anything in this
bill that eliminates the responsibility for the public school system to
pay for that tuition once that child enrolls in a private school?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I was informed by staff that that's automatic. We don't specifically say
it, but thats my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
A motion, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I move for a favorable to the PCS for House Bill 269, unfavorable to the
original.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
You've heard the motion for favorable report to the proposed committee
substitute for House Bill 269, for the committee substitute House Bill
269 unfavorable as to the original. Further discussion, further debate?
Representative Richardson, actually had her hand up for a very brief
comment or question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I just wanted to know, is there anything in this bill that a parent
would waive his or her right to a free appropriate education as mandated
by IDEA?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If one of the sponsors would answer that, briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No. They could come back in the next day.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
What do you mean come back .  . . Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We don't have time, I want to get to Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I will just say, with further debate and opportunity, I will ask more
questions about accountability so that we know that these children are
actually getting the education they need in a school they attend. But,
my question is would the bill sponsors accept an amendment for this to
be merit based to people who are at the 300% of the federal poverty or
lower? Would you accept that amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
That discussion can be held with the bill sponsors after the committee.
We have a motion for a favorable report, for the proposed committee
substitute before the committee. All those in favor of the motion,
please indicate by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The ayes have it and the motion is agreed to. And, we will be back in
here, probably, a little after 5:00 this afternoon to finish the balance
of our bills and partake of a couple more.</p>
