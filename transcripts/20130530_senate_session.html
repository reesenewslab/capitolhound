Bless each senator to my left and right. Bless each staff member. Bless
their families.  Send fresh seasoning to each committee meeting.  Open

Senator Barefoot for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege. Out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot you have the floor for a point of personal privilege
out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate today I would like to recognize an 11 year old
fifth grader from my district who I think is a hero. His name is Jacob
James. A few weeks ago, during school lunch, Jacob's best friend Marty
Hall Jr. known by his classmates as MJ, bit off more than his sandwich
than he could chew. MJ started to choke. As the lunch because lodged in
his throat. The children around him began to panic, unsure of what to
do. So MJ quickly tapped his best friend Jacob on the shoulder for help.
Just a week before Jacob had learned how to do the Heimlich Maneuver in
the Boy Scouts. So Jacob turned to MJ, gave him a few thrusts to the
stomach, and saved his best friend's life. Jacob has taken on the role
of hero status in his community of Bern, and has even been featured on
WREL TV news. I think Jacob's story is a real life example that
demonstrates the Boy Scout motto &quot;Be Prepared&quot; and today Jacob
is here with us and is accompanied by his family Chris and Stephanie
Baker, his two siblings Luke and Danika, and his brother Domenic is at
school studying for the E.A.G.s. Would you please join me in
congratulating Jacob for being prepared and saving his best friend's
life [applause].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Make an observation. I notice that even the birds are trying to get in
the window to see Jacob. I think that was remarkable,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator Barefoot. We'll move right in to
the calendar ?? starting with local Bills second reading role call bill
House Bill 671, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Senate is the passage of Committee Substitute to House Bill 671 on its

case, since regarding student data.instead, North Carolina, last
session, we created a longitudinal data board requiring state agencies
this year student information and workforce data to improve state
educational system. this bill makes changes to address some of technical
issues in the bill. it designates the state chief information officers,
the chairman of the board and requires the board to report quarterly
rather than annually to the General assembly, and it solves some
constitutional issues with members of the legislature who were
critically allowed seven hundred and now no longer will be able to come
