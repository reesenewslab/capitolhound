Representative: …the implication that this has for your cities, and,
join with me in opposing this bill. And, Mr. Speaker, to be recognized
to send forth an amendment?
Speaker: The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read.
Clerk: Representative Fisher moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 15,
by deleting that line and substituting the following
Speaker: The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
Representative:  Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, this
amendment will actually, if the bill passes, it will make the bill
conform to the way the statue was previously. Before this bill, that we
are looking at now – according to the old statute, there was a
requirement that said that there must be appointed a member from the
county to the planning and zoning board and to the board of adjustment
to work in concert with the city to formulate zoning rules. Once this –
if this bill passes, then there will no longer be that need, as the
previous statute required, for their to be a county appointment to the
city planning and zoning board, or to the city board of adjustment,
because no longer will the city have a say over what happens in
extra-territorial jurisdiction. So, I would ask that you vote on this
amendment, to just leave the bill the way it is, and to move those
members of the county to the city planning and zoning and city board of
adjustment, because the new statute, will no longer give cities the
authority to do zoning in the county, or annexation, for that matter,
until 2025. Thank you for your support.
Speaker:  Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak in opposition to the amendment.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Representative: My good friend and colleague from Buckham, I respect
what she is trying to do but, I think, if you look at the long term
history at what has occurred in Buckham County, the county
representative on the board of adjustments, planning and zoning, have
been some very good members. They have represented the interests of the
city very well. Many of them have been chairs of particular boards. The
county does have a significant interest in what happens in the county,
so, I think it can be argued it’s appropriate for county rp’s to remain
on board of adjustments. I would like this chamber to understand and
note that the political majority of commissioners is the same as the
political majority of Asheville city council, so they should be able to
sit down and work together, and so I do not think this amendment would
be necessary under these terms and conditions. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? If not, the question before the
house is the passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative
Fisher to house committee substitute to house bill 224. All in favor
will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote: 39 having voted in

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow members of the House, it’s indeed an
honor to come before you today and recognize someone from my home County
of Columbus who has done an outstanding job in their career, ?? law, as
you have heard from the resolution, there is lot of points on there that
I could make. One of those points might be the fact that he was a
one-term member of the House Representatives and I told his son earlier
that I might be following in his footsteps too based on some of the
things that we do up here in this legislature. But I do feel like that
Ed Williamson who has been – I have known the family and known the law
firm for long time…</p>

Work with them have done a really outstanding job. It's been the kind of
person you would expect to be a really good leader in my home county of
Columbus. I do appreciate the fact that his family is here today and I
think the Speaker will recognize this a little bit later. I do want to
say that if I had to follow in the footsteps of one person, as a civic
leader, I would like to follow in Ed Williamson's footsteps. He did die
in February of this year at the ripe old age of 89 and I hope, if God's
willing, that I will live in good health that long. Mr. Speaker, having
said all that I commend the resolution to you.

Representative Davis, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house when I first
started practicing law in 1977 I was an Assistant District Attorney for
the state of North Carolina in Columbus, Bladen, and Brunswick counties.
In that capacity I got to know Ed. I tried many cases against him, he
was a great adversary, great lawyer, and wonderful mentor. When I was
appointed as a federal prosecutor one of the most fascinating cases I
was involved with, Ed Williamson was one of the other lawyers on the
other side. Once again, a great lawyer, and a great adversary, and a
great mentor. Many of you may have read the book, The Devil in Pew 13,
which is based on that particular legal case. But, Ed was just a
wonderful man. He was somebody I admired very much, I respected very
much. His son, Carlton is here today. I got to know Carlton. His oldest
son, ??, is one of my best friends and golfing partners. He was here to
meet a girl that I grew up with here in Wilmington. His nephew Craig,
who was a law school classmate of mine is here. He was a great man,
although I did not know what he did as a member of the House, but I'm
sure he was a true asset and a credit to us all. I commend the
resolution to. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Ance Hollamon of the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer stated
to the Metropolitan Sewage Water System Committee of the LRC, the
Legislative Research Commission, that the City of Asheville water system
is financially sound and well-managed. The bill before you today
dismantles original legislation that was passed as a partnership between
city, county and state government in recognition of the need to invest
in transportation infrastructure to support more than 40,000 citizens
who commute into Asheville for work, school, services, and tourism. The
legislators who sponsor these bills say that they want the city and
county to work together to solve issues around these enterprise systems.
But yet they continue to sponsor bills that further drive a wedge
between the two.  Asheville is not unlike any of the cities that you all
come from. Your local chambers of commerce are daily strategizing on how
to bring businesses, tourists, and new residences to your cities. Our
cities are the economic hubs of our state and this bill servers to
further cripple Asheville’s, and potentially your city’s, ability to
make decisions, local decisions, that are crucial to their continued
success and future viability. Please join me in showing your support for
the city of Asheville and the futures of your cities, by voting no on
this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wadell, please state your purpose.

Representative Moffitt, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt, does the city of Asheville have a water and
sewer reserve fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure, Representative Wadell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The reason I ask that question is most cities and towns are able to have
a water and sewer reserve fund. And we use that fund for matching grants
or to do those repairs like were in that bill. And I was informed that
the city of Asheville did not have a water and sewer reserve fund.
Excuse me, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I believe, I mean this is a public enterprise, so it is a separate
subdivision of the state. So when you’re – That would be a question

recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Brawley moves to end amendment number two on
page one, lines four through five by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. The purpose of this amendment
is to ensure notice is in fact given by requiring that proof of that
notice be created. And the only way I know how to do that is certified
return receipt requested. Right now, the bill we have, we give people a
choice of notice, but in neither case is there a proof of delivery. And
a question that I would ask is, why are we even bothering? If we put in
a law that requires notice, it's because we are concerned people will
not notify a lien holder that their property is about to be sold. If we
trust them to give notice without having any proof, why don't we just
trust them to already been in contact talking about it. Most people that
run self storage do so very honorably. These are not the people that
whom our regulations are addressed. Quite candidly, we put in speed
limits, not because of the safe drive...</p>

…some of us who drive too fast. I want to compare and contrast two ways
that properties handle. As a guy in commercial real estate I rent
apartments, let’s assume I rent an apartment, I rent a self storage and
they both go into default on the same day. About five days in I send a
notice in both cases, you are behind on your rent, you need to send some
money. Another 10 – I also send the notice to the apartment holder
saying if you don’t reply in 10 days and start working on this, I will
have to start in an eviction. 10 days later I go down to the Clerk of
Court, I file a writ of posses, well, not, excuse me, not a writ of
possession, I writ a case for – it's basically an eviction. I forget the
term, it’s got an odd term, and I don’t ever use it. But basically you
file for an eviction. At that point, the apartment dweller receives a
letter from the Clerk of Court that a suit has been filed. The sheriff
shows up an either hands them a copy of the compliant or posts it on
their front door, giving them a time and a date at which small-claims
court will hear my claim for rent due in the apartment. If the posting
is the way that notice is given by leaving it on the door and that
person does not show up for the small claims hearing, I can get no lien
for money, no judgment for money, the only thing I can get is an order
for possession. If they're given personal service or if they show up, I
can get a judgment for money, but it doesn’t give me a lien on any of
their possession. About two weeks later, if they haven’t moved out, I
can come back pay another fee, have the sheriff come out, padlocked the
premises if they have not left. They then have 10 days to recover their
goods and I have no lien on those goods. And if they do not take them, I
can donate them to a charity or I can throw them away, but I cannot sell
them and apply a dime of that for the rent that’s due. And that process
takes about two months. In self storage, we are about two months in, I
send the notice, we really don’t know whether the notice was delivered,
and in some cases, we may not even know if it’s sent, most of the time
that’s not going to matter, because the person has been reaching out
that entire time. But whatever notice they send, in 20 days they sell
the contents and apply it to the rent, and remit the rest of the stay.
What I would suggest to you is we are protecting the property of the
self storage owner much better. And we are protecting the property of
the apartment owner, the home owner, rent it, losing your house is
probably a lot worse than losing the contents of your self storage unit.
The change this makes is only one, that 60-day point, you send the
letter, notified return receipt requested, yeah, it costs about 6 bucks.
If it’s delivered, you get proof it was delivered, so you know, they
know that you are going to sell their stuff. If it is returned as
undeliverable, if it is returned as refused, if it is returned because
they would not pick it up, my amendment says that counts as notice and
you can go ahead and sell. I don’t believe this is an unreasonable
burden. I wish ?? not necessary at all. Most of the people that will
have to do this don’t need to, they are honest and honorable. If we
could pass a law, that says, everybody is going to behave and be a good
neighbor, we wouldn’t be doing it. It’s only the guys that don’t act
right that we need to address. I ask for your support on this amendment.
Thank you.

And I wish Ronnie Sutton was still here. For those of you who remember
Ronnie Sutton, he is going to say, we're beating the dead horse, the
horse is dead, leave it alone. If Representative Brawley really is
adamant about this amendment, I'd tell him we could agree to disagree
and let the body decide. This is more rigorous than it was currently in
law. We put lots of other protections in this bill for the consumers.
Currently, they can't do anything on the first day you're ??, they can't
do 10 days after you're ??, they've got to wait 60 days till you're ??
before they can do anything. This amendment that Representative Murry
offered yesterday…</p>

Is an effort to trot and get the consumer, to the person who is doing it
in best way possible. You can send sort of fine to last known address
and guess what, most of the times these times when these people have
their stuff in storage, they are moving, they are continuing to move in
various locations and may not have kept you updated with an address. So
we have left the option in an effort to get two more people, we have
left the option to do it by e-mail, that works for lot of people because
that e-mail is going to follow you wherever your computer goes and
representative Mari's amendment yesterday said if we'll send it by
e-mail if that's what you request you can sign off in the contract and
we can do that. Representative Mari's amendment went a long way to
taking care of making sure we have notice and I'd ask that you vote the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mobley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask a question to representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I remember correctly, we talked about this notice in the committee
and I thought I heard you say or someone say that the post office can
send assurance of notice or some type of notice without it being
certified. Am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't think there is, there was in the previous bill before this ever
came up, certified mail, and that's simply saying I did in fact put in
the mail, doesn't say whether anybody got it. We have changed it to
first class mail and the requirement of giving e-mail option. Now the
other thing about certified return receipt requested as representative
Brawley put it forth, Three point people won't pick them up. One, they
work 8 to 5, they can't go to post office. They are not home when
someone brings it and they don't want to be bothered and someone people
know it's illegal and they don't want to deal with it. SO I think it's
less likely to get to people if it's a certified return receipt request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lady yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am not sure if you understood my question. Was there not a statement
made in the committee that the post office will provide a notice that it
was delivered without charge or with a lesser charge than the certified?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, there is not. There is a certified mail which simply says you did in
fact put it in there addressed to this person and there is a charge for
that asw ell but that does not certifies that they got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wondered if the general lady would yield for a question,
representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, wanna talk to me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi Sarah. Sarah, is there anything in the law as exist or would exist
after this amendment that prevents a self storage owner form using
e-mail to reach out to his tenant to advice them that they are at fault
and do all of the collection steps that one might take in attempt to
recover your money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would not under the existing statue before it passed the new bill.
Under the existing statue it's simply to send a certified letter, If
they did it by e-mail, it does not counts as attempted notice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Would the lady yield for a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would a reasonable person assume that they have already tried to reach
out using any mail, an e-mail address they have in attempt to collect
the money which is the ideal situation so is it not reasonable for a
person to wonder if your final notice of sale is by that same method if
it's not a waste of time if you have not heard for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I agree with you and the same thing would apply with the certified mail
because they would be using exactly the same address they have been
using all along with the certified mail. They'll be using the same
address all along. If these people rather have their money then
foreclose, it's more of a nuisance to foreclose and sell property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would suspect in most cases. Does she yield for a third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under my amendment, the certified return receipt letter, if it's not
picked up or refused will then count as sufficient notice and allow them
to proceed having demonstrated good faith effort to reach out and prove
that they did in fact make a reasonable effort, an un refutable effort
I'd say to contact and prove that the person needed to contact.

I say that the first class mail or..</p>

...email would serve the same purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Jeter please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the amendment
sponsor a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ...does the gentleman
yield? The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As, as someone who stores
freight for a living, 96 warehouses in 38 states and four US
territories, including over 22, I counted today, 22 self-storage units.
I didn't actually want to get involved in this bill but I have one
clarification question and you may have just answered it. Is your
amendment state, that if you send it certified mail, and it comes back
unclaimed, that under your amendment, has satisfied your desi-, it
doesn't have to come back as received, it just has to say it was
delivered and nobody took it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It satisfies the notice
requirement but I do want to correct the gentleman in what would happen.
He will either get a receipt where it was delivered and accepted, he
will get a statement from the post office that the addressee refused to
accept delivery or he will get a notice from the post office that at
least three attempts were made to deliver it and it was un-deliverable,
or lastly the post office will return it and say that it is not
forwardable. What it will demonstrate is that you have in fact attempted
to make notice, and you will have proof that you attempted to make
notice. And that's all we're trying to accomplish here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So when that process is completed, even without
confirmation that, that, the, the property owner received it. It
satisfied it, and then the lien holder on the self-storage unit can then
dispose of the property legally. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed exactly the
same as they would under the bill as it now stands. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would
ask that we do not vote for this amendment. My concern is that most of
in, especially in North Carolina, these storage units are for, I,
especially in eastern North Carolina, for our military. Most of our
military, they leave that address. When you send that notice that Mr.
Brawley, I'm sorry Representative Brawley has asked you to send, you're
gonna get that exact response. That is not, there's not gonna be anyone
there. But they can be reached on that ship or on that, in Afghanistan
by email. And they can let you know that they're not gonna be back in
six months but they will make sure that their spouse or someone gets you
a payment. So I would ask that we do allow that, the amendment that
Representative Murry put on there, for them to allow you to send them an
email and make that part of the contract. That they will give you that
email address. And then they're cognisant of the fact that you will be
notifying them by email if you're out of country. So, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] By, by point of clarification the lady is referring to
an amendment that's already passed, not the amendment before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, I was, that, that's correct. I was asking you to
vote against Representative Brawley's amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bill Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the gentle lady
yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative if the self storage owner has an email address
that they would use, be the only way they're required, under
Representative Murry's bill, and that person is unable to receive that
email, would they, how would they then receive notice? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be the way they receive notice. They would have marked on
that contract, that's the way they receive notice. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to ask a follow up question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anything
in the bill of which you're aware that would prevent them from sending
an email, even if my amendment passes, to that individual in service
overseas. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I don't think there would be anything
that would prevent it. But I think that, that would be in addition to
what they would be required to do. That would put another burden on them
that is not required at this present time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the

[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I rise to speak in favor of this amendment because
really, if you're going to seize someone's property, as a landlord, I
have a good bit of experience in this, you want to make every effort to
communicate with them if you haven't had a good result in doing that. So
I think this is a, for $6 to have verifiable effort in addition to what
we have passed as an amendment previously, to give them the opportunity
to be communicated with by e-mail or by certified mail. This is just a
second manner before you take their property and sell it. That does
indeed protect the storage owner, in my opinion, from all kinds of
claims that they did indeed really stole their property. So I think this
is a reasonable amendment and actually helps the situation rather than
hurts it. Thank you.

Representative Arp, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this House Bill 392 is two-fold.
It’s to prevent fugitive, felons and probation and parole violators from
receiving financial assistance in accordance with federal law. It’s to
make sure that financial law goes to law-abiding citizens first. Number
2, if information of an outstanding warrant is received by DSS&lt; then
DSS shall as immediately as practicable but within 72 hours after
receiving that information, notify a local law enforcement agency. This
bill makes a public policy statement. That all state agencies to work
with law enforcement to keep the public safe. And that any public
assistance should first go to law-abiding citizens.  I think a little
bit of background is in order to understand how this bill came about.
2011 a caseworker’s job was reportedly jeopardized and the county
department of social services worker was put on an action plan by the
state after the case worker notified a deputy sheriff working in the
agency that a person seeking public assistance benefits had an
outstanding arrest warrant.  The deputy promptly arrest the convicted
felon. A few weeks earlier, a similar situation had occurred and the
person was arrested.  The state, then contacted county officials and
said if an outstanding arrest warrant is noted, a local caseworker
cannot act on that information.  The state and DSS went on to say that
the county agency should not have accessed that information and should
not have shared that information with the local law enforcement officers
and that they are not duty bound to report that information to law
enforcement officers. Now let me tell you about the person seeking aid.
This person was a convicted felon. This person was from out of state.
This person was convicted of an aggravated robbery with a weapons
charge. I think the victim was pistol whipped. This person than came to
North.</p>

North Carolina, was arrested again on a drug charge. This person was
then a parole violator and an outstanding arrest warrant was issued for
this person. The caseworker did the right thing in reporting this and
for that her job was in jeopardy.
Ladies and gentleman this has happened to our county and it’s happening
to your county as well.  I think a little bit about the federal law is
in order as well. Federal law under specifically 42USC 601A9 refers to
block grants for temporary assistance to needy families. Under section 9
it’s titled, Denial of Assistance for Fugitive Felons and Parole and
Probation Violators.
It specifically states that a State to which a grant is made, shall not
use any part of that grant to provide assistance to individuals who are
basically fleeing felons and paroled and probation violators. It goes on
to say that if a state enacts safeguards against public information,
that those safeguards cannot prevent that information from being shared
with local law enforcement officers.
This aid is commonly called TANF. The other one is Food and Nutrition
Supplements, which specifically states that individuals fleeing to avoid
prosecution and custody shall not receive any benefits under this law.
With that seven other states have enacted similar provisions regarding
this and with that I commend the Bill to you.
[Speaker change]:  Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[Representative Brandon]: To ask a question and then speak on the Bill,
to the Bill sponsor.
[Speaker change]:  Representative ??, does the gentleman yield?
[Representative ??]: Yes I would.
[Speaker change]: Gentleman yields.
[Representative Brandon]: Thank you Representative. I thought that we
did this Bill last year. Can you tell me the difference between
Representative Sane’s Bill and this Bill, because it seems like we
already addressed similar issues?
[Representative ??]: I wasn’t here last year. This is my Bill.
[Representative Brandon]: Is it okay if I ask Representative Sane is he
knows ?? ?
[Speaker change]:  Representative Sane, does the gentleman yield?
[Representative Sane]:  I do.
[Speaker change]: Gentleman yields.
[Representative Sane]: To answer your question Representative, that Bill
had to deal more with absconders who were currently absconding from
parole where the parole officer would initiate whether or not they could
receive benefits or not. That would be the fine line of this. This Bill
deals with more on that side of things. But that was initiated on side
of the parole officer, who would initiate whether or not the person was
absconding or not.
[Representative Brandon]: Speak on the Bill.
[Speaker changes]: The gentleman’s recognized to debate the Bill.
[Representative Brandon]: I think that’s a major difference between the
Bill, because we have to be very careful when we talk about what fleeing
is. When we have fleeing, sometimes that’s a parent that hasn’t found a
job because they are an ex-felon and they can’t get a job and they
cannot pay their child support. That is considered fleeing.
Then we’re going to say, oh, by the way, you can’t get a job. Now you
can’t go to school with financial aid and now you can’t get assistance
for housing. So folks we just have to be very careful in what you’re
talking about these type of situations because you keep taking the feet
out from underneath people and the only thing that you do is drive them
right back into crime.
It’s not making anything safer. Not one iota. What I say is, people are
always going to eat. You’re going to eat, and I’m going to eat and
ex-offenders and ex-felons, they’re going to eat. They’re going to eat
the right way or the way they have to. If you force them to eat in a way
that is illegal, that’s the way they’re going to do it. If you take away
the assistance, if you take away the ability to go to school and get
trained, you take away the ability for them to have a house or to live
then you will…
[Speaker change]: Mr. Speaker?
[Speaker change]: Representative Art, please state your purpose.
[Representative Art]: I’m asking if Representative Brandon would yield
for a question?
[Speaker change]: Does the gentleman yield for a question?
[Representative Brandon]: Absolutely.
[Speaker change]: Gentleman yields.
[Representative Art]: Representative Brandon, are you referring to
previously convicted felons or are you referring to this Bill addresses
fleeing felons that are currently under prosecution, not a past
convicted felon. This Bill addresses the ability of a current absconder
from justice. Is that what you’re referring to?
[Representative Brandon]: Yes. That’s what I’m referring to because in
this Bill, the last Bill that we did, we had a probation officer who has
been working with that client that could be very clear to determine
whether that</p>

is actually fleeing or not. Here we have an abstract way of thinking
about what fleeing is. And I'm just saying, we have to be careful of
what we consider what fleeing is. Does that mean that you have a court
date that you didn't go to,or you have violated parole because you have
not been able to pay for child support, there's all types of reasons for
every story you gave in your eloquent speech.I can name you 500 stories
where people are not fleeing. But what would be considered fleeing
according to this bill? And so what I'm saying is last year with
representatives saying we worked on that bill, the parole officer had
alot more understanding and control about what was actually fleeing, and
I would like to see something in this bill and I will legit to third to
see if that is something that we can do, because I think we really have
to be careful to abstractly say,'somebody's fleeing', because there's
tons of people out there who aren't' really fleeing, just doesn't have
the resources they need to complete their case. And this leaves that
wide open, so that's just my point.

Representative Fisher, please state your purpose

Representative Arp this gentleman you?
[speaker change]

[speaker change]
Gentleman you
[speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Arp, I'm just wondering if you
have looked into what the cost of this bill might in terms of criminal
background checks that the state would have to do, or the cost to the
counties to do this.
[speaker change]
yes
[speaker change]
Follow up?
[speaker change]
Is Gentleman yield for a follow up?
[speaker changes]
yes
[speaker changes]
gentleman yields
[speaker changes]
Representative Arp, do you have a fiscal note for this bill?
[speaker changes]
The.. We don't have a fiscal note but there's no cost to the state.
There will be cost associated with that. I would say that the background
checks are used very commonly. For instance, in order to purchase a gun,
those background checks, they are born by the applicant. In this case,
the background check is born by the government. I think we actually have
public and overwhelming support of the public, to any minimal cost of
the applicant to assure that the right people receive this public
assistance. I think we owe it to our teachers, in this time of economic
crisis, I think we owe it to every law abiding citizen and family. There
is truly a need. I don't think we can look them in the eye and say we
just don't have enough money for you, because we don't think it is
worthy enough for us to do our due diligence and ensure that criminals
are not receiving the funds.
[speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, follow up
[speaker changes]
Does the gentleman yield?
[speaker changes]
Yes
[speaker changes]
Gentleman yields
[speaker changes]
You said you had looked into the cost. Do you know what the cost would
be to the counties?
[speaker changes]
I think whats.. here's the problem with that. The information is not
known on how may people are under this because they just simply ask the
person, are you an convicted felon or not, and there's this check off
box on the application. So the credit that would be made is not known,
so there's no cost to the state, and there would be cost to the locals.
[speaker changes]
Do you know what the cost would be to the county?
[speaker changes]
It's inconclusive.
[speaker changes]
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, I apologize. A follow up.
[speaker changes]
The chair has stepped away from the dais. Does the gentleman yield to a
follow up?
[speaker changes]
Yes
[speaker changes]
Gentleman yields.
[speaker changes]
And, so do you have a figure for the cost to the counties?
[speaker changes]
I don't have a definitive figure, no.
[speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, to speak just briefly on the bill.
[speaker changes]
Lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, while I respect the members
prerogative in terms of coming forward with this legislation, I cannot
support the bill as currently written, because for one thing, we don't
know how much it will cost. We already see that it will be some sort of
unfunded mandate to the counties, and at the very least, it should
probably go back to the drawing board for a little bit more study before
it comes to the floor for a vote, and I would appreciate your no vote on
this bill. Thank you.

ask this bill be returned for at least information purposes. I
appreciate Representative Arp’s concern about people receiving benefits
that shouldn’t receive them, and obviously we have that problem across
all benefits we provide through state government. Seems to be on this
particular bill though a lack of information. Seems to be apparently
results from an incident that happened. I don’t know how many
applications for assistance are filled our per month in North Carolina
per year, etcetera, but we have a bill that according to Representative
Arp’s statement came from one incident that happened. Certainly
thousands people apply at least on an annual basis for assistance, and
so for us to presume that there is a problem here that would justify the
cost that we would have to incur and push down onto these local
governments, especially the counties, seems like a large price we would
ask them to pay without knowing whether or not it would solve the
problem necessarily, and knowing whether or not we even have a problem
to solve. Certainly at the end of the day we’ll create a high number of
background checks being instituted, and I would also say at the present
time I would presume that anyone who applies and answers and says they
are not a felon, that that would be a false official statement that
would be punishable by law already if they received the benefits and it
was later discovered that they were a felon, and so it would be an
embezzlement of those benefits, and so I would ask that you not support
this bill. Let’s send it back, find out what the real cost is. Let’s not
penalize our local governments and our local DSS departments for a
problem that does not exist. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the sponsor a
question.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Arp, does the gentleman
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Arp, I’m looking at this bill, and it
says if an applicant, or an applicant or of a recipient, you’re talking
about a check reveals that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of
the applicant or recipient for commission of a felony or a misdemeanor,
and the word concerning me here is the word “misdemeanor” being used in
here. Are you telling me that a person who has an arrest warrant out for
a misdemeanor could be denied benefits or could have his benefits denied
under this bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. The rest of the bill, if you read
onto the rest of the bill, it says that the only benefits denied are to
fleeing felons and parole and probation violators. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well then I’m assuming then that the reason you’ve got “misdemeanors” is
if there is an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor, that person is
free to report that to existing law enforcement officers? Am I correct
on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe you’re correct. I think the idea is
that information sharing from law enforcement officers and DSS, this is
to facilitate that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One question further. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So if there’s an arrest
warrant out for a speeding violation, that information would have to be
shared with law enforcement? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you have an arrest
warrant, yes. If you have an arrest warrant for a speeding ticket, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Arp, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will
yield all day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will yield all day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Arp, does this bill apply to the people
who are currently receiving these benefits, or only to new applicants?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s a good question. There was some confusion about
this. This bill becomes effective when passed, and what it does is apply
to recipients. It first applies to applicants in the process, and then
it applies to applicants who reapply or concurrently, only when they
reapply for benefits. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We discussed this bill in Health</p>

The human services standing committee, yesterday. There was quite a
discussion on the impact on counties. We each live in counties that comb
and represent our county governments too. These background checks cost
about $38 each. There are currently about 122 families that are enrolled
in food stamps. One hundred twenty two thousand people who are enrolled
in food stamps.
These people have to apply every year. This is gonna be a significant
drain on our county's government budgets and I'm surprised that we
haven't had more feedback from your local county DSS directors on this
bill so far. We are doing committee work, right here on the floor. This
bill needed to stay in committee another day in order to get some of
these issues worked out. Can the counties use TANF money to pay for
this, or does it have to come from new appropriation, or does it have to
come from their general fund? Where will they get the money to pay for
this and actually what is the impact on our counties? We don't know this
and I would request that this bill get sent back to committee to have
another day of work on it. If we vote on it today you should certainly
vote no on this. This is not, we are not representing our county
governments, are elected officials, and our counties by putting this
burden on them, or the people who live in those counties who might have
to pay additional taxes to cover this cost. So, either send the bill
back to committee or please vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I stand reluctantly but the more I read, less
reluctantly. In opposition, on second reading I hope that some questions
can get answered on third reading tomorrow. But let me explain, I don't
disagree with part of the policy because I've run before a number of
record check bills and believe in the general principal of that but I
think we have to be really clear what's happening here. If you look on
the second page, line 16, what we're saying is for hundreds of thousands
of applicants a year for the program involved on the county level, the
county department of social services shall ensure that the state and
national criminal history of an applicant or... Where's my computer? ...
that it's fully constitutional based on some stuff I read last week but
I'm gonna to check on that tonight, I just didn't know it was coming up.
But if you get past that, my objection is we are gonna be spending, in
my view, it's got to be millions of dollar a year to do this and I'm not
sure that that cost is worth the benefit. There's got to be a way to
restrict this and limit it and certainly to provide if we're gonna
require assistance for the county social services, my request would be
that the bill get re-referred to a J-committee to be refined, or at
least if that we hold it, if representative Arp is willing, because I
think there's some really legitimate questions being raised, not about
the policy, but about the implementation and the cost. So if we have to
vote today, I will vote no and object to third. I would hope that we
would hold it though and answer those questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

<p id="85:00">
I just want to make a couple points about the substance and a couple
points about the procedure. First, substantively... I agree with
Representative Arp that we need to make sure that the folks who are
getting benefits are the folks who are properly and rightfully entitled
to receive benefits and that folks are ineligible that get benefits
should not receive those benefits. The federal law states that folks
that have been fleeing prosecution, evading arrest, are ineligible to
receive these types of benefits. But this particular bill says folks
that have outstanding warrants for arrest. This particular bill also
applies to outstanding warrants for arrest for misdemeanors as well as
felonies, when the federal law only makes folks ineligible if they are
fleeing prosecution for felony offenses. So this is different from the
federal rules and regulations which Representative Arp said we were
trying to come into compliance with with this bill. Additionally, there
is a big difference between folks that are trying to flee arrest or flee
prosecution from folks that have an outstanding warrant for arrest.
There's a very thin burden required for someone to get a warrant for
arrest issued for them. That is a much lower burden than being able to
say someone is an absconder, which I think they referenced in an earlier
bill, that's a much higher burden than just someone having a warrant for
arrest issued out on you. I could go to Mecklenburg County, I'm from
Vance County, I can go Mecklenburg County and say that somebody down
there in Mecklenburg County, if I know their name and their address,
stole a phone from me, I can go to the magistrate's office, get a
warrant for that person's address if I know their name and I know their
address, and there will be an outstanding warrant for that person's
arrest. That person lives in Vance County. They're not fleeing arrest.
They just don't know that there's a warrant out there for them. They're
not absconding. There's no notice requirement, we've been talking a
whole lot about notice requirements. There is no notice requirement that
somebody be put on notice that there's an outstanding warrant for their
arrest. So just because someone has an outstanding warrant for their
arrest does not mean that they're fleeing prosecution, that they're
absconding, which is the basis for the denial of benefits under federal
law. Additionally, this bill does not save us money. It costs us money.
If someone is ineligible because of their background, they're
ineligible, regardless of whether we require the DSS to transfer that
information over to the police department, regardless if we have someone
there doing these background checks on them every single time, they're
ineligible. We're not saving any money. In fact, it's going to cost us
money, you've heard that alluded to during the debate, the fiscal memo
is inconclusive. It's going to cost us a whole lot of money to do this.
Just briefly on the procedure, we had this bill come up in committee
yesterday, and it was like I said, we had a very good debate. It was
added on to the calendar yesterday late for first reading. And now it's
up for second and third reading today. Not a whole lot of time for folks
to be able to really review this stuff and try to understand it. I think
that there is a way that we can accomplish what Representative Arp wants
to do, I completely agree, our agencies ought to be able to communicate
with each other. Our agencies ought to be able to work together so that
one knows what's going on with the other agencies. I don't necessarily
think that this is the best way to do that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Arp, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To pull a bill on calendar for tomorrow.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wonder if the gentleman would consider Tuesday
instead of tomorrow. Even though we have all the lights on that we do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.

the question.</p>
