  Please take their seat where going to go ahead and get started we got a
lot to do today and not much time to do it. We have two sergeants at
arms today Jim Hamilton and Giles Jeffreys. I want to welcome ya&#39;ll.
Our our pages are Alma Mahter  sponsored by Senator Mcguinness, Sam
Krauss, by Senator Heist. Stephin Little by Senator Stein, and finally
we have Amruth Repiruth Bedur, who was born in Hydrabad India and Audre
Padre State and speaks Hindi and pelagu and English. So we are proud to
have him here. We had two bills today for consideration. how many do we
need for a quorum? Five? First bill is Senate bill 105 and we have a
propose committee substitute. so do hear a motion that we hear the
propose committee substitute by senator Davis? and second by senator
raven. senator brown would you like to tell us about this bill. {SPEAKER
CHANGE} Thank you Mr. chairman i will first id like to run a amendment
if i could Mr. chairman. {SPEAKER CHANGE} ok i believe everybody has a
copy of the amendment [SPEAKER CHANGE]i think its pretty explanatory on
page two it just rewrites the line to read liability company and this
state during the period covered by the report who are veterans so
basically what the amendment does is make sure we&#39;re talking about
veterans in north Carolina only. [SPEAKER CHANGE] do i have a motion.
motion by senator Davis to approve the amendment second by senator
wydell. now the PCS sentra band you want to explain it or lets [SPEAKER
CHANGE] I&#39;ll try to get through it and maybe staff can add but this
bill really comes out of the military affairs commission [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Mr. chair just real brief i think we need to probably cure a
devote on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] oh I&#39;m sorry all in favor
that the question amendment say aye. Aye. all appose. ok it passes.
Thank you senator Davis. [SPEAKER CHANGE] again this bill comes out of
the military affairs commission. and what it really relates to is why,
how were trying to make north Carolina the most business friendly state
in the nation and i think  trying to measure how many veterans we have
working in our state is a key piece of that. so what the bill does is
under current law domestic and foreign companies insurance companies and
L.L.C.s have to deliver a annual report to the Secretary of state.  that
includes name of the entity and the state or country under which law is
incorporated the street and mailing address if different of the
registered office the county in which it is located in the name of
registered agents address and telephone numbers of principal offices
names titles and business addresses of principal offices and a brief
description of the nature of the business what this bill does is also
add a requirement that each domestic corporation and each foreign
corporation plus each L.L.C. and each foreign L.L.C. authorize to
transact business in the state to include in its annual report to the
secretary of state the number of full time equivalent employees employed
by the corporation of this state during the period covered who are
veterans. the P.C.S. also defines the terms such as the number of full
time equivalent employees qualified service and what veterans truly mean
and the bill would direct the secretary of state to compile and publish
summary information about the number of veterans employed in this state
a corporations and L.L.C.s on its website on or before October one of
each year the P.C.S. would also direct the department of labor insurance
and commerce implore security commission industrial commission to assist
the secretary of state and notifieng the public of the requirement to
report the number of veterans employed by corporations and L.L.C.
effective date is January one of two thousand and sixteen. i think i
covered it pretty well. [SPEAKER CHANGE] alright we have a motion by
senator raven unfavorable to the original bill favorable to the P.C.S.
is there a second. to Roland to the new P.C.S. ?? Sam. come in? any
comments from the committee? senator Davis. [SPEAKER CHANGE] thank you
Mr. chair senator brown thank you so much for bringing us forward as
north Carolina positions itself to remain a military friendly state one
thing that came out of program evaluation is a lot of times we-

  <p id="05:00">
  Do not know what&#39;s going on, so this is a great measure, and thank
you so much for bringing this forward, and I look forward to voting for
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, and mister chairman, secretary of state&#39;s office has been in
contact with me, and I think we changed a little language to help with
them. So I think they&#39;re okay with the bill as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Any other comments from the committee? Okay, all in favor say aye.
All opposed no, and the bill passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Thank you committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Brown. Okay, we have Senate bill 112, Senator Cook,
commercial fishing courses for the coastal colleges. Senator Cook, would
you explain the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a bill. Got to punch a button somewhere. How about that? Can you
hear me now? Hear me now. All right. This is SB 122, commercial fishing
courses, coastal colleges. This bill simply urges coastal community
colleges to offer fishing courses on commercial fishing and aquaculture.
Aquaculture courses are currently being offered at only two coastal
community colleges, Carteret Community College and Brunswick Community
College. Carteret Community College offers courses that can be
transferred to a four year marine biology program at UNC Wilmington or
East Carolina University. Brunswick Community College also offers an
aquaculture program although its curriculum focuses on freshwater
aquaculture. In North Carolina, there is a significant potential for
aquaculture to become a greater source of income and economic prosperity
for North Carolina&#39;s commercial fishing industry. We&#39;re the
largest estuary in the nation that doesn&#39;t span across other states.
There, there was explosive growth in oyster aquaculture sales in
Virginia but practically flat growth in North Carolina. Currently,
I&#39;m working on a different bill that will improve oyster fishing
industry in North Carolina. For this industry to grow in North Carolina,
we need to make sure our coastal community colleges are offering courses
that support aquaculture. This bill will do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, do we have a motion for a favorable report on this bill? Senator
Alexander, a second? We&#39;ll do questions after the motion. Do we have
a second? Okay, Senator Sanderson. Okay, now any questions or comments
from the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a couple of questions. I think it looks like a good bill, but for
the bill sponsor. Mister chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma&#39;am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the bill sponsor, I would wonder if you have done any inquiry with
the community college board since they have the, they do the research in
terms of what we need, course offerings, course, this may cost some,
require some cost to some of those college. When you implement a course,
you gotta get somebody to teach it of course, et cetera. But I&#39;m
saying that the community colleges would look at whether we should offer
it here and what, what kind of students, and interest, et cetera there
may be in this particular community college. I think it&#39;s a good
idea, but I&#39;m saying in terms of the community college structure
itself, in terms of looking where that kind of possible enrollment might
come from, it may make sense for them to say, well, we&#39;ll start
right here, this particular college, and offer access because we might
not get but 10 or 15. And I guess my question is that as well as does
this bill allow for gradual increase amongst community colleges as
opposed to implementing across all of those on the coast.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the bill just urges them to look into it. It&#39;s not requiring
them to do anything, so they can, they can do it as they see fit. They
can move forth as they see fit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, the first question. Senator Cook, go back to the first. Thank you
mister chair. In terms of your inquiry with the community colleges
boards. Have you talked to any of the community colleges?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A little bit. Not a lot

  <p id="10:00">
  I think I&#39;ve mentioned it to a couple of college presidents,
they&#39;re fine with it as far as I can tell.  This is, again, just
urging folks to look at providing courses that will help encourage our
aquiculture industry in North Carolina.  We have tremendous potential
for this to grow, it&#39;s worth hundreds of millions of dollar to the
economy of North Carolina, as so far it&#39;s just sort of withering on
the vine.   And this is just one way to encourage folks to consider a
career in this and to provide them with them with the tools to be part
of this industry.   We often hear about how farmers in North Carolina
have an age, I think the average age is around 59 years old.  I&#39;m a
little older than that so I can appreciate the gravity of that concern.
I think I would submit that it&#39;s probably worse with the fishermen.
Fishermen are being run out of business.  As far as I can tell, we used
to have a thriving fishing industry  and aquiculture was on the horizon,
and now we done.  Now, because of crazy regulations, mostly Federal, we
have a situation where fishermen are a dying breed.  This is just
another way to encourage it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, thank you.  Senator Davis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thanks, Mr. Chair, and just had a brief comment, more
so.  I think the merits is really sound and urging is not a shall and
absolute, but along the sentiment that Senator Robinson was sharing,
there may be also consideration given to, obviously, getting those
queued that are still around in the industry to bring them to the table,
and I think that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, thank you, any other comments?  Staff, do you
have any?  Okay, all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed no, it passes.  Thank you Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Chairman and Committee, I appreciate you
allowing me to speak to you today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, now we have three information speakers, the first
is NC Chamber, Gary Salamido.  Is Gary here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee.
It&#39;s a privilege to be here today.  I&#39;m going to go through a
presentation relatively quickly in respect to the other two folks that
need to get up and talk with you.  A little bit about workforce
development and economic development and what it means.  It&#39;s been
an important piece of what the business community and particularly the
North Carolina Chamber over the last few years has been working on in
order to connect our education, our talent, our development, and our
talent supply our young people with jobs as we get through this very
difficult time in our economy.  How do we get everybody back on track
and how do we get as many folk looking for, and finding, and getting the
opportunities in the jobs that they need.   Quick snapshot on the North
Carolina Chamber, about 35,000 members who employ about 1.2 million
North Carolinians.  About 30% of the total private sector workforce is a
member of the North Carolina Chamber.  100% business funded, all by our
members, small and large, and we&#39;re the state affiliate of the US
Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.  So
we have a broad base of members that we draw upon when questions like
what&#39;s going on, what&#39;s happening with the workforce that we
need to have, some input and some answers for.  There&#39;s four key
pillars, that to be a winner in the competition for jobs going forward,
that you have to have a good foundation for, and they work together,
they don&#39;t work in isolation.  The first one is education and talent
supply.  Well over 50% of the jobs in the future are going to require
some post secondary education in some way, shape, or form, in order to
really advance our innovation economy that is so much a part of North
Carolina&#39;s future.

  <p id="15:00">
  You also have to look at entrepreneurship and innovation. Fifty percent
of annual USGDP demand going forward is going to result and be reliant
on innovation. A key statistic here in our competitiveness, our aging
population is going to have an impact on that. Fifty percent are going
to be 65 and older in a few years, which is going to put additional
strains on our health care system and also create opportunities for
folks in that market sector. So there will be job opportunities there,
but there will also be strain on resources. One of the key factors when
we put our plan together was, by the year 2030 economists are predicting
that around 3 million people are going to be coming in to North
Carolina. That&#39;s the equivalent to the entire population of the
state of South Carolina, making us easily one of the seventh or eighth
most populous states in the country. Which is a great opportunity but
also indicates that we have to create about a million new jobs in that
time period in order to make sure that we keep North Carolina as a Top
Ten competitor here, in the nation, and the world, and make sure our
citizens have opportunities for them going forward. Again, each pillar
is critically important, and they work together. What&#39;s our
challenge? These statistics are from two different places. One of the
sources is the National Manufacturing Association&#39;s Marketing
Institute. And the other was a University of Phoenix study that our
foundation, North Carolina ?? Foundation, commissioned. It shows that
83% of US manufacturers lack skilled workers, and that hurts business.
600,000 US manufacturing jobs go unfilled because of the skills gap, the
gap between what the businesses, and in these particular cases the
manufacturers, need and what our talents apply, what our education
system is connecting with. And North Carolina is competing globally.
Fast-pace and high tech. The speed of business is where we need to begin
to move our connectivity between our talent supply or talent
development, our young people, and where the jobs are. Every year we
survey a number of our members across different economic groups,
different types of businesses. We survey them often. I think what&#39;s
telling here is when you go back to 2011, you can see the green line was
what is the most important? In 2011 it was taxes. But right now it&#39;s
clearly education talent supply and development. It has shifted. Right
now we&#39;re getting our economy competitive. Our business climate is
getting competitive. However, the skills gap is continuing to grow. It
becomes clear, with a steady three-year increase, the importance of a
talent supply and an educated and connected workforce. Linking workforce
development and jobs. First of all, we would be very remiss if we
didn&#39;t really thank Will Collins and the NCWorks folks for all the
good work that they&#39;re doing over there. They have pulled together a
lot of different groups. They are interacting with business on a regular
basis. And they&#39;re beginning to break down the silos in order to
make sure that we do everything we can to get the jobs, the education,
and the people connected so that they can get into those jobs as quickly
as possible. We have to break down those silos. And we have to have our
workforce development system, moving forward, continue to develop and
evolve at the pace of business. Because as technology and innovation
goes, so does the opportunity for people to have new opportunities. But
also they may lose what they&#39;re currently doing, so we have to get
them retrained and we have to get them the experience and education they
need for the jobs of the future. So we have to break down those silos
and move at the speed of business. Some actionable items. We were asked
to pull together some thoughts and considerations for some actual items
we can do to help us with the skills, to help us have the best workforce
development system anywhere. Continue our efforts to maximize the
Certified Work Ready Communities and apprenticeships, which I&#39;ll
give specific examples to in a moment. And again, an incredibly good
NCWorks program that was developed down east, and I&#39;ll give you more
detail on that. Aligning our prosperity zones with WIOA local areas. I
know that there are some sensitivities around those, so we should all
get in the room together and work collectively to make sure that we get
the alignment that we need to get there. Again, we&#39;re not creating
silos, we&#39;re creating opportunity. Better coordination between
NCWorks, business community, and job seekers. That&#39;s going well. We
continue to have good dialogue, and we want to encourage that. The
NCWorks folks in particular have been great at reaching out to business.
We&#39;ve just got to keep that dialogue open. Things change quickly.
And as we continue to talk, we&#39;ll be able to respond quickly.
Establishing employer-based performance measures. What we are talking
about there is, what are the metrics that look at if our talent supply,
our education, our talent development matching up with the needs of the
employers. And how do we measure that? We need to get together in a room
and begin to speak the same language. We&#39;re making great progress
there also. But getting those metrics right
  </p>

  <p id="20:00">
  Bring on those metrics ahead of time about what a business needs, and
what is being produced, and then at the same time saying: Is this
actually linking people with jobs? Those metrics need to be put together
and we need to agree on them. Special veterans initiatives? We were
hearing about a couple earlier today? One that was last session that has
particularly yielded some significant results is getting a waiver for
CDL, the commercial driver&#39;s license for our folks that are coming
out of the military. When that bill was being discussed, there were
about four thousand trucking jobs in North Carolina that were available.
By getting that waiver for the commercial driver&#39;s license we&#39;re
allowing our veterans to come out of the service and get into those
trucking jobs much quicker. Those are the types of things that continue
to help us fill that skills gap— very skilled, very talented people who
have served their country— getting them into the workforce in a more
expeditious manner, and we&#39;re seeing incredibly good results with
that, and we&#39;d be happy to share the data with you. But it&#39;s
working. And last is maximize grant writing and cross agency
coördination. Grant writing is a science, grant writing is a technique,
there are specialists in it. We should make sure that those specialists
work across the agencies in order to take advantage of the different
efficiencies that can happen that way, and also to take advantage of the
opportunities. If you have three or four different grant writers, one
grant may work for one agency, it may not work for another. If we&#39;re
able to maximize that efficiency, we&#39;re able to look at and access
as many of those grants as possible.
Some current North Carolina Business Initiatives: The number one
consumer of an educated populace and educated workforce is business. It
is folks that are in the private sector that are working to try and
produce a product, try and produce a service that meets the needs of a
market. So our number one consumer is business. Businesses are focussed
on achievement and outcomes, all right? So we need a workforce that
continues to be focussed on achievement and outcomes, and we need to be
investing so that they have the skills necessary to meet those needs.
I&#39;m gonna give you three examples now, and I alluded to them
earlier, of very distinct ways that the business community, local and
state, are coming together to help with those achievement and those
outcomes and help to align things. NC Works Certified Work Ready
Community is an initiative of NC Works. It was an opportunity where
folks came together, and they said: We have got to look at our
community, look at the needs of our community, look at the gaps that are
in our individual communities, put key thought leaders together, and
develop a program that matches the gaps with the needs. So, in 2005, the
Community College System, in partnership with the Department of
Commerce, began a pilot program: the North Carolina Certified Work Ready
Communities. The Foundation was the North Carolina East Alliance, which
was really the pioneer behind getting this alignment right [??]. And
NCWorks now serves as the framework for that piece, working with DPI and
working with the business community and groups of local
leaders—there&#39;s a group of folks in each county that designate
themselves, or are in the process of designating themselves for
applicants to the Certified Work Ready process, and again, it&#39;s high
schools, community colleges, businesses, K12, all coming together and
making sure they align with those gaps. Our Chamber Foundation now
serves as the final certifying body for those, too. You&#39;ll be seeing
a press release coming out shortly about the first two counties that
were certified by our Foundation Board. We&#39;ll be certifying anywhere
from five to ten coming up at our August Foundation Board.
What this does is it says that these communities have a workforce that
has meet a certain level of standard of education and workforce
development that businesses can rely on to know: I can go to this
county, I can go to Wake County, Wayne County, Lenoir County, and
they&#39;re ready. They can serve these types of jobs.
Andrews Aviation Academy is an example. I don&#39;t know all the details
on this— we have a good member of ours who&#39;s on it, very involved
with NCWorks, who&#39;s given us some really good examples of how this
began to really address a very specific need in a very specific part of
our state. It&#39;s 150 Aviation Academy students, it&#39;s an early
college program for those folks. It provides the aviation community with
a pipeline of skilled workers where the jobs are, where the facilities
are. It keeps our talented youth in their local communities, and in
North Carolina, and it involves internships, scholarships, degrees,
certifications. We can provide more detail on what that is but it&#39;s
specific to the aviation community. For example, when you look,
there&#39;s FAA licenses and industry certifications such as SOLIDWORKS
and AutoCAD that these young people are coming out with. There&#39;s
also—

  <p id="25:00">
  Air frame and power plant mechanics and avionics technician, and
anything in the aviations business. There&#39;s certifications and
degrees there for these young people that are coming out of these early
college, or excuse me, early high school, early college academy. The
final one I wanna talk about is that the apprenticeship program that is
modeled after apprenticeship 2000 in Charlotte. Now the North Carolina
Triangle apprenticeship program is doing it, and I&#39;ve got a short
video here with, from Buhler Aeroglide which kinda depicts what it&#39;s
like. It&#39;s based on the Austria, Germany, and Switzerland model of
the apprenticeship program. It&#39;s a four year apprenticeship program.
The, the fellow here in the video is gonna describe it. You&#39;re gonna
see an apprentice talk about what it means. After they go through the
process, they have a job directly with that organization. It&#39;s a
trained person who is very loyal to the organization. We&#39;re very
excited. We&#39;re looking at how does the business community directly
get involved with the apprenticeship program. Does our foundation serve
for apprenticeship programs, very similar to what we do with the good,
the good relationship with NC Works on a certified work rated
communities. We&#39;re trying to make sure that we do that in a way that
is very respectful and keep the integrity of this apprenticeship program
and this process intact. At the same time, gets it out to as many folks
as possible. So I think I&#39;ll show this and then I&#39;ll be happy to
ask any questions. In theory. Uh oh. What did I do wrong? Is there a ??
Jake? I&#39;m very technology challenged honestly. Yeah. Oh, there we
go. So you left that piece out for me. There we go. There we go. Thank
you. No sound. It&#39;s not here. Is it? It&#39;s unmuted, right? Oh
okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe someone under 25 can fix it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s right. I can&#39;t, this is a skills gap right here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am the director of human resources at Buhler Aeroglide. I started my
career at Aeroglide two and a half years ago building up the, the human
resource department, but what we really wanted to get into was to fill
the pipeline of our talents, and where I come from in Switzerland
it&#39;s very common that young kids at the age of 16, 17, they decide
either go to college or do a, a trade, learning a trade. And this is
what we wanted to establish in North Carolina, and it&#39;s a real
apprenticeship program. In 2013 we were lucky to find other companies
that wanted to start a venture with us, and so we founded NC TAP,
that&#39;s the short name for North Carolina Triangle Apprenticeship
program. So we having a lot of problems really finding very skilled ??,
especially welders, because we are in the full industry and there we
have very high quality standards. So we decided to invest in this
apprenticeship program in, in North Carolina and the United States.
It&#39;s quite a bit investment. It&#39;s a long term investment but we
are very convinced and the history shows that it will be a success.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The apprenticeship program&#39;s important to Buhler Aeroglide. It&#39;s
to help train our future

  Skill and trade and most of all to help young adults get a start in life
and some of the things we&#39;ve worked on in the apprenticeship
program, they&#39;ve worked on drilling, filing, cutting, mig welding,
?? and ?? working on stainless steel tig welding right now. Personally I
chose the apprenticeship program because going to a four year degree
didn&#39;t exactly appeal to me. I wanted to be able to go ahead and
work and get started and work with my hands a little bit. And so the
apprenticeship program offered a great mix between getting a college
career as well as working with my hands and it&#39;s been good so far.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It&#39;s very important basis of value behind the
program, and you get for us as a company, why are we investing so much
into this program is not only having these skilled workers, it&#39;s
also we have customers in the food industry at the high end and there is
a certain qualities needed, and with this labor, with these skilled
workers we are able to provide the quality ?? well known around the
globe. Normally such a program starts in manufacturing as we are doing
in our company. You can multiply that. You can have the same structure
of this apprenticeship program also in other disciplines throughout the
company so I will always in the future also have a program for example
in engineering or in ?? I think the sky is the limit there. But I am
sure companies who are in investing in this long-term training will be
more successful than others here in North Carolina. If you&#39;d like to
know more about NC Tech, we are very open to talk with other employees
in North Carolina and support them, please go to the web page nctech.org
and you&#39;ll see a lot of information about the program. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay, thank you so much. Senator Rabin has a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On your line chart, the haystack chart. It really depicts the
gap between the workforce requirements in the education process. Is it
fair to say that the gap is created because of changing requirements,
because the requirements probably drive how close they can come to being
filled. I think to say there&#39;s an education gap is one thing, and to
see it is a very vivid description. But the cause and effect
relationship becomes less visible depending on how you think about those
lines. The way I visualize the lines and just tell me when I&#39;m
wrong, is that at least part of the reason for the line going up on
education and development and the line being down here on the job and
workforce needs, is created because the requirements aren&#39;t being
met not because the education isn&#39;t happening but perhaps in the
wrong disciplines. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think what we&#39;re seeing is
that as innovation over the last five, ten years or so is really just
going in leaps and bounds. It&#39;s exponential. And the education
system is good. It&#39;s just got to be a little bit more nimble, and
try to evolve at the pace of innovation and the pace of business. So the
kids are coming out and they&#39;re getting a good education but
there&#39;s a gap because the innovation and the technology is evolving
at a faster rate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions? One more
question, Senator Davis, and we need to go to our next speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thanks, Mr. Chair. I just had more brief, short questions
regarding the Andrews Aviation Academy, if that&#39;s possible. I was
just trying to get a feel for the number of students that are enrolled
and that typically graduate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do know it&#39;s a
hundred percent graduation, when they graduate. I think, I don&#39;t
have all the details on that because that was just presented a little
while ago. I&#39;d be happy to get them to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up Mr. Chair. If it&#39;s okay for time sake, we&#39;ll just speak
afterwards. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that&#39;d be fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much. Now we&#39;ll have Mary Phillips, Surrey County
Commissioner, talk about county economic development strategies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senators, ladies and gentlemen. He&#39;s
just going to set this PowerPoint up for me. And let me just say that a
year ago President Jeffers asked me to chair an economic development
task force. We&#39;ve seen the landscape changing and I

  With the rules center and a lot of changes in commerce in North
Carolina, and as County Commissioners, we certainly didn&#39;t want to
be behind the ball on that, as we find ourselves quite often on things
here in Raleigh.  But it was a great task force, there were 26 members
comprised of both rural and urban county representation.  We&#39;ve done
listening tours and I going to share with you six representations in
just a moment.  But to just give you a backdrop, but as a County
Commissioner, I come from a county that has lost 10,000 manufacturing
jobs the last decade.  Our per capita income, household income for
families is down $10,000.  If you took our county average median wage
and went to a bank and tried to secure a $120,000 mortgage at 4.25%
interest, the bank&#39;s going to tell you, sorry, you don&#39;t make
enough money.  And after 10 years of economic strategy, and development,
and incentives, and policy, we  have a flat tax base in Surry County, it
just simply hasn&#39;t worked.  So, as a County Commissioner, theories
are great, but what I look at is the bottom line and how it impacts the
citizens of Surry County, how it enables them to be able to move forward
with their lives, to be able to sustain their families, and that&#39;s
what I bring to the table in this discussion.
We looked at a lot of things, developing a strategic approach that&#39;s
easy to understand.  A lot of the times, one of the problems we saw with
counties, as well as the state is that you chase the wind, and when you
chase the wind you get nothing.  A county can not be everything to
everybody, we&#39;ve got certain skill sets, we&#39;ve got certain
strengths.  Every county has certain strengths and weaknesses, and
identifying those and then building the strategy around that, develop a
regional economic division.  We have some rural counties, Senator
Krawiec from Forsyth County is one of our neighbors, we have a good
partner there, Guilford County.  There are great things at PTI Airport,
there are great things in our urban counties and neighboring counties
that are important to us, and so we need those guys healthy and in turn
they need Surry County healthy.  Develop a collaborative mindset,
partnership, and county turf wars are in no one&#39;s best interests.  I
can assure you, an investor in West Germany this morning that&#39;s
looking at North America, he&#39;s probably not thinking the boundaries,
the county lines of Surry County.  He&#39;s thinking regional, he&#39;s
thinking Southeast, he&#39;s probably, maybe not even thinking about
state lines, for that matter.  And we&#39;ve come to an understanding
that bad public policy around economic development is just bad public
policy, regardless of which side of the political aisle it comes from.
When a family&#39;s struggling and people are hungry, it doesn&#39;t
matter where the help comes from, they&#39;re just wanting help and
they&#39;re wanting to move forward with their lives.
County incentive policies and guidelines should be flexible, but yet,
predictable, a lot of those include non-tax incentives, which may be
fees, regulatory fees.  Make counties business friendly, we&#39;re
currently, in Surry County, trying to look at combining our inspection
and permitting processing to streamline that, so we&#39;ve heard
feedback from our business community that said, you guys are not the
most business friendly county, and we&#39;ve listened and we&#39;re
making the appropriate changes.  Acknowledge and qualify value, required
deliverables that demonstrate progress assure citizens that the
investments are protected.  Which brings me to this point, the counties
need a tool to help calculate return on investment.  The Federal
Reserve, the Communities Affairs Unit used to have a CD that was
available to local governments and it&#39;s called FIT, F-I-T and
it&#39;s an acronym for physical impact tool, and it enabled local
governments to enter the data and actually see what economic development
policies would mean, how it would move the needles in counties.  A lot
of rural counties in North Carolina have no way of knowing, they hope
that it&#39;s going to work, they think it&#39;s going to work,
they&#39;ve been told to trust that it&#39;s going to work, but yet at
the end of the day, to have the solid evidence that says this is really
going to move the needle, this is going to expand the tax base, this is
going to create the opportunities and job opportunities your citizens
are looking for, that hard data is missing.  And as a new commissioner,
I&#39;ve only been a County Commissioner for three years so I bring
some, let&#39;s just cut through some smoke and mirrors to some realism,
guys, if it&#39;s not working, it&#39;s not working.  If it doesn&#39;t
expand the tax base, it&#39;s not working.  And so, at some point in
time, you can&#39;t just keep doing the same

  ...thing and say, &quot;well I hope we&#39;re gonna get it right - maybe
we&#39;re gonna get it right.&quot; Let&#39;s stop and say,
&quot;what&#39;re we doing? Why isn&#39;t it working? And what could we
be doing better with that?&quot; I think regionally, I highlight the
regional assets. When we market our counties, our rural counties, think
about Charlotte-Douglas Airport and the proximity to that. We think
about PTI. We think about Raleigh-Durham. The port systems not only in
North Carolina, but in South Carolina. Approach infrastructure
investments with a long term view. Water, sewer, and natural gas: those
are critical to having the kind of infrastructure in place that enables
- can make a county attractive to businesses. Access to capital. Convene
groups that can provide various kinds of small business assistance at
the local level. Consolidate resource information in one place online.
That would be a big key, and a big help for counties. Set up a revolving
loan fund for small businesses&#39; development or expansion.
Periodically request an open dialogue with representatives of the small
business community, and then strength of agro-business economy in rural
areas. Invite the federal and state agencies to educate citizens on
international markets for product. In Surry County exports is 15.4% of
our county GDP.  It&#39;s pretty amazing for a rural county that we
would have 15% of our county GDP in exports, but the possibility is
there. We found out in talking with counties that a lot of them are not
knowing that North Carolina has representation in foreign countries and
how those counties can get their footprint in their offices abroad and
be represented. Define and expand the role for the cooperative extension
and promote the expansion of the NCSU farm schools. The recent changes
in that, and I talked to the ?? county and explained why we were gonna
lose one office and I asked him how the formulas were calculated and he
said it was population. And I said well we were always going to lose
when that equation comes. And I said, &quot;Have you ever thought about
calculating something counties&#39; needs based on the percent of
agro-business?&quot; What it is is a percent of our county GDP, and they
hadn&#39;t thought of that. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll change that
anyway. Develop strategies to promote local agriculture growth with the
same urgency as manufacturing growth. That is a key and for a lot of
eastern counties especially that&#39;s a big key. Work force alignment
capacity. Promote apprenticeship programs. If you look at, and I agree
with the chamber that our skills gap in our workforce is critical. One
example that we found was if you look at BMW in Greenville, SC, the
workforce in creating that labor force actually begins in middle school.
Our public school systems are gonna have to recognize a need for
vocational training; that not everyone&#39;s going to go work at NASA,
but I paid a plumber $100 an hour two weeks ago and gentlemen that&#39;s
pretty good money where I come from. The skills, the workforce gap
skills, mean more than incentives. No company is going to come and
invest 30 or 40 million dollars in a county where the people can not
operate the machinery, and don&#39;t have the ability to operate it.
That is critical. Convene local forums to understand the gaps and the
workforce needs and availability. Develop strong working relationships
with the county EDP commissions and directors. I serve on the board of
our county economic development. Those relationships need to stay
healthy. They need to be maintained, and even though there is a lot of
change in Raleigh, it&#39;s important that the counties maintain - and
reach out and try to maintain - that healthy relationship with the
Department of Commerce here.

Mr. Phillips I&#39;m sorry to cut you off, but we only have 10 minutes
left. Any quick questions? We have one more speaker.

OK

Any other questions? OK.

Can I just say, Mr. Chairman, we&#39;ve got to give out these handouts -
notes. We are available at the Association County Commissioner I&#39;m
available for any questions you have after that.

OK. Our final speaker, Ronnie Goswick Franklin County Economic
Development Commission from Senator Barefoot&#39;s district.

  Summer Cruising was a program that we established several years ago to
help bridge the gap between what we’re teaching our kids and w hat we
actually need in the workforce area.  It was a program setup to bring
together teachers, superintendents, CT teachers, core teachers, guidance
counselors, community college presidents, county commissioners and
interested citizens to address the problem of the disconnect between
what we’re preparing our students for the future and what the real
future is.
Many of our participants were surprised to see what/how much of a gap
that was over the years.  Gone are the days that you could get an eighth
grade education and go to work at the cotton mill.  It’s going to take
at least two years of education beyond a high school diploma to do the
job that we’re trying to get our children to do.
That’s not to say that all of our kids need a four-year college
education (certainly that’s important), but a lot of our jobs, as Larry
mentioned, good jobs, can be had with a two year education.
The ability of our community college system to adapt as a valued partner
in this effort to attract industry to our state.  The Summer Cruising
program provided an eye opening experience for most of our participants.
 We encourage everyone to develop in the program to be aware of the
types of jobs that we need to prepare our students for.
As you sit here, Franklin Vance Warren ?? were the candidates that
participated in our Summer Cruising program.  It was a three day event.
The core teachers, guidance counselors, the career tech teachers and
support staff were part of our group.
The objective was to identify and visit emerging issues within the ??
regional council of government region to expose them to the types of
companies that are currently there.  Also to expose participants to
current market data and the qualification needed for entrance into this
workforce.  We also exposed participants to the emerging issues and
sustainable trends in industry, like Novozymes, houses North America and
centrally[?].  Exposed participants to the 21st century literacy skills,
strong academic skills, thinking, reasoning, teamwork and proficiency in
using technology.
We also encouraged our teachers to develop a career notebook or academic
plan, video clips and career resource material on the emerging issues in
our region.
I’d like to say that we have a very successful program.  These are a few
pictures of the participants -- we were on a bus together.  We had a
chance to interact with each other from all over our region.  So they
have a good background and some good contacts in the future.
This picture here was taken at Novozymes, North America, which is the
largest enzyme producer in North America, located in Franklin County.
They have worked closely with us.  When they first came here, we had
trouble finding people to work at Novozymes.  Novozymes donated the
equipment, the personnel and a lot of other costs, [coughs, excuse me]
to set up a program called Bio Works.  It grew into several more
programs throughout the state, and this program has been emulated all
over the state and the world.
This is a local company, CaptiveAire, a good corporate citizen there,
Bob Luddy started this company back in 1991.  It has grown tremendously.
 He is currently having, he’s developed plants all over the United
States and this one is his base headquarters.
Again, we’ve put them in the community college system where they’re
working with technology, and believe me, some of the young teachers and
the older teachers were about my age and we needed some exposure to
technology.
I’ll be glad to answer any questions you have.  Again, try to establish
a program that will allow you to train our teachers and make

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Teachers and our parents aware that you don&#39;t have
to have a four year college education to be successful. Larry mentioned
it and I think he was right, some great paying jobs out there with a two
year college education. I will mention a few more programs. Futures for
Kids is a great program to make kids aware, or students aware of
what&#39;s out there and what it&#39;s going to take to get into those
programs. North Carolina Works, the BioWorks program I mentioned, and
that is a certificate program. Again, Summer Cruising was great for us
and if you need any, have any questions or need additional follow-up
please, contact me in Franklin County. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have about two more minutes, any questions from the
committee? Senator Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure thank you for your presentation. The physical
facilities where you conduct this, is this at Vance-Granville Community
College or Wake Tech or do you have your own facilities there in
Granville County, Franklin County, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We-we&#39;ve spread it all over. We went to different
counties, Vance-Granville Community College was a major player. They
hosted most of the events. We went to different companies, so it&#39;s
a, it was just a sort of a shared, shared venue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Senator Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and thank you for the presentation. I
listened very carefully to your explanation of Summer Cruise and I think
it&#39;s a great program. But I didn&#39;t hear anything about
internships. I know a lot of times we&#39;ll have apprenticeships, but
many students need to earn money because, for whatever reason, to
supplement their family income, sometimes to supplement their own
income. So I think that would be helpful and do you have any such
programs that can provide pay for them while they&#39;re in school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We do not. We do provide some, some work for the
Workforce Development Board through our Kerr Tar Regional Council of
Governments. And we do provide funding for those, it&#39;s the, it&#39;s
a kids&#39; program. I can&#39;t think of the formal name of it, but
it&#39;s really, it provides them a chance to go out and work with
companies. One of the failings I think we have there is that it
doesn&#39;t put them in a position where they learn anything. We may
give them a broom and say sweep the floor, we may give them a-a chance
to interact a little bit with the companies but it needs to be more
in-depth and more challenging. There&#39;s an apprenticeship program in,
in Lee County with Caterpillar, great-great one to look at and we are
planning to do something similar to that in Franklin and Vance-Granville
and Warren County and Person.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you so much. Our time is up. Thank
everybody for coming, we&#39;re adjourned.
