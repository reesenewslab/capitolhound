Call the meeting to order please. While the other members are taking
their seats we will do the housekeeping or housecleaning, whichever it
may be.  Our pages this evening… Have our pages already checked in? Okay
yes you’re welcome. Our pages, Marika Samuelson from Selma representing
Senator Robinson. Alton Gaton, Riley, Senator Blue. Nichols Kroll, Holly
Springs, Senator Apodaca. I believe you were with us last year weren’t
you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Welcome back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And …
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Haley, yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to call for the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ayes and the nays.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [laughs] Thank you Senator.  I got the ?? in just a
second, Thank you.  Hey there ?? representing Senator Stein. Would you
like to vote in Senator Stein’s proxy tonight?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We will suspend the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Welcome.  AK Sergeant at arms staff is Steve McKregg,
Ernie Shell. Isaac Walker and Billy Citron.  Welcome. We welcome you
all. We have a few more members coming in if there’s anyone from the
public who cares to speak tonight if you would sign up please so that we
can call you forward. This evening’s agenda is going to be one bill only
and that is PCS of house bill 1224 and we will not vote this bill out
tonight but if we were I would have certainly gone ahead and voted it
Senator Stein. So it will be just for discussion but we would like to
hear from everyone and vet it firmly and hear from the public so if the
public would sign up please. Thank you.
We got a little hold up across the way.  I think someone told the
republican, the senate republican that it was raining and they’re trying
to figure out how to get over here but they will be here shortly so
we’ll just stand at ease until they get here.
Ladies and gentlemen we will come back to order now. Members of the
committee as I said earlier the only bill we have before us tonight is a
proposed committee substitute for house bill 1224. The chair will
entertain a motion to hear the proposed committee substitute.  All those
in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed? Okay. Senator Gun, PCS please for house bill
1224. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. This is just a very simple bill.
A lot of technical clarifying
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would be funny Josh you gotta laugh. Great to be here.
Let me start by… just to save time. The three job proponents of this
which had to do with JMack and the job CAD listing, JDig, remain the
same. If you have questions as we open up the dialogue we certainly will
try to answer those at that time but just so you know, I’m going to skip
that as far as any type of explanation. We have added as part of the PCS
what I think is a dynamic job creating part of this bill and it has to
do with crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is becoming a great mechanism to
raise private capital with a lot of people giving a little bit of money
and where this money is now being used is some of your startup
companies, your tech sector, research triangle areas, even your mom and
pop operations. It allows a small amount of money using security,
federal laws but relaxing those a little bit for your federal security
laws and what crowdfunding will do as a point of explanation is the
following…but I do really believe as we continue to look at job creating
legislation and also as we have discussed time and time again…</p>

initially, here's my constantly counting maybe equally concerned to

authority given for the purchase of respective counties awake during
norms to go out there and put up a long referendum.perhaps, in sales tax
from the majority done it. I gather from these proposal, we are okay and
we're premature are fine with what we've done, but as it relates to
weight County 's ability to do so at this time because we were all doing
this in partnership together what extent would they be in encounter
problems if they want to go out there and and into a half percent for
transit. right now it looks as if they would be inhibited from doing so
in less they give up one quarter percent, but the correctly from wrong.
maybe staff can help me with this not think Mister Doctor Marriott.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the way we have all order. this is lovely way to set super
centers at correct, they will have. they will have the option of either
going one half for transit. all they can do one half her education or
they can do a quarter quarter once comprises an education or they can go
to the component and although the general purpose as long as a type to
either catch us and myself, but it had been taught in either transit are
all education so I think your income on the development was taken off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think they will have these options available after product is under
the law weight is limited to only a half percent for transit, but under
the spell• is correct, it gives many options you enact a taxing quarter
increments up to half a quick follow him: what extent of it. they wanted
to take the full half retrieves it is time they had some boldly came

this body is going to consist of a software in the future. but when they
have the option of doing so,

Mister is a certain whether this bill dust cap of the local sales tax of

I nothing on that note, alternately writing the next sign up the back of

you want to speak on Lisa. I. frozen sign up good heart surgeon who
their next making sure no thanks are going on. try to grab my wrap my
mind around this bill, and these are my courses related and sales tax
component. I understand correctly in and maybe I misunderstood something
this good. it is this only limited to transit and or education, or is
there a component that would allow counties to raise sales tax for other
general purposes and is that what the question was before that,
regrettably, to finance the past recipients. if you're at the two
percent you have you have the ultra has all education a combination of
those and you can also combine the purpose with that as long as you
taught me the trash transit or education. if you already have a weblog
use the twenty seven counties. oddly, that abused the quarter for
general purpose you will have a quarter available for either transit or
education follow-up things turn up in this. this is a good piece that
big concerns me. what I understand counties like Mecklenburg and
anti-Semitism that would wake in the triangle area. no concerns about
transportation and I think the writers room is familiar with the
dynamics on the local level as it relates to education, but I'm I'm what
where or where is this coming from the that it would be needed or

<p id="25:00">
We're not, we're not raising taxes. You have the authority now to go to
two and a half percent, so lets make sure that we get that clear. This
is just, really bringing everybody up to the level, to a level playing
field. Make it universal so everybody has these options. As far as your
questioning goes and the way that we have spelled out the, give the
flexibility, you know, quite honestly, we've had a lot of folks that had
a little bit of concern over, I think, matter of fact, I think our
[00:32 sold in the federal reserve ? ], they have concern about raising
property taxes. And they wanted to because, you know, they're hurting
now and it may be another deal killer and make them not competitive.
This gives options for counties to decide what is important relative to
education.  Everything we're hearing is; how can we on a state and a
local level, better, not only with policy but with funding and that's
where we'll continue to have the dialogue. But, I think the locals would
like to have these opportunities and flexibilities. And that's the basis
as I see it for how we've structured this deal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Newton, you know, right now,
article forty-six was part of the medicaid swap is been utilized by
twenty-seven counties. Some of them beyond that have failed. That was a
general appropious use type of deal. The, there is for other than the
six major urban counties, there is a half cent sales tax on transit that
has been not utilized because they have no way of using that money in
the manner described. And all this really does is it basically gives
them an opportunity on that one quarter cent, to use it on education, on
transit, or on the general use. So it basically allows them to be able
to have a chance to stay within the cap. This is not a tax increase in
any way of thinking, but it does give the counties an opportunity to
meet their priorities based on what their county commissioners feel is
necessary and that's why it was brought forward in this manner. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Follow up Senator Rabin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
understand. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would, if I could just make a
really quick comment on that. You know, back home, my county defeated
the sales tax increase some years ago and as an observation, it was
because the county wanted to pretend like they were gonna do it for
education, but they wouldn't promise that it would be only spent on
education. And, so I have a lot of concerns about this general provision
because I can wrap my mind around this, this is a dedicated
authorization to increase the sales tax to the current cap for education
or just for transportation. But, you know, well whatever, we just want
to raise the tax. That's where I have a major concern and that's just
what my personal feelings on the subject are. And I understand about the
two and a half percent that, that authority was already there for
transit that most counties don't need because they don't have the Wake
county or the Charlotte Mech situation. But, I kind of like to see it
limited to education except for these metropolitan areas. That would be
my personal choice. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Senator Blue, just a moment.
You're, Senator Stein is next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Seventy-three counties right now are at two percent and they want to go
to two and a quarter for general purposes, some economic development
purpose. Why are you restricting the flexibility of counties,
seventy-three counties around the state, saying that you have to go to
two and a half percent when they may only want to go to two and a
quarter and they may only have the capacity to go to two and a quarter?
Why are you trying to hands the counties in this way? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, would you like to? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It was trying to
just get folks moving to the point where they can and as we, I'm sorry,
I can't see you, and as we move forward on tax reform in the fifteen and
sixteen years, it'll give us a chance to better determine what amount of
money they would receive as a broaden sales tax base goes in to place,
Senator Stein. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm
sorry. I have a follow up question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh okay. I didn't
get your nod. Go ahead Senator Stein. Senator Blue, wait another moment
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just trying to process that in a way
that made sense. I'm still working on it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you
like for Senator Blue to ask his question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, my

Points that are on the local option or the half point to the local
option is something that’s consistent, that will allow us to move
forward and if this General Assembly believes in the long-run as we were
to broaden the sales tax base on goods and services sometime in the
future. A half a point for Wake county or Mecklenburg county or any of
the others, would be a significantly higher because you broaden your

reached set out that they would do.  They too, or we too, would be
precluded from imposing a quarter cent sales tax if we wanted to do that
to improve teacher salaries or public education.  I think you would
agree with that, but I have a technical question for the staff, Mr.
Chairman. Is there any Constitutional constraint, I know there’s
several, but does any Constitutional restraint readily come to mind that
would prevent any other General Assembly from singling out Wake county?
Whether we do the false things population or otherwise?  Empowering the
citizens of this county and imposing this additional tax responsibility
upon themselves if they chose to.  That is, is there anything that would
restrict the General Assembly from empowering a county to do that?  A
single county, not the broader bases we have here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I assume we have ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, I’m not aware of any Constitutional constraint, I think
that the counties are creatures of the state and the General Assembly.
There’s no requirement that even the General Assembly give all of them
equal taxing authority. And so a future General Assembly could certainly
opt to give Wake county different taxing authority if it so chose to do
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Sanderson. And then Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This question kind of goes to the Article 46
tax. A little bit more explanation, if a county is currently planning on
putting a quarter cent tax under Article 46 on the November ballot, how
would that play out as far as the other quarter cent they have left
remaining after January 1st, 2015?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, do you care to answer that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure I quite follow that so say it again if you don’t mind?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff I believe can handle that if you’re wiggling your microphone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So for the counties that have approved to put this issue on the November
2014 ballot, they would not be required to also enact the quarter cent
for education or for transportation.  So if they want to proceed with
just the Article 46 general purpose tax and they’ve already got it on
their ballot then they can proceed with that.  If you’re a county that’s
already at 2.5% you would not be able to hold a referendum on this issue
because that would put you over that 2.5% cap.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If that same county that elects and it passes referendum to add that
quarter cent sales tax this November, what would be their options with
the remaining quarter cent after November? Could they go back and pass
that by referendum and designate it to education or transport?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They could.  They would receive, they could do a quarter cent for
education or transportation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I think we need to talk about a little history on
why we got to where we’re at today a little bit and a lot of that was
because we had several local bills, one of them being mine, that had
some concerns about the rate that property taxes were being increased in
our counties and felt like a sales tax was a fairer tax, or revenue
source than property tax. And I’m one of the 27 counties in Onslow that
happens to have passed the quarter cent which can be used for any
purpose basically, and I’ve got one that hasn’t. So I’ve got two
scenarios.  I’ve got one that’s at 2% and one that’s at 2 and a quarter
percent now.  What this will allow my two counties to do is to my
understanding is Onslow county could run a new referendum to raise a
quarter cent tax that could be used for education or transportation
because it has.</p>

Tax referendum, as opposed to bond referendum based on taxes. Sales tax
referendum is due to a particular projects or authorizing locals to do
that. Anybody look at that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Did we know?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Second question, in what way if any, does any of this effect the stream
line sales tax arrangement?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
It doesn't have any effect on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any other members of the committee? If not, we have two members of the
public that would like to speak. Before, I call them forward, the first
one will be Joanna Reece of the North Carolina Association of County
Commissioners, if she'll please approach the microphone. But, before you
do I'd like to recognize, please, Mr. Jerry Cohen for his 37 years of
service to this body. This may be one of the last finance committee
meetings that he is in attendance as an employee. I'm hoping he'll be
here many, many times as a member of the public. Jerry, thank you for
your years, and service, and all you've done. This building will have a
large void in it when you leave. Thank you.
[Applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
It will only be my last meeting if you'll stop doing that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Oh, that's what I meant. Thank you so much, Jerry. Miss Reece, if you'll
come forward please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm Joanna Reece, with the Association of
County Commissioners, and we do appreciate that the committee did hear
some of our concerns regarding the lack of flexibility in a previous
version of the bill from last week. This PCS does, partially, address
those concerns. That there is still some limitations on the flexibility
in the current version. We do still have some concerns about the 2.5%
cap, but largely it is a good piece of legislation. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Miss Reece. We have from the league, Miss Erin ??. Miss ??,
welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I'm
Erin ??, I'm the League of Municipalities Legislative and Regulatory
issues manager. I'm really excited that the committee has chosen to
address this topic in an economic development bill. Because, ultimately,
at the end of the day we do believer there is a larger discussion that
needs to happen regarding the respective roles of the state and the two
levels of local government, with respect to economic development. Of
course, recruiting employers is one piece of that puzzle. Education, and
training workers, providing means to get to jobs, roads, and other
transportation infrastructure. The underground infrastructure that's
provided, the water in waste water services, rehabilitation of old
buildings, and providing attractive places for these workers to live.
All of that is part of our state's economic development puzzle and there
is a role for us to be talking about how financing tools can be geared
towards providing the means for local communities to bring in jobs.
However, we don't believe that this bill goes far enough in terms of
giving that flexibility to local communities to determine what's best
for them. There are restrictions in this bill on the ways that these
local revenues can be used, the restrictions on which the purposes of
the revenues that are raised can be spent, an explicit cap on those
revenues that are raised, as well as the amounts those levees can take
place in. Further, the bill ignores half of the equation when we're
talking about local government. Economic development, it does deal with
counties, it does not deal with municipal role. Therefore, we believe
that this concept is just not yet ripe. It is the end of session to be
taking on really big topic and we would urge the committee to consider
studying it, rather than proceeding forward with this particular
proposal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Thank you, so much. Members, I'll remind you that session is
at 6:30. I would like to thank our pages and especially, Mr. Holberg.
You certainly did a lot of work tonight around the back of the room.
Thank you, so much. We thank our Sergent at Arms. Meeting is adjourned.</p>
