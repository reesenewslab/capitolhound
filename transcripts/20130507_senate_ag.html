In order now that Senator Cook is here. ?? yesterday, Kate Lee Johnson,
from Kipling. We have Brendon O’Dell from Spring Lake. Chad Lee from
Greensboro. Evan McDowell from ??. And from Brown Summit Travis Watts.
Thank y'all for being here and I hope y'all learning something, and have
fun today. And please come back and some of the seats from some of the
people we have in here now. That would be much appreciated, including
mine. Our Sargent of Arms that are here today. Charles is coming in, Ron
was here. And who else was here? OK we're good. First we're gonna move
the agenda around a little bit today, cuz I know we have members that
have bill's in other committees. First we have Senate bill 638 the North
Carolina farm act of 2013, with Senator Jackson. This is a proposed
committee substitute. Senator Jackson moves for adoptions. All those in
favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye (group)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed no. Ayes have it. Senator Jackson the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Good morning members and guests. Senate bill 638
the North Carolina farm act of 2013 is sort of a copulation of many
things, there's a lot of moving parts in this bill. If you'll read your
bill summary it's very accurate in describing what is in this bill, and
I'm gonna try and highlight some of the things. Actually section one of
course is just the informal title. Section two and section three sorta
eases some of the worry and concerns that have been going on with the
petting zoos, animal rides, and educational programs using animals and
their curriculum. It sort of addresses some of the concerns to allow
these petting zoos and so forth at state fairs and festivals, and
private operations, special ?? Tourism. It gives them a little
flexibility and allows them to continue to do that without trying to
have so many problems. Section four gives the North Carolina Department
of Agriculture board’s commissions and officials with the authority to
assess civil penalties but also to assess non-voluntary penalties when
it is appropriate to do so. I found it right ironic that you have to
have a measure to not assess a monetary penalty. So this sorta gives the
board of agriculture, and these commissions the opportunity to assist
someone instead of just fining em. And I think that is a great thing.
Section number five decreases the frequencies of the survey of persons
who withdraw 10,000 gallons per day for agricultural purposes from
annually to bi-annually. And this came from a recommendation from ?? and
also the water group that's been working trying to resolve some of the
water issues across the state. And basically it takes it from a one year
to every two years because they pretty much collected the data they
need, from the understanding I'm getting. Section number six provides
that no information collected by the Department of Agriculture for its
animal health programs, including certificates of veterinarian
inspections, animal medical records, laboratory reports, or other
information may identify a person or private business subject to
regulation by the department, may be disclosed without the permission of
the owner unless the state veterinarian determines that the disclosure
is necessary to prevent the spread of an animal diseases to maintain
public health, or to implement animal health programs. What this bill
basically, section basically does is it makes it so that every Tom,
Dick, and Harry can not just go in and request through the freedom of
information act for the state veterinarians office, and through the
Department of Agriculture. Because sometimes this priority information.
And unless it affects the public health, or the animal industry as a
whole those of course would not apply if it did those two things, but
otherwise it puts a little restrictions on who can have that
information. Section number seven repeals the interstate test control
compact article 4E of chapter 106 of the general statutes. The
Department of Agriculture has asked that we repeal this language because
the IPCC was formed as an interstate compact in 1968 but has not been
active in recent years. And earlier this year they chose to dissolve
because of an issue with IPCC's tax exempt status. So they've already</p>

…this they just need the authority to do so. Sections eight and nine
repeals general statues 106 246 and which set… 248…which set out
cleanliness and purity standards for ice cream plants, creameries and
cheese factories. Now, we’re not going to say you’re going to have dirty
factories so let me continue before we get too…our hairs raised too
high. The department of agriculture has asked us to repeal these statues
as they have been rendered obsolete by the North Carolina Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, which prohibits adulterated food from being entered into
commerce at general statute 106 129, so the North Carolina Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act covers what this was doing originally. In 2011, House
bill 119 became sectional 2011 dash 394 and changed the setback distance
and burn times for debris, stumps, brush or other flammable materials
resulting from ground clearing activities. We found that the language
does not conform with these changes and this language in section ten
brings our general statues up to date to get it to conform to that.
Section 11 repeals general statute 119 26 dot 2, which provides self or
content standards in gasoline. The department of agriculture has asked
that we repeal this section because it was adopted prior to the problem
? EPA standards, in other words,  EPA doesn’t require it so we don’t
have it either. Section number 12 exempts migrant housing from
requirements for installation of and automatic sprinkler system if the
building meets certain requirements are met. A sprinkler system using
water from a well requires a holding tank, chemicals to keep that water
from going stale and an expulsion system.  All of these are costly and
the federal occupational safety and health administration regulations
for temporary labor camps do not.. do not require a sprinkler system and
the state requirements of the migrant housing act of North Carolina does
not also require a sprinkler system. Both of those regulatory bodies
have been placed codes to make sure egress’ fire extinguisher, living
space are all included. In order to be exempt from the sprinkler system,
the building must do the following: be one floor, meet all the federal
occupational, safety and health administration regulations  for
temporary labor camps and 3) meet all the migrant housing acts of North
Carolina. This has become an issue in trying to build new labor camps
with the costs being anywhere being from 75 hundred upwards to the 20
thousands range plus to maintain these systems every year on private
wells with the tanks and as I said earlier none of the other agencies
require this. OSHA does not require this neither does our north client
migrant housing authority. Section number 12 also allows a farm building
that is used for public or private events , such as weddings, receptions
or meetings to maintain its farm building status for the purposes of the
state building code. Currently farm building located outside the
building rules jurisdiction of any municipality are exempt from state
building rules. We have worked with the depart of agriculture on this
section because currently there is uncertainty and confusion among
agriturlism farms operators about permissional uses of farm building for
exhibitions and events where the public is invited into a building.
That, originally, was exempt from the building code when constructed
because it was farm building. This will allow folks in agriturlism
industry to still be exempt as a farm just because they are entertaining
and rental out that facility several times a year or even maybe one time
a year but it provides some language clarification that has been grey in
the past. Sections 13-1 and 13-2 amends the definition of waters under
the environmental statues to include only those wet lands or waters of
the United States and would revive that a water quality permit would not
be required for activities in wet lands that are not waters of the
United States. This language modifies the definition adopted for
isolated wet lands by the environmental management commission found in
general statue 143 dash 2 12 6. This does not alter the purpose or the
requirement of the federal wet land program. This language keeps farmers
from having their isolated irrigation ponds from becoming wet lands and
needs permits for build.</p>

Section 14 provides that the current exemptions from the dam safety act
of dams constructed to provide water for agriculture use that were
designed and constructed by or under the supervision of a person who is
employed by the natural resource conservation service, county or local
soil and water conservation districts, and has, and this is key, and has
federal engineering job approval, authority under chapter 89C of the
general statutes. We've worked with farm bureau and DENR on this
language. This idea is to give farmers more options when constructing
and repairing a dam used for water on their farm. These additional
options are also authorized by the federal engineering job approval
authority. Section 15 provides that nothing in this statute governing
water shortages, emergencies can limit a landowner from withdrawing
water for use in agricultural activities when the water is withdrawn
from surface water sources located wholly on the landowner's property
and from groundwater sources. The goal of this language is to make sure
that the water on a farmer's land does not hinder a neighboring property
owner and can be used at the discretion of the farmer. Section 16-1 and
2 directs the department of DENR, department of environment and natural
resources, and the department of transportation to jointly petition the
United States army corp of engineers to allow for greater flexibility
and opportunity to perform wetland mitigations outside out of the
watershed where development occurs. Also DENR and DOT will report on the
progress in petitioning the corps to the environmental review commission
no later than January 1, 2014. And that basically, is sort of
encouraging them to work together. I would be happy to entertain the
questions. I have staff on standby, if I can't answer them. But I've
tried to give you a true picture of what this bill does. I've tried to
be transparent in my presentation of it. And I'll answer your questions,
if there is any. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Jackson, I think
you get an honorable nomination for ??. But you have been very
transparent. In fact you went through it verbatim. Any questions from
the committee? Senator Alran. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill has a lot of
stuff in it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I missed
about the first minute or so, so forgive me if I missed that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You didn't miss anything. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay,
thank you for clarifying that. The question I had is in regard to the
farm animal activities. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will that have any affect on the petting zoos and the zoos we have at
the state fair and the petting zoos that are at various places around
the state and that liability from the e coli and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it gives them a little leeway in that area,
because if not we're going to lose those petting zoos and those
activities that you see at state fairs and festivals and staff might
want to address that a little more if we need to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm
particularly interested, and if you have those, I think there's, zoos
are great but if you got a whole bunch of people infected with e coli,
I'm just wondering about the, from a health standpoint and limiting
liability and all of that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Alran. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. So
what this bill would do is list under on page 5, line 14, it lists the
risk of contracting an illness as an inherent risk of farm animal
activities. And then a farm activity sponsor or professional has
protection from liability for death or injury caused by the inherent
risks of farm animal activities. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could follow up.
I just ask the question, is this in my head, so will this make the
people who have the zoos less likely to be, to keep them clean? So that
we're more likely to have, you know, 100, 200, 300 people at the state
fair or anyplace else, infected with e coli? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair. The intent of this bill is not to do that. And I don't think we
have put language in there to make sure that they do still maintain the
best sanitation methods that they can and good</p>

The penalties associated with the possession or sale or possession for
sale or purchase of wildlife would be punishable by a fine not less than
$250 that stays as class 2 misdemeanor but under current law, there is
no specific fine amounts provided. The next is penalty associated with
unlawful sale, possession for sale or purchase of deer or wild turkey to
specify that the violation is punishable by a fine not less than $500,
still a class two misdemeanor but there was no minimum amount under
current law. The next is penalty associated with unlawful taking
possession or transportation of deer, to specify the violation is
punishable by a fine not less than $250, it is still a class three
misdemeanor but the minimum amount under current law was $100. The next
is a penalty associated with unlawful taking deer between half hour
after sunset and a half hour before sunrise with the aid of artificial
light and it now states that the violation would be punishable by a fine
not less than $500, it is still a class two misdemeanor but the minimum
amount under current law is $250. The next is a penalty associated with
Berries prohibition on taking permits and tagging rules pertaining to
migratory game birds and specifies that the violations are punishable by
a fine not less than $250, still a class 2 misdemeanor as under the
existing law but the minimum fine under the existing law was $100. The
next is a penalty associated with unlawful taking of black bears with
the use and aid of bait would state that the fine would be not less than
$250 for violation, still a class two misdemeanor but there was no
minimum penalty specified under the statues. The next is a penalty
associated with unlawful removal of feral swines from a trap. This
violation would be punishable by a fine not less than $250, it's still a
class two misdemeanor but there was no minimum penalty amount. And then
there are two new separate extinct violations that are created under the
bill and that would be unlawful taking possession and transportation of
Elk from state on land which would be punishable by a class 1
misdemeanor with a fine not less than $2500. The next is unlawful taking
possession or transportation of deer from properly posted land without
written permission from their land owner or their agent which would be
class 2 misdemeanor with a fine of not less than $500. That's it Mr.

also be some savings. I am associated with the energy and defense

Senator Mckissick, the floor is yours.

Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is a pretty straight forward bill. All we

The Chairman: Senator Wade.
Senator Wade: Senator McKissick, I see that where an animal's
surrendered to a shelter by an owner, that they can go ahead and waive
the waiting period and have the pet euthanized or adopted, or whatever
they decide to do, is that correct?
Senator McKissick: That's correct. I believe there is a 72-hour window
that's applicable.
Senator Wade: My question is, when they surrender the pet, are they
still required to mention whether this pet has bitten anyone, or is up
to date on its rabies vaccine, or, all those things need to be taken
into consideration. So is there another law that applies to that, if
you're surrendering your pet and you're waiving your right to hold this
pet?
Senator McKissick: I'm not aware of other laws that address that
specifically. This would address any situation when an owner would bring
a pet to a shelter. It would also address these pets that are picked up
there, just kind of roaming out in the county, that people don't know
the histories of, which are probably at greater risk. They do very
thorough inspection, and it does allow, under circumstances where a
shelter determines that a pet is unhealthy or not fit for adoption, to
go ahead and proceed with euthanizing that particular animal.
The Chairman: Senator Wade.
Senator Wade: Followup on that is, sometimes we have problems with pets
biting members of the family, or a stray dog come into the yard that
they've been feeding for a day or two and it bites a member, and they
might go down to the shelter and relinquish the pet, and it's okay to go
ahead and euthanize this pet, but I think we have to have, somewhere in
here, that you need to say whether this pet's bitten someone, because
that's going to leave us pretty open there, and that does happen quite
often.
Senator McKissick: Sure. And that's an excellent observation. What we
can do is this, I will check with those that are more familiar with the
details of what questions they're asked when these pets are surrendered,
to see if that is, in fact, being done today, but if it's not being
done, I certainly would be open to a friendly amendment that we could
run on the floor.
Senator Wade: I have another followup. The other thing is, with the
photo ID, now, I've had this problem happen with some of my clients who
go down to pick their pet up that might have come from the shelter, some
reasonable excuse for getting out of the fence, for some reason, the pet
got under the fence, and they go to pick their pet up, and it was signed
out originally from the shelter in the husband's name, and the wife goes
to get the pet, and they're not able to pick the pet up. They have to
call the husband at work and have him come, because of the ID
requirement. Have you addressed that in some way, because I've had that
happen about five or six times in my office in the last year?
Senator McKissick: This is impacting situations where a pet's being
adopted. So if the rightful owner is going for it, I assume it's not an
adoption occurring, but again, we can certainly raise that with the
Department and see if we need to, perhaps, even though it's not the
focus of the bill, I don't have any objections to including something
like that if it's in an appropriate location, to insert it and there's
not something that addresses it today. So we'll follow up on that as it
moves to the floor. Thank you.
The Chairman: Senator Wade.
Senator Wade: I know it says that you have 72 hours to reclaim your pet,
but it also says in here that the shelter has to be open at least four
hours a day, three days a week. So what if your dog comes in on Monday,
the shelter closes for the next three days. So is it working days?
Somehow shelters aren't open all the time, so when you say 72 hours, how
long do the people really have if the shelter's closed for three days,
and their 72 hours is expired before they've even had that chance?
Senator McKissick: It's my understanding, based upon the way they've
been operating, they do have to hold the pet a minimum of 72 hours. Now
whether they're counting weekend days or not, as I say, we're
re-codifying a lot of existing law that was on the books previously. I
believe they are looking at the actual number of days they are in
operation, but we can certainly seek some clarification. But the main
thing we were doing in terms of carrying it over was making certain we
had a division in entity in charge of these rules and regulations that
is accustomed to handling animal welfare issues, which is what we have
in Department of Agriculture. They have an animal welfare section. So
it's better that they get involved in monitoring these things and
handling them, and of course the other provision that we've talked about
already dealing with institutional sales that...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any more follow up?
Sen. Wade will cross examine your bill after we get through this
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of committee, what's your pleasure?
Any comments from the audience?
Don't see anything.
Sen. Kinnear moves for a favorable report.
Sen. Bingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was just gonna say, we'd fix it, Sen. Wade seemed to have a  lot of
concerns, but
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But we'll do
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But we can move it on and we'll fix it before it gets to floor. We can
address- some of those may already be addressed. And then they are
outside the scope of the bill. But if they are not, we're open to doing
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick, we're coming back on Thursday to have another ag
meeting, so why don't we just go ahead and clean it up here before we
send it out to the floor. I just make sure we won't stay too long out on
the floor. It'll get fixed, we'll get through it til Thursday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I mean if we could go ahead and move it, I'd think these had
already been addressed to be completely candid with you. These outside
the scope of the actual bill. But it'll help us move it along, I can
promise you there won't be any problem with that. Are you okay with that
Sen. Wade?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Wade?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I think it would be better if we clean up some of these
issues before we voted on it in the committee
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll that'd be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
so we'll have another chance if- and I could get with Sen. McKissick and
tell him some...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Kinnaird withdraws her motion. We'll just get it cleaned before we
send it off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That'll be-

We'll put in a homo sapien provision.
Okay, Sen. McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He'll be back for another show on Thursday.
Next up, we have House bill 484, permitting of wind energy facilities,
and we're gonna try to go through 689 toward the end, and I know we have
a lot of people to speak for and against it. What I may do is try to do
a minute each, for each person who wants to speak on it. Any of your
comments maybe try to bring up something that hasn't been said by a
previous speaker, but you'll identify yourselves, where you're from, who
you're representing when you get to it. But currently we have 484,
permitting of wind energy facilities.
Rep. Bell. The House bill.
The floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Thank you for allowing us to be here today. House bill 484, permitting
of wind energy facilities. This bill will establish a permitting program
for deciding an operation of wind energy facilities in the state of
North Carolina. The program will be implemented by the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources, and this is also the companion bill
with House bill 491 introduced by Sen. Harry Brown. This bill crossed
the House, crossed over from the House with 112 to 2 support, went
through judiciary committees, went through environmental, went through-
excuse me, did not go through judiciary, went through environmental,
public utilities and finance, and received favorable reports in all the
committees of ?? the floor. This bill is not against potential
development of wind energy, it develops the permitting process for wind
energy at the same time while protecting the continuation and expansion
of our vital military operation here in the state of North Carolina.
Currently the military is the second largest contributor to our state's
economy, providing roughly a $26 billion economic impact annually, and
business performing defense related contracts are currently in 80 of our
100 counties here in North Carolina. Wind farm encroachment in military
airspace, turning operations in radar installations is a critical issue
that threatens the long term viability of our military in North
Carolina. Incompatible encroachment in turning operations diversely
affects the military mission and increases the risk of future base
closures and realignment and as we all know, Brack is just right around
the corner. Currently there's a regulatory gap here in the state. The
regulatory gap exists between the Federal Aviation Administration's
review of wind energy facilities' impact on civil aviation, and the
Dept. of Defense's review on impact of wind energy project on board
issues of National Security. What we found out during this legislation
is that the FAA and the DOD actually have no authority to turn down a
project, especially when it deals with our military interests. The Dept.
of Defense can only rule if it's in threat of homeland security. So just
because a wind turbine intrudes on our military airspace doesn't mean
it's a threat to national security, it just means that it's a threat to
training. So they can up and move our military training installations,
especially the ones we currently have. The problem exists with
encroachment, and if you look on the maps that  are on the sides, I will
show you just with the powerpoint, the yellow</p>

<p id="45:00">
Process but we have agreed that we’re not going to oppose a state level
process to deal with that also.  The things we’re concerned about is the
duplication of regulation that’s in this bill. There are several aspects
of state and federal environmental permitting that we already have to go
through under existing law. Now we’re going to have to go through them
again if this bill passes in its current form. There are also several
requirements in there that repeat local zoning regulations.  Almost
every county where wind projects are being located have local zoning
ordinances dealing with noise and shadow flicker and alerting the
adjoining land owners.  And then finally, there’s one technical aspect.
One of the things we’ve asked all along in this bill is that the state
process be early in the game because we you’re looking at the kinds of
investments that we’re talking about, a developer’s not going to risk
the capital of going through a multi-year process that may result in the
state denying a permit. So we’ve asked that the DENR permit be moved to
the front. That was done partially, one of the things we’re still
concerned about in the bill is that DENR can withhold its grant of a
permit until you finish the federal process. To sum all that up, we’re
supportive of what the bill sponsors are doing with the military.
There’s no way we could come in and preach economic development if we
were going to do something that damaged military communities and
industries in North Carolina. These projects are not going to get built
that interfere with them. But the uncertainty that exists because of the
overregulation in the environmental area is going to prevent these
companies from looking at North Carolina and we’d  appreciate any help
we can get in terms of making those modifications and hopefully by the
time this bill becomes law it’ll be one that we can support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  ?? ?? from DENR.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to start out by just broadly
supporting the bill but I think I need to respond to some of the
criticisms from Mr. Thompson.  As I believe a lot of Senators in the
room and Representatives are aware we’ve had extensive meetings with the
wind industry and we’ve repeatedly heard these same criticisms of
duplication of federal and local requirements.  And we have had a lot of
difficulty finding concrete examples of the duplication. I think if you
listened to Mr. Thompson’s words carefully he said, almost every local
jurisdiction. And that’s a key distinction I’d like to point out. Not
all local areas have regulations concerning wind turbine.  So what we’re
trying to do here is to make sure we don’t have a repeat of what
happened in western North Carolina that led to the adoption of the RICH
law. We embrace wind companies, we want them to come here. I think that
Mr. Thompson’s point about them coming into rural counties is especially
important.  These are major economic developmental opportunities.  Our
department is entirely in support of that, we want to encourage it. But
at the same time we want to make sure that both the military and
environmental concerns are addressed and not just the military issues.
If we had a bad project just like that 12 story building out near Sugar
Mountain, if we have one bad project we’re not going to have another
wind turbine built in the state.  We would like to see very good
responsible projects, we’ve designed a process where we try and meet
upfront and talk about military issues, environmental issues and
potentially local issues such as siding wind turbines too close to the
houses people occupy. So what we’re trying to do here with this
legislation is come up with something that’s rational, brings the right
people to the table that?? the process, deals with the problems and
allows us to move forward and give the billions of dollars of
development income that Mr. Thompson was talking about into these areas.
 And so the department is entirely in support of this bill as written
and we don’t think it needs any amendments.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to touch on the economic impact, the ?? project which is the one
that’s listed up there in Beaufort County and also adds two and a half
jobs. What’s at stake on that project alone? Would have the possibility
of shutting down Seymour Johnson which brings in a $527 million impact.
And then when you go through active duty reservice and a
non-appropriated funds personnel you’re looking at a total of 12, 478
jobs.  So if you’re looking at a detrimental economic impact, that is
just int eh surrounding area with one air force base. That does not
include Cherry Point down in Havelock.

Thank you. Just real quick on the military prerogatives and all of that.
I'm glad that you brought up the ?? range things in this area, but we
have to recognize I think in this state we have a lot of special
operations going on that are classified. So the answer to some of the
question is, you're not gonna know ahead of time and that's why the
department, the DOD representatives have to be involved in the decision
process, because they're the only ones who know which land is being used
and whether they're doing clandestine or semi-clandestine training and
be ready to adjust to it without regard to the open things that are
going on there on the East coast. It's just something to keep in the
back of your mind when you're going through this stuff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not trying to, my questions were not designed to throttle back the
bill or anything. They were designed to say, to ask the very specific
question, if we are creating a state wide scheme for this kind of
regulation, should we not also say that that state wide scheme is
preemptive of local regulations that are inconsistent with the state
wide scheme. That's, that's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just suggest that the answer to that would, should be no,
because they might want to be more restrictive on the local level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But we just adopted regulations, or just adopted a bill yesterday that
said that we couldn't have more restrictive legislation. That's, ??
that's why.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it doesn't necessarily pertain to this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Allran. Senator Allran's right. When you're looking at
the federal regulations that are passed down some, the regulations that
we took care of, and legislation the other day did not pertain to air
space. And I'll say this as a family member of a former Air Force pilot,
probably one of the best in the Air Force. Anything that we do that
harms our, harms us in as far as BRAC and realignment closing, we're
looking at losing twelve thousand jobs at Seymour-Johnson. I think it
said ??, take a look at what we've got to make sure we protect our air
space for our pilots and, and so Representative Whitmire's talked about
that you don't have a lot of room, there is not a lot of room out there
when you're flying those jets, so I think the bill will protect that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But, mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's not the point. If the local activity causes the problem, we don't
want that, and what we have in the bill at present is we're not
precluding the locals from doing something that does something more. And
that's my concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, I know that's one thing. We'll take a look at commerce and
finance to make sure it goes through. Senator Wade? We're gonna take a
vote on this bill. Is there a motion for it? Senator Barefoot moves that
we favorable to House bill 484. All those in favor will say aye.
