I'd like to welcome all of you to the Committee on Regulatory Reform.
Today our House Sergeant of Arms are Fred Hines, Reggie Seals, John
Brandon. Where are you, John? Behind me? There you go. And Michael
Clampett. Our Pages today, if you would stand when I call your name.
Jeff Woodard from Wake County. Representative Murry sponsored him. Sarah
Jackson from Vance, Representative Baskerville. Sarah Horn from Haywood,
Representative Ramsey. Garrett Weiz from Cleveland, sponsored by
Representative Moore. Isabelle Hines from Wake, sponsored by
Representative Fulghum. And Destiny Reid from Alamance, sponsored by
Representative Riddell. I'd like to welcome you to the Body this week,
and I certainly hope that you'll learn something at today's meeting.
Members, the Committee on Regulatory Reform could perhaps be one of the
most important committees that you'll serve on in this biennium session.
All of us have suffered under the rules that have been promulgated as
well as our state agencies. And we've also benefited from the rules that
have been promulgated here as well as our state agencies. The goal of
this committee is really two-fold. We will address regulatory reform in
a one-or two-up manner. What I mean by that is, there are a number of
members that have come to me already with bills seeking to address one
or two trees in the landscape or the forest of the regulatory
environment. And we will address those trees. We will decide whether to
feed them, whether to prune them, or whether to cut them down. But we
also want to take a look at the forest. We want to look at the
Administrative Procedures Act, and we want to make sure that rule making
in the state of North Caroline is done in the most transparent,
rigorous, fully-vetting way that our citizens expect. Because any rule
or regulation puts at threat our property and our liberty. And it's
something that we cannot take lightly. I expect us to work hard. We'll
work many hours. But I expect the outcome to be something that the
business community will appreciate, and more importantly, our citizens
of our state. I look forward to working with you. Today let me introduce
our staff. We have Karen Cochran-Brown, who is pretty much seen as the
resident expert when it comes to regulatory conform. One thing that
you'll learn today is that there are a lot of semantics. There are rules
and there are regulations. Because of the way North Carolina is
structured, we refer to regulations as rules. But they are not
necessarily interchangeable. When we say rules we could be meaning
regulations, and when we're saying regulations we could be meaning
rules. I beg your indulgence on the semantic part, because it's
something that you will learn to differentiate as you do your work with
this Committee. We also have Jeff Hudson and Harrison Moore. Our
Committee Clerk will be Lisa Kennedy. We have a couple of interns that
will be helping us as well. Kyle Turbo is an intern from NC State.
Again, I'd like to welcome you to the Committee and I look forward to
working with you. Today's full Committee meeting is really to educate
the new members as well as the existing members about regulatory reform
and what that actually means. I'd like to turn the meeting over to Ms.
Cochran-Brown. We'll follow your lead. You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, members of the Committee.
My name is Karen Cochran-Brown. I'm a research attorney in the Research
Division of the General Assembly. I've worked in the area of
Administrative Law for about 20 years now. And I've staffed the Joint
Legislative Administrative Procedure Oversight Committee, which is the
legislative body that reviews administrative law issues, and has done so
since 1996. As I go through the presentation this morning, I'm going to
give a sort of 30,000 mile overview of the process of rule making in
North Carolina. In front of you, you should all have a</p>

<p id="05:00">
one of these red documents. This is a much more detailed version of the
rule making process that was originally prepared for the Joint
Legislative Administrative Oversight Procedure Committee. And I'll ask
that you all can refer to that if you have further questions about the
process after this meeting. Certainly please feel free to contact me at
any time if you have any questions about any of the things that we're
covering today or any issues with administrative law. I'll do my best to
provide the answers to whatever questions you may have. Some of you may
have heard this presentation before. There are a few members here that
either were on the Joint Regulatory Reform Committee in the last bianium
or on APO this year the Administrative Procedure Oversight Committee
this year. Our Co-Chair is a member of this committee as well,
Representative Murry. So you may have heard this before and I apologize
for being repetitive for some folks but hopefully this will be helpful
to most of you. Let us start this morning with an outline of what we're
gonna talk about. So first we're gonna, I'm gonna try and go a little
into the quagmire that the Chair alluded to about the definitions of
what we're talking about. And I'm not sure that necessarily we'll come
out of this a lot clearer than we start with but hopefully we can shed a
little light on it and explain that a little. Then we're gonna talk
about, a little bit about the different kinds of regulatory authority
which is part of why the definition is so confusing. And much of, most
of this presentation will deal with state administrative agency
regulations so we'll talk about the source of their authority for that
regulation. We'll talk a little about the purpose of the APA the
Administrative Procedure Act that governs the process. And we'll go step
by step through the process for adopting permanent rules so you can sort
of understand how this all works. Finally we'll talk about some
potential future actions that this committee or the General Assembly
might look at in further efforts towards regulatory reform. And then
we'll conclude the presentation. So I would hope that with the Chair's
indulgence if you have any questions please feel free to interrupt me.
So we'll start. To begin with what is regulation? My Co-Counsel Jeff
Hudson and I have sort of had a debate over the last week or so about
whether all rules are regulations or all regulations are rules or
basically how that would work. So basically we went to the dictionary to
try and find an all purpose general definition of the term. The verb to
regulate basically means to govern direct according to rule to bring
under the control of law or constituted authority. So and regulation the
definition of regulation is a little bit closer to what we sort of think
of an authoritative rule dealing with details or procedure having the
force of law and issued by an executive authority of government. That
may not help a whole lot but part of the difficulty is when most people
think of regulation they essentially think of things that government
does that they generally often don't like. That its either limiting
rights or creating duties or imposing burdens or doing certain things.
That regulation can come from any number of sources. It isn't always
administrative agencies. Many of the laws that you all enact are
regulation. They fit within that broad definition of what is to
regulate. State rules administrative agency rules are a different thing
and that's more likely, but that's a different kind of regulation. So
both the state and federal government can do both statutes and rules or
regulations. Both the state and they do both statutes and rules. Local
governments can enact ordinances. That's a different kind of regulation.
They also regulate. It's outside of the preview of what generally we
talk about here. But they can do that. Additionally judicial made law
can impose regulations by court order or decisions of courts essentially
they can set parameters or requirements in the law. And that's a
different form of regulation. This presentation is gonna deal primarily
with the regulations created by state agencies. And I will say to
clarity just a little bit</p>

<p id="10:00">
The term in North Carolina, the defined term, is rule. And we'll get a
little bit into that in a little while, the specific definition of the
term rule, but generally when we're talking about things that
administrative agencies adopt in North Carolina they are called rules.
In the federal system there is a code of federal regulations. So the
defined term in the federal system is regulation. They're the same sorts
of things, they are things that are adopted by administrative agencies
to implement laws but they're called by those different names. So
essentially the terms are really interchangeable. For purposes of North
Carolina, more often than not, they'll be called rules because that's
our defined term. I hope that helps just a little bit in that bit of a
quagmire. So let's talk a little bit about the sources of the Executive
Branch regulatory authority. The North Carolina Constitution vest all of
the legislative power, that is the power to make law, in the General
Assembly. The General Assembly is authorized to prescribe the functions,
powers, and duties of all administrative agencies. The Constitution
doesn't really give the Executive Branch any particular power in this
regard. The Governor is charged with ensuring that the laws are
faithfully executed and to that extent there's some debate over whether
that implies some inherent authority to interpret the law but,
basically, the courts in North Carolina have found generally that the
General Assembly has to specifically delegate the power to make rules to
an administrative agency and it has to define that power specifically
enough so that the agency knows what it's supposed to do and how it's
supposed to implement the law. So bottom line on that is that the power
of the administrative agency to create rules, or regulation in this
case, is entirely dependent on the General Assembly. The General
Assembly never has to delegate that power to an agency in any instance.
If you all wanted, any time you pass a law you could specifically go
into, you could call in the experts you needed, you could define all of
the specific details of how that was to be implemented and basically
remove the need for agencies to have to ever adopt rules by being
specific in the legislation. As you know, lawmaking can be a very
difficult process and it can often be very difficult for you all to
amass all of the technical expertise necessary to make all those
detailed interpretations and that's why the courts have interpreted the
constitution that the General Assembly has the power, essentially, to
delegate a portion of its lawmaking power, it's called quasi-legislative
power, to executive branch agencies. That's the source of their power.
One of the concerns about this is that once that power is given, once
you make that delegation to an executive branch agency, because of their
constitutional charge to make sure that the laws are faithfully
executed, it becomes to some extend within their purview and separation
of powers may be implicated if the General Assembly then attempts to
insert itself too far into the exact rule-making process of the agency.
Once you've given them the power to do it and passed the law and given
them guidance on how you expect them to implement the law it's in their
power to do so. And if you don't like how they've done it after the fact
you can come back and change certain things. You can change their
authority, you can take away the power from them and give it to someone
else, you can more clearly define, by statute, what the intent of the
legislature was in creating that program to begin with. But what's much
more questionable is whether the General Assembly can actually go into
the administrative code, which is the body of law that holds all of the
rules, and change the words in a rule by itself. You can direct the
agency to do it but it's problematic, I think, under separation of
powers for the legislature actually to go in the code and change rules
itself. So the General Assembly retains all the power in this whole
process, really, it's just that you have to exercise that, sometimes, a
little more carefully in some instances. I'd also like to add that not
all regulation is a bad thing. It's problematic in many instances, there
certainly are cases where it is a problem, but many regulations are</p>

<p id="15:00">
Necessary. There are regulations that define procedure such as the rule
that provides for the method of the procedure to be used in changing
your best beneficiary in the retirement system. It would be useful to
know how to do that. The retirement system can't make it up as they go
along. They've adopted the rule, essentially, that says what the
procedure is that you have to follow to accomplish that goal and that's
a necessary rule. Similarly, some rules authorize the provision of
benefits such as division of health services rule that authorizes local
government, local health departments, to provide children with
vaccinations within their jurisdiction. Similarly, there are rules that
limit the regulator. The APA includes a requirement that all agencies
adopt a rule for how people can petition for rule making. A citizen
essentially believes that a rule should be adopted in a particular way
but don't like the rule that the agency adopted and thinks it should be
done differently. There is a procedure for a citizen to petition that
agency to adopt a particular rule. The procedure isn't spelled out in
the APA but the APA directs each agency to adopt a rule saying what that
procedure would be. So that's a limitation on the regulator, on the
agency in that case. In the best of circumstances regulations can
clarify ambiguity, promote fairness and enhance efficiency and that's
the goal, basically, to create a process that moves in that direction
most of the time. So now let's move to the administrative procedure act
and this is the process by which rules are created in North Carolina.
The APA was enacted in North Carolina in the first one in the late 70's
and it was advised in Chapter 150B in the general statutes in the 80's.
There have been amendments to the APA almost every year that I've worked
in the General Assembly. This is always a work in progress and it's
always moving towards the goal of attempting to balance the needs of
agencies for some flexibility in interpreting the laws that they're
charged with administering and with the needs of the public to know and
have input in that process. Though the APA's stated purpose says in
section 1 of the APA that it was enacted to establish a uniform system
of administrative rule making and a judicatory procedure for state
agencies. We're not going to talk about the judicatory procedure today
but basically the idea was to create a single system by which all
agencies would operate. One of the things that happened very soon there
after however was that the legislature almost immediately began creating
exemptions and when you look in the red pamphlet there it sort of lists
all of the exemptions that over the years they've grown considerably.
One of the things that happens when the rule making process, when
agencies feel that it's ?? is that they come to the General Assembly and
seek an exemption from all or some part of the APA in order for them to
accomplish the task that the General Assembly has set to them. So that's
one of the things that  you all might want to look at is the exemptions
that have been enacted in the past whether they're still necessary or
valid. Another primary although unstated  purpose of the APA is to
ensure due process to citizens and this really is sort of the framework
the underpinning of what it really - why this process exists. When you
all enact laws, the Constitution says that you have to read them 3
times, that they have to be publicly presented. Basically it's done in
the daylight so that the public knows when you all are passing laws,
what the law is. They have an opportunity to contact you and have input
on that. Similarly, when you delegate that law-making power to an
administrative agency, there needs to be a process where by the public
can have notice of what they're doing and have an opportunity to be
heard. The APA creates that general process for rule making and for any
agency that is subject to the APA, and that really is most of them,
that's the process that they have to follow. It's important to know that
the APA does not apply to the legislature, it does not apply to the
judiciary or to local government. The APA is strictly a method of
governing the rule making procedure for state executive branch agencies.
One of the most important</p>

<p id="20:00">
Definition. The AK contains a number of definitions, but one of the most
definitions is the term rule, and you’ll see up there part of the
definition from the APA overrule and this is important because this is
how you know whether or not the agency has to go through this process or
not. If what they are doing, if whatever action or pronouncement the
agency makes fits within that definition. It needs to be adopted as a
rule. Now what’s not on the slide, but is within your red pamphlet is,
there’s a list in the APA of things that are not a rule, and many of
those are essentially things that don’t affect people outside the
agency. Well they might affect them indirectly, but don’t affect people
directly outside the agency. Statements of internal management are not
required to be adopted as rules. Budgetary documents are not necessarily
required to be adopted as rule there’s a whole list of things, specific
scientific design things that are not required to be adopted as rules
But basically any statement that they make, that’s going to affect
people outside the agency implementing or interpreting a law has to be
adopted as a rule. So let’s talk about how we adopt a rule in North
Carolina and what I’m going to go through now is basically the process
for permanent rule making. I’ll start out by saying that the APA is a
very flexible law and there are two other kinds of rule making temporary
and emergency. I won’t go through those, they are in that pamphlet. But
basically those are more expedited ways that an agency can get a rule in
to affect and in under certain circumstances the general assembly has
found it’s appropriate for agencies to have that flexibility but for the
most part, if a rule is going to stay in effect indefinitely, it has to
be adopted as a permanent rule, and this is the process for that.
So the first step in the process is that the agency determines that a
rule is needed. This step actually is something that was added in the
last biennium in the regulatory reform act, much of it comes from what
was executive order 70 at that point in time, but it basically creates
the standard that the agency should hold itself to when it’s actually
developing and drafting the rule, before they actually formally begin
the rule making process. There is in the APA a list of regulatory
principles that the agency should follow in terms of how they approach
it. That they should attempt to seek the least burdensome way for doing
them. That they should comply with to make sure the rule complies with
the latest scientific and technological standards available. That they
should not adopt rules that basically are unnecessary. If cumulatively
all the rules that they already have, say add up to whatever they think
they need to adopt as new rule then they don’t need to adopt that rule.
Those are principles that agencies are advised to follow now. They are
also required to post this information on the website as they go along,
any changes in the rule making process they have to follow.
Second step in the process, is that the agency has to prepare federal
certification. Whenever a proposed rule is necessary to implement or
comply with federal law. This is something that’s used later on in the
process to make sure that they’re not adopting rule unnecessarily. This
is being brought on by federal law as opposed to something specifically
in state law they have to include a certification. That also has to be
posted on the website.
The third step is probably one of the most important steps in the
process, and that is the preparation of fiscal notes. Under North
Carolina law, there are four kinds of fiscal analysis that agencies
might be required to go through. They have to determine whether or not
state funds are implicated in the rule. If it’s an environmental project
that would affect a transportation issue, the board of transportation
basically if they find that the problematic, can send a letter to the
rules review commission, and basically that rule can’t go into effect
until the rule comes back to the legislature, and I’ll discuss that a
little more later on. Agencies have also to determine when or whether
the rule will have a local government fiscal impact or not.</p>

<p id="25:00">
And finally, the agencies have to determine whether or not the rule will
have a substantial economic impact. Now, that’s a defined term in the
APA; it basically means that it will have an impact on all persons
affected, an aggregate impact of all persons affected of $500,000 or
more in a 12 month period. If that is so they basically have to include
some information about how that was determined and who that would affect
but there is a specific format for substantial economic impact fiscal
notes and they can be done either by the agency or the Office of State
Budget and Management  and they’re reviewed by the Office of State
Budget and Management  has to sign off on them. The accuracy of this or
the existence of this doesn’t affect the agency’s ability to adopt the
rule or implement it; it basically is just something that they have to
go through as an information, and it should guide their; it’s basically
intended to guide their rulemaking process. If there’s a way to make
the, yes, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. If an agency does the economic impact what’s the level
of qualifications that that person has to have to do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The statute doesn’t indicate it as I said they have to be signed off by
the Office of State Budget and Management and the people that do it
there are economists.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But the local agency doesn’t have to use an economist?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They probably should or OSBM may or may not. Often if the agency doesn’t
feel that it has the expertise it will defer to the Office of State
Budget and Management and allow them to do it, which is an alternative
under the APA.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And how many economists do we have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can’t answer that. OK. The next step, the publication of the notice of
text, this is the beginning of the formal rule making process. This is
the point at which it moves outside of the agency and goes to the Office
of Administrative Hearings which basically is charged with codification
and review of rules. So, at this point the agency submits a notice of
text which includes the language of the proposed rule. It includes the
date on which they will hold a public hearing if they’re having one. It
includes the name of the person that the public can contact if they have
questions about the rule. It includes a statement about how someone who
objects to the rule can seek legislative review of the rule. There are a
number of things in the statute that are required to be within in the
notice of text and this is the point when that’s done. They send the
notice of text to the Office of Administrative Hearings and the codifier
of rules publishes that in the North Carolina register. Next step is the
public hearing and comment period. From the time of the publication of
the notice of text, the agency cannot move forward for at least 60 days;
they have to accept public comment on both the proposed rule and the
fiscal note for the rule because it’s been published with the notice of
text for at least 60 days. Although, the statute doesn’t specifically
require that all agencies have to have a public hearing, it does say
that if someone requests a public hearing then they have to have it. So,
agencies routinely just schedule a public hearing so that it won’t be
delayed in the process by not having done so. So finally after the
public comment period has elapsed the agency can formally adopt the
rule. Up until this point it’s been a proposed rule; it’s been
potentially subject to change. Hopefully, the agency has taken to heart
any public comment that it’s received, any concerns by people that would
be regulated by the rule, and if necessary make changes to the rule to
comply with that. The agency can’t adopt the rule until at least the
public comment period has elapsed and they also can’t adopt it if more
than 12 months elapsed since the end of the public comment period. So,
if they just leave the rule laying out there for a year past the comment
period they have to start all over again, they can’t just pick that rule
back up after that. They also can’t adopt a rule that differs
substantially from what was in the proposed text to the published rule
and substantially differing actually is defined in the APA and it
basically means that if it’s going to affect people that didn’t think
they were going to be affected under the proposed</p>

<p id="30:00">
Or if it's going to effect people in a different way than they expected.
If the rule is changed enough so that it's going to have a different
impact than the people anticipated from the proposed language then they
have to go back and republish them. ?? It essentially has to start the
process over again, give those people an opportunity to respond to it.
So the next stage. Now it's out of the agency's hand, essentially, once
the agency adopts it they've done what they can do to the rules. It the
goes to a body called the rules review commission. The rules review
commission is housed in the office of administrative hearings. It is a
10 member body that's appointed by, 5 members by the speaker and 5
members by the president pro tempore. They are public members who serve
on this. The rules review commission meets monthly and they review any
rules that have been submitted to them by the 20th of the month
preceding their meeting and they review the rules for very specific
things. The statute provides a set of 4 standards that the rules review
commission applies. First of all they have to determine whether or not
the agency had statutory authority to adopt the rule. This is the most
important probably function that the rules commission provides.  This is
sort of the quality assurance check and it's the check on agencies
exceeding their authority. Basically the agency has to demonstrate to
the rules review commission that the General Assembly gave them the
power to do this rule, and if they don't do that then the rules review
commission can and will object the rule. They also review the rules for
clearness and unambiguousness, basically they want people to understand
what it is that the rule says. They determine whether the rule was
reasonably necessary, whether or not the cumulative effect of all the
rules that they have out there would have said the same thing or whether
the statute says the same thing. If it's unnecessary they can object to
the rule on that basis and they also determine whether or not the rule's
been adopted in accordance with the process in the APA. That they've
gone through all the steps that the law requires them to have gone
through. If the rules review commission approves the rule then we go on
to the effective date. Rules generally become effective on the first day
of the month following the month that the rules review commission
approves the rule. That's the general rule so if the agencies adopted,
it's gotten approved by the rules review commission it can go into
effect the first of that next month unless, and this is the big unless,
if the rules review commission receives 10 letter from anyone in the
world objecting to that rule and seeking legislative review then the
rule does not go into effect. The rule then essentially goes into a
different basket and that basket is all the rules that are held until
the next legislative session and the process here is intended to catch
controversial rules. This is the method by which if there really is a
rule that the agency has adopted even though they have the authority to
adopt it if there is some feeling that this was not what the legislature
intended or it was going to create consequences that might not have been
foreseen by the legislature then the appropriate place to deal with that
problem is the legislature, so if there are 10 letters these rules wait
until the legislature comes back into session. When the legislature
comes back into session any member, any of you, any member of the
General Assembly can introduce a bill to disapprove that bill and if a
bill is introduced to disapprove that rule, that rule can't go into
effect until some action is taken on that bill. Now if nobody introduces
a bill to disapprove the rule, if no legislature introduces a bill, then
that rule can go into effect on the 31st legislative day, so we
routinely count, the agencies count. If there are 10 letters, they count
and wait until the 31st legislative day. If there's no bill, the rule
goes into effect. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
just a question, if the legislature is not in session at the wait and
what happens if the bill is just filed and is not heard. Well, just
filing continues the delay process, so if it's filed and nothing happens
and the legislature adjourns the rule goes into effect the day after
adjournment, but it basically has to stay there once a bill is filed.
OK, so that's the legislative review process. That essentially really is
the permanent rule making process.</p>

<p id="35:00">
Once it's gone through all of these hoops it'll either go into effect on
the day after it's approved by the rules review commission or if it gets
10 letters it gets held up until the next session. It can then either go
into effect on the 31st legislative day if it doesn't get a bill. If a
bill is introduced it goes into effect either when some action is taken
on the bill or the session adjourns without any action being taken on
the bill. As I said there are 2 other kinds of rule making, temporary
rule making and emergency rule making. I'm not going to go through
those, they are abbreviated versions of this process and I will say both
temporary and emergency rules are very limited. They can only stay in
effect for a certain period of time without the agency going forward
with permanent rule making. They can stay in effect for a little longer
if the agency has proceeded to a certain point with permanent rule
making, but essentially they are not intended as an alternative to
permanent rule making. Permanent rule making is the basic way that you
adopt rules in North Carolina. There are some other requirements that
agencies have relating to rules that are in the APA that are a little
unique that I thought I'd talk about. One of the other things that was
done in the last biannuum was to create the rule modification
improvement program which is a process for the annual review of existing
rules. Under this process agencies are directed each year to review
their existing rules and to determine whether they continue to be
necessary or whether they comply with the rule making principles that
were adopted also and to repeal any rules that fail that test, so
agencies are supposed to do a sort of self monitoring assisted by the
office of state budget and management. In addition the office of state
budget and management has a public website that collects comments from
the public on rules, on regulation essentially. They receive a number of
comments from the public about regulatory concerns. They have a process
whereby they send those comments to the affected agency and ask the
agency basically to tell them what's been done about it. OSBM makes an
analysis of that and complies all that information into a report, so
annually for the last 2 years, OSBM has done a report on what these
agencies have done in response to their, to the concerns that have been
raised by the public and their review of their existing rules. The other
thing that was done in the last biannuum was to include a limitation on
certain environmental rules and this basically was a provision that said
certain agencies are prohibited from adopting environmental rules that
are more restrictive than an analogous federal rule unless the rule is
necessary to respond to an emergency, a specific change in the law or
budget policy or a court order, and the specific agencies that are
subject to this limitation are set forth in your brochure. It's not all
agencies, it's a specified set of agencies that often adopt rules
related to environmental issues. Some of the things that this committee
might choose to look at in the future with regard to possible further
improvements in the regulatory process, one of them is a bill that was
recommended by the joint legislative administrative procedure oversight
committee from this last biannuum. The received, ATO received a
recommendation from the rules review commission that basically would
institute a sort of sunset process that would provide for a review of
existing rules spread out over a period of time and basically make those
agencies go through the rule making process again and if they don't go
through the process again those rules would expire automatically. This
is something that you all maybe considered. The bill was filed and
sponsored by Representative Murry who is co-chair of APO. Another idea
that's been raised a couple of times that might improve the process is
to simplify the process for the repeal of rules. Currently a repeal is
treated the same as an adoption or an amendment of a rule. It has to go
through the same process as if it were a new rule and some folks have
suggested that it might be a good idea to make it easier to repeal
rules, so that's something that this committee might want to look at.
Another option is possibly strengthening the existing rules review
process, that process</p>

<p id="40:00">
LSBM does now annually, of seeking updates from the agencies;
it's sort of a self-monitoring process neither LSBM nor anyone else
has any sort of clout to enforce that, so this committee may want
to look at ways to enforce agencies actually going through that
process and carrying it through. Finally, the most important thing...
I understand this is a long and boring presentation and I understand
more than
anybody how boring rule-making can be, I enjoy it, but I understand that
most people don't. The most important thing I would hope you all would
be
able to take away from this is the legislature has ultimate authority
over
agency regulation. They can't adopt any rules that you all don't give
them the authority to adopt, so keeping that in mind in all the bills
that
you enact. Every time you enact a bill, consider whether or not this is
going to require that an agency adopt some rules as a a result of it,
and perhaps giving them more close guidelines in what you expect from
them when they do adopt rules. It's also really important to distinguish
between the concerns with process and the concerns with the underlying
policy. The process, as I said, is designed to create uniformity and
ensure due process. The process probably does a pretty good job at those
goals, even though the process is alright however that doesn't
necessarily mean you're going to like the outcome. I can give you an
example of a situation I've seen fairly recently. The Board of Cosmetics
Arts Examiners has the authority to set sanitation requirements for hair
salons. Over the years a number of people have had the idea that it
would be a great idea to
have mobile hair salons that could go around to disabled people and
invalid people and provide those services to them on a mobile basis. The
Board of Cosmetic Arts Examiners has adopted a rule that says you can't
do that. And that rule is based on their interpretation of the
sanitation requirement. They have determined that maintaining the
required sanitation standards in a mobile context would be too difficult
for them to be able to monitor and that it would potentially create a
danger to the public. That is a perfectly appropriate
rule under the authority that the General Assembly gave that board...to
adopt that rule. You may not agree with it, and that might not be the
policy the General Assembly wants to enact. So certainly the General
Assembly could come in and clarify to basically authorize mobile hair
salons, it could give the Board of Cosmetic Arts Examiners further
guidelines in terms of how
strictly you want them to construe that authorization. That illustrates
the difference...the process wasn't the problem in that place, it was
the underlying policy. And that's always within the purview of the
General Assembly. So I'd hope you'll keep that in mind, the process
can't necessarily solve those problems all the time if it's a policy
issue that reasonable people could differ on, you all have the authority
to make that decision but when you delegated
it broadly to the agency there is the possibility they'll interpret it
in a way that you don't necessarily agree with. Also, sometimes, people
think it's the agency that's done it and it turns out it wasn't the
agency that did it, it was in the law all along. An example of that is
last year there was a concern about food trucks and whether or not food
trucks could basically be self contained. There was a perception that
there was a rule that food trucks had to have a home base that was a
restaurant or a commissary. Well it turned out that wasn't in the rule,
it was in the law in the statute, that was something you all
specifically set a limitation on...on mobile food units being able to do
that. So it's really important to always know the difference between
whether it's a policy issue or a process issue. Over the past few years,
the process for new rules has really been strengthened a lot. It may be,
as we discussed, that there is some room for improvement over the review
process for existing rules. But I hope that you all will now have a
better understanding of how this whole process works and what
we're talking about when we talk about regulatory reform. And with that,
Mr. Chair I'd be glad to accept any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Cochran-Brown, on be half of the chair...</p>

<p id="45:00">
Excellent job on a less than riveting topic. If the members would wake
up and if you have any questions please direct those to the Chair. I
believe Representative Brody had a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chairman. Actually I'm real interested in this subject so I stayed
awake the whole way through. I'm glad your first and your very last
slide had an important part that the old legislature is the ultimate
authority on this and as I listened through all the process I've just
come to the conclusion, and first being relatively new maybe mistakenly
come to the conclusion, but that ?? only have a veto power over the
proposed legislation because when it comes right down to the end comes
out of the regulatory review commission and somebody objects we actually
have to go through a bill process, a complete bill process in order to
change it. And it seems like, and once again my own opinion, that maybe
streamlining that whole process to say you have rules, bring them to the
legislature and let the legislature submit them to committee and the
committee then in turn decides one way or the other. It's interesting
you brought up the hair salon and how much danger or how much
controversy would come from something that an agency just determines and
creates this controversy then we have to go back to the legislature and
adjust it. Maybe in this process of initially submitting it to the
legislature maybe we could work through a lot of those things and never
really come to that because we probably have a lot of ideas on those
things and I thank you for your presentation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Was
there question for Representative Brody? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well my first
speaking in the committee here and - [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've done an
excellent job. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question being, I guess is there any
process by which we can actually streamline the process itself because
what I was just explaining is more of a process situation than a policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Brody. I'm not sure that what
I think you were proposing actually would streamline it, I think it
actually would lengthen the process. If we required all rules to come to
the legislature before they actually adopted. You all are not in session
at all times and agencies have to keep administering the law during all
of that time so that would delay a lot of their processing so it isn't
necessarily streamlining. It might be streamlining for those
controversial those rules where there is a difference in terms of what
approach the agencies should take about it. That really - in 2003 the
process for the 10 letters basically was an act of that and that was the
goal in 2003 to basically try and find a fairly simple way to identify
the problematic rules that people had concerns with and there was some
difference in terms of what policy intent actually was so that was the
process that was developed to do that. I will tell you that there are a
fairly small number of rules - small categories of rules that are
subject to that. Right now for this session there are a group of rules
that were adopted by the industrial commission that are subject to
legislative review and there are a group of rules that were adopted by
the wildlife resource commission that are subject to legislative rule.
Out of the thousands of rules that were adopted and proved by the rules
review commission over since the last session, those are the only
categories of rules that got the 10 letters. So it sort of seems for new
rules at least that process does provide a way to get the one rules that
you want to hear about over here. I know that helps. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. My
question goes back to the original publishing of the rule. The register
and all these wonderful little things that are hidden around and you've
got to know exactly where they are to get to them. The general public
isn't that knowledgeable</p>

And are quite aware of all the little hidey holes. Is there any, has
there been any study of how to make this a little bit more public in
terms of when these rules are out there because I know they are interest
groups and there are people who have a direct impact and they study
these the way lawyers read the ads in the paper that nobody else reads
and I was wondering is there some way or has there been discussion of
making it a more public process so that the general public who may at
some point down the road be impacted by the rule know what's going on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One of the things that you did in the last biannuum
was require that the agency continued to publish on its website and
pretty much every agency has a website now, any rule making that they're
doing. The register is online. I'll also say that the APA contains a
provision that requires each agency to maintain an interested persons'
mailing list so that if you think that you might be interested in a rule
that a particular agency might ever adopt, you can get your name on that
list so that then that agency is required to notify you when they
commence rule making, so the APA does contain a provision to try and
give people an opportunity to be notified when rules are being adopted,
but beyond that I'm not sure that there really has been. That has been a
concern, it has been discussed in the past, there's just not a clear way
to do it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hardister. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the presentation. I was wondering
if you could reiterate how the rules review commission is configured.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The rules review commission is a 10 member body. 5 of
its members are appointed by the speaker and 5 of its members are
appointed by the president pro tempore. They are all public members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I assume the
rules review commission was created by the general assembly for a
purpose and the purpose seems to be perhaps a poor size agency where you
filter these rules for a reason and the general assembly assigned the
task but is prevented from considering the quality or the efficacy of
the rule. My question is, and I know it's been restricted to the
reviewing the statutory standards, is that fulfilling the actual intent
of the general assembly as to why the rules review commission was
created? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think it was, that language was added
by the general assembly as well, I think in 2003, about limiting what
they can do. The idea is that the rules review commission even though
they are appointed by the legislative leaders is still performing an
executive branch function and I think that the idea was that the rules
review commission was not created to substitute their judgment for that
of the agencies but basically to review that agencies had actually
complied with what the law required, so that certainly is something that
the general assembly can revisit but I think that was part of the basis
for including that language in there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Bumgardner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did I hear you say that the legislative
review committee was created 2 years ago? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, this
is sort of a complicated, convoluted history, but I'll try to explain
it. I'm not sure what I said specifically, but the legislative
administrative procedure oversight committee was originally created in
1995. In 2011 it was briefly repealed and there was a joint legislative
reform committee for the 2011 biannuum and that committee performed a
similar function to what the oversight committee had done. Last summer
the APO was reestablished and functioned during this interim as well,
but for a brief period the APO went out and reg reform came in and now
APO is back. Does that help? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, I have a follow up. What did we do before that? You said
we started this in the '70's and then we had a review committee in '95,
what happened before that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there wasn't a formal
legislative oversight committee. Clearly the general assembly continued
to oversee the process. The APA was amended a number of times during
that interim. I will say there was briefly in the '80's</p>

<p id="55:00">
Was a legislative version of the rules review commission, but in 1982, I
believe, the Supreme Court decided the bone decision, which basically is
our seminal case on powers. If there was a concern, this was actually
legislators reviewing rules, was a potential violation of separation of
powers clause. So, that's when that was changed and the rules review
commission, as it now exists was created in the late 80s. There's been a
lot changes over the years in this. I'll be glad to go through the
history, as you like, but it isn't necessarily a very clear linear
process in this. There have been lots of attempts.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Works just like the ones they have at the school board, thanks. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman and Thank you, Miss Brown for your comments. Its a
great presentation, I'd like to get a copy of that, but I wanted to
follow up on what Representative Brody was talking about because he
spoke directly to something I was concerned about. I think a lot of
people in here are. In fact, I think it was before Floydd and it was a
lot of conversation about, what eventually became Fog out of ??. I think
it was HB1066, I don't remember in 03' or 04'. I don't remember the time
frame, I was on the county board at that time. I was involved in putting
that together and in the end we lost a couple of business in Lake Forest
because of it. I'm glad to see that we have a rules review committee,
and I'm glad that its processes are doing what intended to do, but I
really think this is something that should be looked at again. I would
love to see some of these rules not go to a sub-committee, I don't know.
But, I think that's something to look at because we want to make sure
that although it was a great idea and I supported it that we look for
flexibilities, and it is what we want it to do. We don't want people to
assume that we're creating rules and regulations by people that aren't
elected and that the people who are elected are the ones who are saying
yes, that we're for that. So, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I just wanted to comment and then a
question. My experience is there's always someone who doesn't like a
rule and so the rule review committee submitter sort of stop ?? measure
for reviewing one more time. But, the question I have is and I apologize
for coming in late, some of us were in another committee, did you
discuss the time frame and the ability of a legislator to file a bill
and stop a rule before it goes into effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, thank you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Riddell?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Moving back to the rules on the review
commission. You've spoken in regards of who appoints them, are there any
type of expertise or qualifications that are specified in order to be a
member of the rules review commission?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Does the rules and review commission, does the
general public have an address for them?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
And, that is what?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
They are here now. They are located out on New Hope Church Road, but
they are actually housed in the Office of Administrative Hearings. There
are folks here that are from the office, that are both from rules of
commission and the . . . I can get you their address specifically.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Is is on the website?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Mam, it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Are there any additional questions for members of the committee?
Representative Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'll just kind of wrap this up. The APO committee, there was a couple of
things that came up during the administrative procedure oversight
committee during the interium and that was, one there are rules that
exist that might not be tied to a statute. There's an issue there that
bears addressing. There are policies that exist under administrative
agencies that haven't gone through the rule making process. Those are
two major issues where regulation is occuring, but the process hasn't
had a chance to go through. The two issues haven't havd a chance to go
through the process. I think those are a couple of things we're
concerned about are rules that are not based on statute and rules,
policies that haven't gone through the rule making process. So, those
are another couple layers.</p>

The amount of work that the roles for review commission does with the
level of staffing and funding they receive is dramatically incredible
and if we want them to do the kind of work that we think that  should be
able to do , we are going to be need to incorporate that in to our
budget process. Especially if we are going to ask them to look at every
role and determine whether they need to stay, go or sunset and that’s a
big job and we need to appropriate the appropriate funding for them to
be able to that as well
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Rep Murray. The chair agrees. Any additional
questions from the members of the committee. Rep Stevens
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you. And I know we probably are going to have a
big task particularly in vide of what Rep Murray had said. We discovered
in the APA oversight committee that the department of public
construction has never submitted a role for review. Never. And their web
site is full of roles what they say are roles that are promulgated which
they have done by policies but not a single one has been to the roles
commission in twelve years. I am hoping we are going to take a good
strong look at that. Is that in your plan, Rep Moffet.
[Speaker Changes]  It would be
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you Rep Stevens. Rep Holley
[Speaker Changes]  Yes. we were just discussing whether or not the
agencies that have executive people to head them, are they included in
the oversight process like the labor, agriculture, DPI, are they
included or we only talking about the state agencies like
administration, health and human services deaner
[Speaker Changes]  Rep Holley. All executive branch agencies that
includes the council of state agencies and the governor’s office, they
are all subjected to administrative procedures act.
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you. Any additional questions from the members
of the committee.
[Speaker Changes]  Mr Chair. Thank you Mr Chair. I just wondered I
actually get an email from the RRC before they meet so that I can look
at the rules they are looking at their agenda. Would it be appropriate
for the members of this committee to be able to get the same thing. it’s
very interesting. you see something that you are really interested in.
you could actually see the rules. I think that might be helpful to all
the committee members here.
[Speaker Changes] That’s a good suggestion. Thank you. Any additional
questions. All right for freshmen of this committee, there would be a
part quiz on this 10 minutes before next week’s meeting. Before we
adjourn and we do have a little housekeeping to take care of. Today on
the floor we would be debating house adopting the permanent house rules
and within those rules it does provide room for this committee to
constitute a sub committee. Those three sub committees would be business
and labor chaired by Rep Murray, environment chaired by Rep Catlin and
local government chaired by Rep William Brawley. If Rep Murray could go
ahead and announce your vice chairs and members of the committee. These
would be officially part of the record once they are read in on the
floor and the sub committees once the permanent rules are adopted will
be official. But I thought in anticipation of next week’s meeting, we go
ahead and get that out of the way. Rep Murray.
