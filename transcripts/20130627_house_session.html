The prayer will be offered by Rep. John Szoka. Members and visitors in
the gallery please stand and remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As we've all been taught, prayer doesn't change God.
It changes the ones who pray. Please join me in prayer. O, God, creator
and preserver of all, we pray for people of every nation and every kind
of need. Make your ways known on earth, your saving power among all
nations. We pray to you for our government at the national state and
local levels. Give wisdom to those you have placed in authority. Guide
these leaders in the administration of justice and the application of
mercy. We commend to your fatherly goodness to all who are anxious and
distressed in mind, body or spirit. Comfort and relieve them in their
need. Give them patience in their sufferings, and bring good out of
their troubles. Have compassion on our weakness, and give us those
things which for our unworthiness we dare not, for our blindness we
cannot ask. All of which we ask in your most holy and precious name.
Amen.

To withdraw the conference report Mr. Speaker, and I would like to be
recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman's recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Having voted on the prevailing side I move to
reconsider the motion to not concur on the Senate committee substitute
for house bill 543. Mr. Speaker if I may be recognized to debate the
motion.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman's recognized to debate the motion. Members I know this is
a bit unusual, but I think this can be a win, win, win situation for us.
I'd like for us to score a point for bipartisanship if you will. I'd
like for us to score a point for the House of Representatives. But most
importantly I'm trying to pass a bill out that is extremely important to
a few of the citizens of our state. Last week I asked you to not concur
on this Senate committee substitute for the simple reason that a
technical change needed to be made. The Senate had added a phrase to the
bill that was unnecessary and quite honestly was to seem not to affect
anybody. We were gonna take that out and bring it back to you and have
it fixed in a conference report. However the Senate has decided at this
point not to hear any of the house bills on the floor or on the
calendar. And as I said this is a bill that may not be that important to
most people but is extremely important to a few people in our state. And
so what we're going to do with your help is that we're going to
reconsider the motion not to concur. I'm gonna ask you to vote no on
that option. And then we're gonna vote to concur, and we'll take care of
the technical change, and the technical bill. And Mr. Speaker if
Representative Glazier could be recognized, I think he would like to
speak to this as well.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
To speak to the motion Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman's recognized to debate the motion.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I concur in what Representative Jones
is suggesting. I was the one on our side of the aisle on the conference
report, it really was a technical change we were trying to accomplish.
And at this point it's more important to get the bill passed and then
deal with technical issue, and a technical corrections bill. I would
move that we support the motion to reconsider, and then again support
what will follow, which is a motion to concur, thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Moffitt, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Inquiry of the chair.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I believe Representative Jones perhaps misspoke
when he suggested we vote no on his first motion to not concur. And then
vote yes on the motion to concur.
[Speaker Change]
Well actually just by way of clarification that the gentleman's remarks
were out of order. The first matter of business before us is to, to
reconsider the prior vote.
[Speaker Change]
Understood.
[Speaker Change]
And then, and the chair based on the comments here would encourage
members to vote for it. Whether or not I should be saying that I don't
know, but that's what I meant. And then after we get it reconsidered
there will be another motion to deal with the concurrence vote. It's
kind of a reset. Further discussion, further debate? If not the question
before the house is the motion by Representative Jones to reconsider the
vote on the Senate committee substitute for house bill 543. All in favor
vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. And for motion and to
debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For motion. If I understand
correctly Mr. Speaker, what I would like to do at this point, the motion
that we are considering is the motion two not to concur, which we voted
last week. So before we can bring up the motion to concur, I'm believe
we need to vote no on that motion to not concur. Can I move to concur?

that we concur with the Senate committee ?? for House Bill 543.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. We had a fruitful discussion yesterday
and a good vote for bill and I just want to reiterate that interlinking
the Department of Commerce with the private sector for job creation and
economic development will benefit our state and help us create jobs and
be competitive with our neighbors.
Right now the Secretary of Commerce is with the North Carolina economic
developers association and there's a healthy positive buzz about this
concept in that group. They're having a panel discussion about this
issue with former secretaries of commerce from other states that
surround us in Virginia and South Carolina, which have followed,
Virginia's followed this pattern and they've seen positive results from
this effort and I'd ask members to continue their support and I'd be
glad to answer any questions.

Farmer-Butterfield and I have collaborated on an amendment that she's
offered so if we could hear that first then we would have the thing
before us.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of my
amendments yesterday. I had two and the second one was never heard and
the Representative Sam and I collaborated and here's the amendment. Page
1 line 30 and on page 2 line 6 and 7, as well as the amendment one. What
it does is basically remove or delete, the cause of, and substitute,
risk for, throughout the bill where appropriate and I ask for your
support. As I said yesterday, there's a difference between risk and
cause and I gave an example, so I just ask for your vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Sam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Functionally they're the same thing, but risk is not incorrect, and I
will – if you pass this, I will inform the Surgeon General of the United
States that he needs to change the warnings on his labels on cigarettes
as well. But I do appreciate that Representative Jean Farmer-Butterfield
working with me on this.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I did had an intern doing little research, what
other states are doing on this topic and I would urge you to support
this amendment, because our neighbors in Virginia teach risk instead of
causes. I urge your support.

Representative Fulghum, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate Representative Farmer-Butterfield's offering this amendment
that we did disagree in committee on the use of risk and cause, frankly,
because I thought they were interchangeable and I still do. I think it's
a distinction without a difference and I appreciate her willingness to
offer this amendment and I support it.

before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forward by
Representative Farmer-Butterfield for the Senate Committee Substitute of

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I really appreciate the amendment that was just
done, which improves the bill, but still wish to speak to a couple of
points and why I'm still opposed to the bill. You know, it is – one
thing to engage in the medical discussion we've engaged in, in the House
and this at least takes us part of the way to what some of the medical
evidence might suggest. But I want to remind us what we're doing. We are
not talking about this information being given to adults or put in even
high school…</p>

Or university curriculum,in any of those programs.We are talking about
changing the curriculum and the standard courses study for sexuality
courses for seventh graded,who are 12 and 13 years old.So i spent last
night and talked with ?? teachers.To all of the sexuality
education,educators in the state ??university,and they are now infact in
institute with those educators in ??The standard courses study is all
about prevention and also talks a lot on topics,it has never ever
addressed the issue of abortion.The courses study doesn't do that for a
lot of reasons.First,show a few states changing the very few states of
the country addressive,because it is fought with clinical issues and
analogical issues and very significan as we know on this world family
and spiritual and religious issues. Forget the medical issued that we
pull out there.  None of the evidence space programme that any sexuality
education, educator have on the national scale teach a portion as a
factor of risk or cause to pretime abortion, pretine birth and they do
that impart to protect the teachers. Sec ondly to protect the children
in this world. No.1 if you are a teacher think about what we are asking
them to do.  This is ?? built for us.  As this topic is understandable
everytime we talk about it in any way.  And, now we are asking teachers
who have gone with ?? reputation walked up  ??? what they can say and
cannot say for fear or alienating one set of plan and another and one
set of views on this two and other and puting none of the decisions

cause ??? what they look like and we are  ?? with all those respect to
my college we spent a couple of years ago on two hours to train
sexuality education.  And it was repeatedly said to keep mom that they
did not want any comprehensive option but we suddenly didn't want to
showing and teaching or even having children understand about condoms.
And so we don't want to say condoms to protecting pregnance ?? but we
are sure on abortion looks like and all the ways you get it. That makes
no sense to be at all as a parent or as a legislature.  This is ??? and
we try to do on these course of studies everywhere, three factors. One
is the coursable teaching something about which ?? consensus in the
medicine, No. Is the age appropriate for twelve and thirteen  years old
? Not in my opinion at all.  And No.3 is it for potential to create few
risk on teachers what they teach it and how they teach it.  Because of
?? both ways and absolutely true.  We will open up again doors ?? that
we will never be able to close ?? and we are not to scare teachers ??
and the result will be one of the three things. I feel, 1. number of
teachers will simply avoid this curriculam and they would disregard the
law and frankly I would blame them and they would do that they would be
able to say 100 other things on the curriculam which didn't have time to
get there. 2nd option they would try to comply with the law but
inevitable when John or Jane or Becky come home and they tell Mom about
abortion at school they will be ?? to pay at that school the next day.

They will actually try to teach it, they will try to get the best
information they can, and then the twelve year who barely can figure
out, and who we don't want to learn about condoms and pregnancy
prevention methods, we are not just asking them to learn in this bill
about abortions. We're asking them to connect the dots, that if they
have abortions, they will lead to pre-term births or miscarriages.
Seriously. This is a bill being passed by adults for ideological
purposes, without any understanding on its effect in the classroom, or
consequences, or ability of a twelve year old to connect the dots. To
tell them that they- a twelve year old- is supposed to make the
connection that if they have an abortion, and by the way, the difference
between medical and surgical, and how many you have, and what that is,
that they may then later on in life have a miscarriage. Does anyone here
have twelve or thirteen year old children, who they honestly think would
make that connection? And understand it? I'm not opposed, I've read the
medicine, I've read the medicine, I've read it and I do believe there is
some evidence that this is true, as to surgical, multiple surgical
interventions. I do not believe it is true to medical interventions. But
even if I understood that,I don't want this kind of topic being taught
to a twelve year old, who can't get it, and all it will do is open up
inevitably incredibly difficult questions that we are asking the teacher
to answer. That is unfair. It is unfair to the public schools, it is
unfair to the teacher, it is unfair to the child, it is unfair to the
families. And we should defeat this bill on that basis. If you want to
create this option, atleast we ought to be doing it at the highschool
level and above, and we ought to be doing it with the expertise of
everyone involved at a stakeholder table, and a decision with educators
from across the country, and medical personnel, to figure out how to do
this.
We don't even have a curriculum! And by golly, I can't imagine we're
gonna get one in the next few months. We can't even agree on the science
on the floor. This is just unfair to what we're doing to children in the
public schools. And if we're talking about, and please don't argue back
to me, we want them to have all the information. You want them to have
all the information, we should be talking to them about condoms as well.
Thank you.

question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stan do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stan, you've just heard the argument, could you,
enlighten us, on where all of the other provisions within this
particular section that are to be taught on sexual health in the seventh
grade came from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I will, and it is so ironic, in drafting, we only include there
section, subsection 4, but 4a was the Health to Youth act, primarily
sponsored by Rep. Glazier about three years ago, and under his
legislation, the same seventh graders learn about STD's, how they are
and are not transmitted, effectiveness of various contraceptives, rates
of infection among pre-teens, should I go on and on? In other words,
they- Representative Glazier insisted, and a majority of this house
barely passed, a bill insisting that beginning in seventh grade, because
we got to get them early, because they might get pregnant if they don't
know this, all of the details of human reproduction, and all the
permutations and combinations of diseases and all that kinda thing. But
lo and behold we can't talk about what happens if you get pregnant, and
then what happens if you want to have a subsequent pregnancy. We know
that 75% of people who go to an abortion clinic want to have a future
family, a future pregnancy. To deny this information, when Rep.
Glazier's given them the whole, what's her name, Dr. Ruth handbook, is
so ironic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Rep. Glazier wish to be recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see with respect if Rep. Stan would yield for one, or no more than
two questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stan, do you yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stan, you would agree would you not, until we get to I, what you've
added, that the rest of that act was based totally on the issue of
prevention. On stopping children from getting pregnant, the focus was
preventing pregnancy, is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say that's...

Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Thank you representative. And would you agree

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I agree with that, and it's irrelevant to the bill before us for the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the Lady from Buncombe, Representative Fisher,
wish to be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, I rise in
opposition to this bill today and I will tell you why.  I know your not
surprised but I wanted to take a break for just a second from men
debating the facts of women's sexuality and talk to you about how this
directly effects young  women and girls and to talk also about what's
missing in this legislation.  We are getting ready to change the
healthful living curriculum in North Carolina and what's missing, in my
mind, is the fact that this bill never went to an education committee.
This is curriculum change that we're making.  Was this bill ever
referred to an education committee? I don't think so.  Was there an
opportunity for public comment?  And during the debate on the Healthy
Youth Act, as Representative Stam will recall, I'm sure, we were bound
to call on the public to comment on every step along the way during the
debate on the Healthy Youth Act.  No public comment. No referral to
education .  And there is that inconsistency that we've heard, at least
our male colleagues talk about that we don't want to teach about
contraception but we sure as heck want to teach about abortion.  And
another question might be, why would you remove from the budget the
Child Fatality Taskforce when this is one of the primary committees that
have to do with protecting children, unborn children for that matter,
from the health risks during pregnancy.  We're getting ready to take
away one of those primary committees.  And then what about the fact that
in the senate budget, at least,  and what leaves the budget up for
contention, is the idea that the budget would take thousands of pregnant
women of the Medicaid  roles.  And what does that say about our
willingness  to make sure that children are not born preterm?  And then
a bigger question might be, Is the Healthy Youth Act working?  Is the
Healthful Living curriculum as it is right now working?  And I have to
tell you that teen pregnancy is at the lowest level in history.  And
because of that, teen abortions have dropped 78% since they peeked in
1988.  Put more simply, when you prevent a pregnancy, when you prevent a
pregnancy, abortion is never a factor.  So with all of this,  I ask you
to vote no, because we may not have invited public opinion or public
comment during the debate on this legislation but I guarantee you that
once we start teaching about abortion in the classrooms, you are going
to get parent comment. Please vote  no.

For all purposes, this gentleman from Cumberland Representative Lucas
wish to be recognized.
To offer an amendment.
You may send forth the amendment the Clerk will read.
Representative Lucas moves to amend the bill on page one, lines two
through five by rewriting the lines to read.
You may debate the amendment. Thank you, Mister Speaker.
My amendment opposes a conservative approach to this issue.
Conservative, now I believe many of us believe in conservatism. Right
now, we’re taking a giant liberal leap with this bill and liberalism
sometimes is not what we want. This conservative amendment would one
prevent us from taking that giant leap to conceive that the real purpose
of health, youth activity that is abstinence did not work. Whenever we
do this bill, we’re saying that abstinence doesn’t work and I think may
sometimes I concur. The second part of this amendment would, uh, state
that we believe that we don’t need to move and teach kids about sexual
activity. The third is that we’re conceding that contraception doesn’t
work. We didn’t believe in that anyway, but we’ll skipping all these
parts what we go over to what we’re doing now. The fourth part is that
there will be some kind of dissension about a pregnancy that either
they’ll be a birth or they’ll be a termination and when we get all down
to the meat of what this bill does and it talks about subsequent
pregnancies. Notice how we’ve skipped with all this liberal leap, down
to subsequent pregnancies where we’re talking about what it may do to
again, what it may do to pre-term births, not what it will, but what it
may do to pre-term births. With my amendment, if you wish to leave all
of the liberal approach, giant leap approach in the bill, then you can
do so, because it leaves all of the content intact, but the amendment
gives our LEAs discretion as to how much of this is appropriate to their
locale. It’s like, almost like profanity. It gives the local LEAs an
opportunity to determine how much of this is appropriate for their
students. I commend the amendment.
For all purposes, the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stan wish to
be recognized.
I too, uh, speak on the amendment and then, uh, make motion.
Uh, you recognize to speak on the amendment.
At the conclusion of my remarks, I’m gonna, uh, uh, move the table
because what this is of course is totally gutting the bill. Essentially
it’s just the negative of the bill. It just leaves section two, um, I
think this failure of life in here, we either have to deal with, uh,
prevention of pregnancy or what to do after pregnancy, but you can’t do
both. Well, that’s a failure of life. Some people will get pregnant and
some of them who don’t get pregnant may not get, may refuse to get
pregnant because they realize that they want to have a healthy child
when they’re old enough to have that healthy child. The Speaker,
I move to, uh, that the, uh, that the amendment lie on the table.
Second.

Lucas rely upon the table. All in favor will vote aye. All oppose will
vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.</p>

back on the bill ?? ?? you recognize on speak on the bill
[speaker change] ladies and gentlemen of the house ?? which used to hear
the bay here from members who are presenting a ?? we send them to the
table and there they lie I appreciate this opportunity to speak again on
this bill, you heard lot of the good reason while this is a very bad
bill, we had a lot of debate on yesterday about it there were many
things that were said that needs to be reemphasized today in the things
that ?? say we need to talk a little bit about but i want to first
repeat what about you said ?? its all about entire choice and limiting
axes to abortion, that's really what is all about
[speaker change] ??
[speaker change] ??
[speaker change] we are here for what purpose ?? will be recognized ??
[speaker change]??
[speaker change] ?? i believe that she is attacking the motives of the
person which are ?? rules
[speaker change] noted i would remind the member to not question motives
of the sponsors of the bill
[speaker change] miss speaker i am talking about the bill and thank you
for allowing me to continue to do that and i agree with the lady, it is
my opinion ?? many of the constituency ?? me, that that's what this was
?? is about, i think as i heard ?? ?? talk about the healthy fact and i
wanna say that for our sponsors, co-sponsor the ?? because clearly ?? ??
need to be very wise and educated about their health and that's what
really the goal of that bill was, prior to the ?? for those of who have
just arrived in this chamber the only education in this area that
students receive was ?? ?? now i certainly support ?? but when i look
around and see what's actually going on in the community that is not
worth what young people are doing entirely so that's the reason for to
help the youth and providing for parents, who wanted to choose a better
way, a more comprehensive approach to sex education for their children,
they now have an opportunity to so this, they want just ?? they can
refer ?? chosen to that type of curriculum, so we have that kind of ??
our schools, but i think that ?? inject properly ?? into the curriculum
it promotes an entire choice in the ?? politics over science
[speaker change] ??
[speaker change] again the point of order is attacking motives and
personal credibility of members of the body ??
[speaker change] mister speaker may i ask you a question?
[speaker change] ??
[speaker change] how is my talking about the bill i am not talking about
any people, i am talking about legislation that's what everybody else is
talking about what can i talk about
[speaker change] ?? in the chair has noted that you need to confined
your ?? to the bill and not to the motives of the sponsors ??
[speaker change] thank you mister speaker
[speaker change] if you could ??
[speaker change] i will do that its about the ?? members, let me just
say again that as already been said i think we have to emphasize where
these ?? will be ?? i have four grand children if you have grand
children ?? smart, but i think it remains at risk when we talk about
eleven ?? some of those ?? eleven year old and now are twelve, my grand
sons gonna be ?? is he happens to be quite smart young one ?? but i
think single ?? abortion pretty risk</p>

<p id="055:00">
really not educating our children in terms of promoting healthy
pregnancies, and we have to go back to the medical organizations that
have been cited here that have found no evidence linking abortion to any
later adverse effects on a woman’s reproductive health. I also want to
talk a little bit about the teachers who I’ve heard from. I’ve heard
from a lot of those today who are very, very concerned about what we’re
imposing on them in the classroom now. I think if we’re really concerned
about addressing preterm births, and that’s really what some of this
seems to be about, keeping mothers healthy, why aren’t we increasing
programs to reduce some of the other things that cause it maybe –
diabetes, high blood pressure, alcoholism and so on? And those things
are actually recognized as causes of preterm births, so why aren’t we
doing that? As far as I’m concerned, what this bill boils down to, and
people just don’t like to hear that word abortion, but I think it’s more
about that and more about providing information for children that’s
really not supported by science. Now one of the things that concerns me,
and I think Representative Fisher mentioned that too, is what we’re
doing to mothers who are pregnant. We’re eliminating them from the
budget if they are at a certain income and at a very, very low income,
and so that’s a problem as well. Now I think all of us can agree,
whether you agree with em about abortion or not, I think we can all
agree that we’re talking about children and we’re talking about
education and what will be taught in school, and so I have to agree that
this bill should have gone to the Education Committee. When we talk
about education and we make policy for our educators to follow, the
procedure here has been that those bills go through education. This bill
was heard in Health and Human Services; there was, as has been said, no
public comment allowed in the committee. That’s not the way we involve
our public, by not letting them speak or have their say, and you’re
going to hear from them if you haven’t heard from them already. We
should be concerned about what parents think, we should be concerned
about what teachers think, and we should want to know what they think
about what we’re asking them to teach children in the 6th, 7th and 8th
grades about abortion. We did get input, as Representative Fisher has
said, when we were promoting the Healthy Youth Act. We had several
hearings on that. We heard from the public then. Why aren’t we hearing
from the public now? We allowed input in the Education Committee when
this bill was heard and all the other committees. It didn’t just go to
Education; it went everywhere, and at every stop of the way we were able
to get the input. And then I just want to make a comment about the Child
Fatality Task Force. I think they’ve done a good job in their work, but
obviously we don’t think that. We eliminated them from the budget, and
some of the things I’ve read, they might have been a little bit
intimidated ?? and so they came out with this recommendation. It was not
unanimous. There was contention in the committee; all you have to do is
read the minutes to see that. But nevertheless, today’s earlier
amendments that Representative Farmer-Butterfield had at least made it
somewhat consistent. The last thing I want to say about this bill is I
think the last part of it indicates that the curriculum – it refers to a
curriculum that the health officials will prepare, and I asked a
question yesterday if they’d been contacted and there’s been no
discussion with them about it, and when we started the Healthy Youth
Act, we did have a curriculum that we worked toward that we knew was
going to be included before we actually voted it out, so I think we’re…
probably I can’t say the word that my grandmother would say, but I think
we’re doing it backwards if we want to do it at all, and for those of
you whose grandmothers said the same thing, you know what I’m talking
about, but let me just end by saying that</p>

affects so many women in our community, I would designate Representative

Representative Adams, you are recognized to debate, to speak to the bill
for no more than three minutes.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker I won't need three minutes. It is a very very bad
bill as I've said it's bad for North Carolina. It's especially bad for
our children. We're creating a situation where we're trying to
indoctrinate children. We are levying this kind of-- on teachers we are
trying to get them to teach things that many of them may not even know
about and we have a concern as well about the curriculum which is not
before us. We don't know what people are going to say to our children.
Our parents are concerned. If you haven't heard from 'em, I certainly
have. And when we talk about healthy birth, healthy birth outcomes are
directly tied to healthy birth mothers. And so we need to be concerned
about passing legislation in this house, that would help increase the
ability for mothers who have children, who are having children, to make
sure that those children are healthy and that they're healthy in the
process. There are lots of things that we could do that we could have
done in our budget. And hopefully some of those things will come out but
basically the things that are on the table right now are really
counteracting healthy births. The other thing we have to do - we can not
discredit organizations who have been recognized nationally. Who have
said to this general assembly, who have said to communities,
organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, that there is no link
that would cause or would ?? a cause or risk as it relates to abortion.
This is just another attempt in a long list of bills we've seen that
have come through this general assembly that really create problems for
younger people who might have personal decisions and I'm not calling any
names, but we can all disagree, but I think we have to agree that what
we must give to our children must be the right information. That what
our teachers must be required to teach to children must be the right
information. And we must make sure that our parents are involved in this
process. We have totally left them out. We have not provided an
opportunity for them to have input. They'll read about it tomorrow in
the paper. They'll be calling us after the fact, and that is not the way
we should be operating in this general assembly. That is not the way we
should be. We say we represent citizens in North</p>

North Carolina, whether they're men because I can tell you a lot of men
are concerned about this too because they have the children who will be
going to these schools. It is a bad bill, we should not be shaming young
girls. Vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaking for majority will be the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Fulghum you have three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman I hope this closes a discussion
that has wondered into the weeds. facts are stubborn things. Fact:
Average age of puberty now is about nine years old for girls and boys.
You want to just keep them in the dark for an additional several years
about things that may affect their ability to reproduce, have an
enjoyable life, have a decent chance at not making mistakes that will
come back to haunt them later? Teach them, respect them, tell them the
truth. If the teachers in this state can't take that on as a task then
they're not adequate to their jobs, that's what they do for a living.
And I think the truth is the Child Fatality Task Force is not killed,
it's in the budget for this year. It is true that it's a possibility it
might not be in next year and I've advocated keeping it in for very good
reasons and we'll do our best to make that happen.
4000 abortions were done in 2009 according to the CDC under the age of
15. Children are having abortions, children are sexually active. If you
don't believe your 12 year old driving your car you better wake up. If
you don't believe that nine and ten year olds experimenting with sex you
better wake up. This is a good bill, tells the truth, doesn't hide the
truth, all the risk factors that are mentioned in there need to be clear
to these children. It can be done in a decent scientifically factual
way, annually it can be revised by the public health people that will do
that. I recommend the bill to you, it is good science and it's good
public policy. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will yield Representative Langdon please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it everyone has looked at the bill you'll find
that there's a lot of things in this bill&gt; what we were designed to
do was bring relief to our ag community from small business and large
farmers and Department of Agriculture stakeholders. Agriculture
continues to be the foundation of our state, it's a 70 plus billion
dollar industry.</p>

Always close to 20%, employs close to 20% of North Carolina work force
and brings 6%, it grew 6% during the recession. We need to do all we can
to help the industry.  And this bill does that. Part 2 of the bill
provides the producers certified but yet USDA, GAP and GHB audit
verification program or similar program designated by the Commission of
Ag. Have rebuttal ?? against charges of negligence.  Part 3 eases the
worry for petting zoos and animal exhibits and educational programs
using animals in their curriculum with insurance. One of the issues that
we’ve had in recent history is our, and we’ve even had some tough times
this year when petting zoos were not available because the farmers could
not get insurance.  So that’s an important kind of connection that we
needed to actually fix.  Part 4 gives North Carolina Department of
Agriculture Boards, Commissions and Divisions with authority to access
civil penalties to access ?? monetary penalties when appropriate. It
addresses the underlying violations. Part 5 decreases the frequency of
the survey of persons who withdraws 10,000 gallons per day or more for
agricultural purposes from annually to biannually. And this is a water
draw. Part 6 provides with that no information collected by the
Department of Ag. or its animal health programs, including certificates
of veterinarian inspection, animal medical records, laboratory reports
and so forth, to protect the private business when they do that. Part 7
corrects the name of the Structural Pest Control and Pesticides
Division.  It was Structural Pest Control Division. That changed and was
already been in place so we needed to change that name that happened in
2006. Part 8 would allow retailers to advertise eggs for sale in the
same matter as other produce.  And retailers have asked for this. We had
different signage for eggs so, in the grocery store they had to do it
different, because it had to be a certain height and all that kind of
stuff, and what we’re doing is to allow them to do it the way they do
everything else. Part 9 repeals the Interstate Pest Control Compact.
They have, was formed in 1968 but is no longer in use so this is to, the
Department of Ag. takes care of these kinds of things now in another
way.  Part 10 will conform setback distances and burn times for debris,
stumps, brush and other flammable materials resulting from ground
clearing activities occurring to current state statutes.  Part 11
repeals the sulfur content standards and gasoline found in GS11926-.2
and what it now is the standards, EPA standards so we didn’t need,
excuse me, didn’t need that.  Part 12 exempts forestry and civil ??
operations from the Department of Transportation to temporary driveway
permit processes for state roads except for controlled access
facilities.  If a temporary driveway operator has complete, completed an
education course on Timbering Access and obtains safety certifications.
This is for forestry.  Part 13 exempts migrant housing from requirements
for insulation of an, I have an automatic sprinkler system, itbuilding
meets certain building requirements.  The requirements are real strong,
migrant housing is safe because of what it’s constructed of so that’s
not a real big problem. And part, the next part, in addition Part 13
allows foreign building that is used for public or, for private ??
events, such as weddings or other things, to remain to be foreign
buildings, they don’t have to actually meet some of the guidelines.</p>

Part 14 repeals the prohibition on retails displaying more than 400
square foot, feet, of nursery and stock in their parking lots. Nurseries
sell products by vision, people seeing them, so this allows them to have
more than 400 square feet. Part 15 provides the current exemption from
the Dam Safety Act of dams constructed to provide water for agriculture
purposes.   Part 16 provides nothing in the statute governing water
shortage emergencies to limit a landowner from withdrawing water for use
in agriculture activities when the water is withdrawn from surface water
sources located wholly on the landowners property. In other words, his
pond. Part 17 directs the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources and Department of Transportation to jointly petition the U.S.
Corps of Engineers to allow for greater flexibility and opportunity to
perform wetland ?? litigation outside the watershed where development
occurs. And finally, accelerate the sunset date of the petroleum
displacement plan to effective dates of this act. There's a lot of
information here and I remind everybody in the House this bill probably
has been vetted better than any bill we've had because it went to Ag for
two meetings, then it went to Judiciary and I think they spent two
meetings on it.  So it's a very well vetted bill and I would appreciate
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House.  I would
like to reiterate Representative Langdon's closing remark.  This bill
represents an enormous collaboration over a great deal of time by a lot
of different people and like you said it went to Ag twice, it went to
Judiciary twice, and I'd like to commend Representative Jordan and
Representative McGrady and also Senator Jackson and the people that
worked on  this in the different departments.  It was a great
collaborative effort.  Mr. Speaker I suggest that it might facilitate
discussion on this, I understand that Representative Glazier has a
couple of amendments.  I would suggest that if it is okay that we
recognize him for those amendments at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  To set forth several
amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If the gentleman will state the amendment number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The first amendment number would be ATQ-33, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is amendment ATQ-33.  Representative Glazier
moves to amend the bill on page 2, lines 29 through 32 by rewriting
those lines through read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and I would agree with what
Representative Dixon said that a tremendous amount of work was done and
I appreciate all of the opportunity that all of us had to participate in
JB and in Agriculture and Representative McGrady and Representative
Jordan and this amendment along with the other two have been negotiated
with Representative Dixon and through Senator Jackson with
Representative Langdon and basically this is a request modifying what we
did in the Judiciary Committee on part 2 of the bill and it simply makes
it clear that when we're talking about granting effectively immunity or
a higher burden of proof that there has to be some limitation on it and
the limitation that we agreed upon is that no facility had been engaged
in a circumstance where they had a judgement against them or settlement
as final settlement of litigation exceeding $25,000 where they admitted
liability where there was a connection to something they did that caused
death or injury or illness to a consumer.  Again I believe this is a
consent amendment and would urge adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, I urge you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate.  If not, the
question before the House is passage of the amendment set forth by

amend the bill on page four, line nine, by rewriting the line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, again this is a consent
amendment.
This simply says that if you are in these types of actions, going to get
immunity or a higher burden of proof to prove anything. The person who
is seeking the defense, simply has to plead the affirmative defense of
the consumer. Assume the risks for the spectator, assume the risk of the
equine activity or the farm animal activities, so that it's clear that
they're pleading that there was an assumption of risk. This is standard
and it's in other parts of the statue. I know of no objection. [SPEAKER

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members I encourage you to support the amendment.

the Senate bill 638. All in favor vote aye. All opposed, vote no. Record
the vote for the note. All members please record. The clerk will allow
the machine to record the vote. 112 having voted in the affirmative,
none in the negative, the amendment passes. Representative Glaizer,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To set forth the final amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to set forth the amendment. The clerk will
read. This is amendment ATQ-36. Representative Glaizer moves to amend
the bill on page six, like 28, by inserting the word
&quot;physical&quot; ?? contact. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. Again this is a consent amendment and if you'll notice on page
six, all it does is make clear that the contact we're talking about is
direct physical contact, not indirect. Aromatic contact, which might be
a real issue in these cases. So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] President Ablouze,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glaizer will
yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glaizer, does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glaizer, why is it
that we have the equine activities have their on set of torch standards?
Why aren't general torch standards considered good for all other human
activities and endeavors good enough to cover the equine and how many
other activities have their own specialized torch laws? Will
Representative Ablouze actually completely agree with that. But this is
a compromised bill that I'm not the proponent of. I'm simply trying to
find the compromised middle ground and I agree with your position but
you might better ask Representative Dickson or Langdon.
I do think that there is some testimony before the committee that there
is a need to have some additional protection in certain circumstances. I
think that the committee tried to roll it back  to legitimate
proportions in events that are inherently risky. And they certainly are
in these activities, so I'm not maybe answering as as you wish. But I
think it's a compromise position. On a personal level, I don't disagree
with what you're saying. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dickson,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, I encourage you to vote for the amendment.

Sent forth by Representative Glaizer for the House committee substitute
number two Senate bill 638. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no.
The clerk will record the vote for the note. The clerk will allow the
machine to record the vote. 108 having voted in the affirmative, 1 in

McGrady, please state your purpose.

is recognized to speak on the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
hesitated to rise after Representative ?? comment. But I did want to
point out that one of the changes that were made in the bill as it came

[Speaker Changes] And I appreciate it. It actually, the code section
that was being changed in and referenced in this bill, as it related to
a wide race group of farm animals, is also the code section that applies
to equine activities. And with the consent, all parties of that bill, is
included in this. It passed the House by a vote of a 116 to nothing, and
I might add, with Representative Blust supporting the bill. And I would
too add my thanks to the chairmen, both Chairmen Jackson on the Senate
side, and Chairman Dickson and Langdon and my colleagues. This bill has
had a lot of vetting in two different committees and I think its a
really fine reflection on  I wish the way we could always work on

and Gentleman of the House, we are going to be taking a recess in a
moment. I’ve got what may be a bad news/good news announcement. The bad
news is that we are going to be having a supplemental calendar. The
Chair anticipates probably only one bill that I think would be
considered potentially controversial, and it will be subject to a
committee meeting that would be held during recess. So today, we could
be here for a few more hours. However, next week, we will have skeletal
session every day next week, and there will not be committee meetings.
The members will come back a week from Monday, and we will provide more
information when we come back for recess. Ladies and gentleman, before
we leave though, if I could get your attention before we leave.

[Speaker Changes] This is great day in the history of the General
Assembly when we are about to lose Jerry Dockham, its his last day. And
this is a milestone in what I have been knowing him for around 22 years
and serving with him either as his seat mate or quasi seat mate and I
certainly am sorry that he’s leaving but I am glad he has a golden
parachute and he is moving right down the street, and if your power
rates go up, we know who to call. You know you learn a lot about
somebody by serving with him. You know, you don’t know him as well as I
do, but most of you heard a couple days ago when Bobby Harold Barbie was
eulogized, that Jerry Dockham was a slumlord. And it was so bad over
there that when the thieves broke into the apartment that..</p>

…felt sorry for him and wouldn’t steal anything. He is known as a slum
lord.
Jerry and I have one thing in common, we both went to Wake Forest. We
sit next to each other at the basketball games and the football games.
Our tickets are next to each other. I have known him when both his boys
went to Wake Forest. And his father played basketball at Wake Forest.
And when his boys were going to Wake Forest, we had a little period when
our football team wasn’t winning. I asked Jerry to ask one of his boys
what was wrong with the team, and Jerry said, “Well, they said they were
in the process of rebuilding.” That was 15 years ago.
Last week Jerry and I went to the Deacon Club here in Raleigh, and
somebody asked the coach what was the problem with the football team,
and they said, “We’re in the process of rebuilding.” They’ve been
rebuilding for 15 years.
I can’t think of things to say about Jerry other than he is a
quintessential gentleman. He’s a great dresser, and he’s the kind of guy
that you want in your foxhole. He and I have had, we fought political
wars together, we’ve had dinner together, and we have become the best of
friends.
And Jerry I will miss you greatly, and I’m glad you’ll still be in town.
And you jave made this place a better place for your service to the
state of North Carolina. And we are honored that you served and we’re
sorry that you’re leaving.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, I thought it’d be appropriate since I’m a seatmate to
Representative Dockham, that I would say something nice on his last day
here in the General Assembly. It sort of puts me in a quandary because
I’m really not in the habit of saying anything nice about anybody unless
they’re dead.
But anyway, you know, I thought it was quite an honor for me to be able
to have Representative Dockham for a seatmate. Having suffered for so
many years with Danny McConnis as a seatmate, and I thought, “Well this
is a real step up.” And then I found out that he and Representative
Daughtry drew straws to see who would sit next to me, and he lost.
I’ve enjoyed sitting with Representative Dockham. You have been a fine
seatmate. You’ve been a good mentor. I’ve observed you through the
years. You know, Jerry Dockham is a rare political animal. Years and
years ago the seat was filled with a fellow Charles Cromer,
Representative Charles Cromer. And then he was tapped by Governor Martin
to become his legal counsel, and he resigned. And Representative Dockham
was appointed to that seat.
This is 12½ terms. He served 20 years in this seat after being
appointed, before somebody got up enough nerve to challenge him. He
never, he didn’t have elections, he didn’t have primaries, he didn’t…
And I believe four years ago he did finally pick up a primary and then
maybe a general election in the last go round. But we just wish you the
best of luck in your new role as a member of the Utilities Commission.
I’m going to miss you because you’ve been my IT man. You’d bring the
computer and you’d always find that bill that was on the computer when I
couldn’t find it. So I’m going to miss you for that.
Everybody talks about Representative Holloway being Wasp 101, and we
have Representative Burr who is Wasp 102, but you were the original Wasp
100. You were setting the standards for dress long before these young
sprouts ever came along. You always had the little bow tie, and the
seersucker suits and the polished shoes. So I’m glad that they learned a
little bit from you as far as the dress codes. I never learned. None of
that ever rubbed off on me.
I’m sorry that his wife, Louise, is not here today. But she was in the
balcony yesterday, and we were sitting there talking. I don’t know what
we were talking about, and then all of a sudden he got a text from his
wife and he says, “You need to sit up and behave and keep your mouth
shut. Yeah you need to behave.”
But anyway, I would like to say sincerely from the bottom of my heart…</p>

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's a sad day here when we do have to bid
farewell to Representative Dockham. I'm glad Representative Starnes has
instructed the junior members to follow Representative Dockham's style
in dress, but really the reason I'm sad is something even more important
that we should seek to emulate Representative Dockham in. In the eight
years that he and I have served together, we've been on the same side of
some issues, and we've been on the opposite side of some issues. And I
can say that at every single one of those occasions, he's conducted
himself in a way that brings great credit on this institution, and it
truly has been an honor to serve with him. I didn't agree with him on
everything he did here, and I'm pretty sure on the Utilities Commission
I'm not going to agree with him on everything he does there, but I know
that our state is in good hands and the Utility Commission is getting
someone who carries our state's best interests in his heart. And we'll
miss you, Jerry, but glad you're still serving the state.

Thank you. And I want to just tell the body, just how great it has been
to be with Representative Dockham over the years, because he came in the
short session of 1990, and I came in January 1991, so we have a long
history together, and I think an excellent friendship. We have just been
friends over the years. We disagreed once or twice on issues, but our
friendship has never wavered, and it's always been a pleasure to work
with you, Jerry, and I will not forget you and I will think of you when
you're over there, making better money than we are, at the Utilities
Commission. God bless you.

Thank you. I just want to stand and briefly acknowledge Representative
Dockham. Fine gentleman, I love your style in dress, great bow ties. One
of the things I would say, it's been a real pleasure to work with you.
Last year at this time, you might remember that I was in a wheelchair,
broke my left ankle and Representative Dockham was always asking me
about it. But he was also giving me some advice about how to move around
with a cast, because he had had a previous fall and a problem with his
ankle as well. It's been a real pleasure to work with you. I would ask
that you would do one thing for me. We talked about the Brims and Bows
Day and so if you will give us a good referral, I would certainly
appreciate that, and we'd look for you to come back when we do Bows and
Brims Day. But it's been a real pleasure to work with you, you've been
not only a statesman, but you have been just a very kind and supportive
colleague, and I really have appreciated that. Thank you very much and
good luck to you.

I'll make this very short, but very sincere. I'm going to miss you so
much, Representative Dockham. And when I first came here he just made me
so welcome, and he's always stood by me. And the bottom line for us has

what’s really in the best interest of Davidson County, and he’s always
done that and I will miss him and appreciate him more than he will ever
know. It’s very important for a Freshman to have someone really great in
their delegation to look up to and I had that in spades. So thank you
Jerry, for everything. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

I’d like to share a story about Representative Dockham. My Freshman year
here, I introduced a bill and it was a healthcare bill. The rules chair
immediately sent that bill to insurance and Representative Dockham was
the chair, and this just shows you how honest and straightforward and
kind gentleman he is. I went to his office and I said, Representative
Dockham, I’m a Freshman here and don’t know all the processes, but I
have a feeling that my bill was sent to you for a certain reason, was it
sent there to be killed? He said, Representative Tolson, I was told to
move that bill very, very slowly. He did. It took another whole session
to get that bill heard. But I really...I thanked him for his honesty,
because, being a Freshman, you thought you understood, but a fine
gentleman he is, that started a friendship that I really enjoyed knowing
Representative Dockham and working with him over the 18 or 17 years that
I’ve been here. We’re going to miss you, and I wish you well in your new
endeavor.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would never compete with some of my colleagues
and the great remarks they’ve made today to make a smile, but I just
wanted to speak briefly about the personal sacrifice that all of us make
every day to serve here, and it is a challenge for each of us. I can
remember that there’s been many times when I’ve wondered how do you keep
it all in balance. How do you do it all. Jerry was kind enough to talk
to me one day and he said, you know, I can remember when my kids were
younger and we would be here in session and that I would drive home to
coach their teams at night and then drive back and how tiring that was,
but he kept his commitment to the people back home and he kept his
commitment to his family. Family’s kind of really what this is about.
Many of you in this room remember former Representative Arlie Cook.
Great guy, good friend of mine. I was blessed. He’d probably say he was
not, but I was blessed to have him as my seatmate for about six years
and Arlie’s a great guy, he doesn’t have any family left. But Jerry and
his wife have continually reached out to him and would always invite
Arlie over on special days. For instance, they would invite him for
Thanksgiving lunch, which Jerry would tell you means that Arlie would
get there about 8:30 AM so that he could be on time and be prepared. I
have learned so much about the decorum and the dignity with which you’re
supposed to carry yourself. Representative Tolson spoke earlier about
sometimes we all have to do things here that we may not like, and
there’s sometimes that we have to oppose each other on issues and
Jerry’s done a very good job of standing on his principles and being
willing to disagree, but he’s always done so in a way that he was never
disagreeable. I think that is an admirable skill. It’s one that I hope I
can learn to be more like you. You’re a tremendous asset to this house
and to this state, and I just wanted to say thank you as well. Thank you
Mr. Speaker.

North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose does the Gentleman from Eckleburg
Representative Riley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman has the floor to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. This Bill had a very
vigorous debate, was displaced and sent back to the House Committee on
transportation.  It is turned into a study. It requires the DOT to study
the idea of running a test on four roads currently marked as 70 miles
per hour with a low incidence of accidents. To evaluate the possibility
of doing a 75 miles per hour speed limit from the data gained from the
study and from the test but it raises no limits and it does no tests.
It's simply a study and would be happy to answer any questions.
Hopefully, there would be none.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose does Lady of Eckleburg, Representative
Carney rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady has the floor to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker and Ladies and Gentlemen of
the House I've been quite vocal about this and committee and would have
it on the floor if we debated it then.  I have had numerous emails about
this issue but I’m going to share some issues that I have had since the
study was voted out of transportation committee and it's very serious.
We’ve had some joking about it...laughter, but this is a serious issue.
I'm not sure how you do a pilot on an interstate of whether somebody can
see how many people drive that fast...70 or 80, or on four roads but I
will say this. We have not acknowledged what the driver limitations are.
I've had calls for a study by DOT. If we're going to look at this
seriously, and we want to look at the safety of the people of this
state, then let's do it right and let's look at it and these are the
things that were pointed out to me.  We haven't taken in consideration
the driver limitations on our freeways...on our aging freeways.  We have
not taken in consideration the highway workers and emergency responders
on our highways. We have many of our 70 mile per hour routes, and this
is an engineer, that have wet crash problems. Many 70 mile per hour
routes are posted at their maximum engineered designed speeds. We have
unofficial crossovers, bridges, overpasses that need to be closed. It
would be beneficial and I will point this out, to hear from the highway
patrol, the trucking industry...and here's one we haven't even thought
of, the judicial branch that routinely reduces speeding citations via
plea down and ? for judgments. So we haven't talked about what is the
cost to design highways to maintain an 85 miles per hour speed.  DOT
should, again, be given at least a year and we should fund them to do a
comprehensive study of moving in that direction for our roads in the
state. It should include full freeways not partial or limited ones...</p>

Representative: …should include safety advocates and not just us
political people. We need to address speeding citation adjudication
practices, unofficial crossovers, medium and ride shoulder widths, ramp
design lengths and trucking impasses. I don’t know how many of you even
thought about that when we were talking about moving up the 75 miles per
hour. So I appreciate the speaker, or whomever, moving this back to the
transportation committee so we did not just blow out of here, no pun
intended, to pass 75 mph. I really think this is a serious issue. I
think that a lot of people would rather see us, rather than saying that
a committee here within the legislature will take a look at four lanes,
let’s look at this seriously. I am going to have to vote against this
today as it is standing, and would urge you to do the same. Let’s come
back and put together a comprehensive study for our department. We are
putting the liability on somebody when they say, within the department,
this road is good, if we don’t look at all of these issues that have
been pointed out to me in numerous emails from those who design these
roads and build them. So I would ask that you do not support this bill.
Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick,
Representative Ahler , rise?
Representative: To see if Represenative will yield for a question.
Speaker: Does the lady from McClemborgh yield?
Representative: I will try and…
Speaker: She yields, but prior to stating the question, a motion from
the gentleman in the back on rule 12H is suspended. The gentleman may
now state his question.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mrs. Carney, and I guess to some
degree I am addressing the body as I am asking the question, you realize
that this is a proposal for a project – they will come back with a
proposal this is not a study and a proposal to do a follow up project.
They will have to come back to the legislature to have it authorized.
Representative: I understand that but I just wished that we had a more
comprehensive request of the department to come back rather than just
have a pilot on poor roads.
Representative: Can I speak on…
Speaker: The gentleman from Brunswick, Representative Ahler, is
recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: It’s my intention and hopefully the intention of the
oversight committee, which is comprised of 22 members: half house and
half senate, I hope it is the intention to consider all of these factors
that you have mentioned, as well as any other factors DOT engineers and
attorneys and anybody else involved – I certainly hope they will
consider all of those factors. We would certainly want them to. Thank
you.
Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Dukeland,
Representative Dixon , rise?
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick,
Representative Ahler , rise?
Representative: Mr. Speaker, members of the house, I am opposed to this.
I am opposed to doing any kind of study on increasing the speed limit
when there are so many other things relative to the cost of
construction, the different things we will need. I have been now
hearing, for an enormous amount of time, how short we are of funds to do
what we already need to do, on studying an increase on the speed limit,
when we could we use our manpower, our resources, in a much more
prioritized way than doing this at this time? So I will be voting no.
Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glacier , rise?
Representative: To debate the bill Mr. Speaker.
Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Normally I would think this was a
compromise and would certainly vote for the study. Although, Mrs. Dixon
makes a good, valid point, and I would have been voting for this, but
for the line at the end that says – here is what the result of the study
has to be. You know we were supposed to have a study. We were a divided
house and the study says, again, maybe it should have been more
extensive as Representative Carney says, look at this and I think in the
second part it says look to determine if the speed limit of 75 is
reasonable and safe for the conditions found to exist. Well, assume that
they say it is not, that would be a conclusion they may reach, except we
tell them they cannot reach it in lines 35 and 36 by saying they shall
identify a proposal for a pilot program</p>

For seventy-five hours be limited for segments.  You can't say that they
have an option to say no because they're forced to say yes.  So I think
if you took out lines thirty-five and thirty-six, I'd certainly vote to
at least study it even though I share some of Representative Dixon's
concerns, but I'm not going to vote for a sham study that says no matter
what you've got to come up with four pilots and send it to us.  And for
that reason I'll be voting no.

Representative Hamilton and her assistant rise?

[speaker changes]
Thank you sir.  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I have mixed feelings about
accelerating the speed limits in the state of North Carolina, although
my driving record may demonstrate otherwise.  But, I do believe in
studies in particular when it comes to changing times and changing
abilities, actually changing engineering and the speeds that the roads
now can handle and the safety initiatives that have been taken in most

Steinburg rise?

Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I rise...
[speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you sir.  I'm speaking in opposition to the bill.  My cowboy days
have long since past, although my driving record would not indicate as
much, but I have a real fear of...I know my reaction time and I'm on the
road a lot I'm a guy that used to drive 35-40 thousand miles a year and
my reaction time has really gotten very poor.  If I'm distracted just
for a second and I've got on that cruise control and I'm heading down
the road at 70 miles an hour which is the current speed limit which
means I probably set my cruise control at 72 or 73 miles an hour, and if
I'm just distracted for a moment I find myself running off on the side
and I'm not alone.  There's a lot of us folks out there who think we're
pretty gosh darn good drivers, but this scares me and there's a lot of
people that even when we're testing this...there's a lot of folks who
think that lives will be put in jeopardy as a result.  I don't think
North Carolina roads yet are built for more than 70 miles an hour.  I
just want to stand and say that I am in opposition even to this study.
Thank you.
[speaker changes]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Jeter, rise?
[speaker changes]
To briefly debate the bill so I can go home tonight.
[speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to briefly debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
I own a trucking company and I also know of a rule because I got caught
by it.  There is a rule in North Carolina that if you are caught going
speeding in excess of 75 miles an hour you lose your drivers license for
six months on your first offense.  One mile per hour, if the speed limit
was 75 and you go 76 you lose your drivers license for six months.
That's a law that exists in our books because some of us got caught by
it.  Everyone talks about us passing a bill that's going to allow the
speed limit to go 75 and then we're all going 84.  We don't pass laws
that say the legal age for being drunk is .08 because we know that
everyone's going to be .16.  You have to pass a law with the intent of
people following the law.  There's another law that is extremely penal
when it comes to the standpoint of if you go over 75 miles an hour.  The
idea that this is somehow dangerous or unsafe, I just don't buy that
argument.  And going to Representative Glazier's argument which I think
why he didn't ring the bell today.  There's still time.  He makes the
point that it shall report and he's correct it shall report that to the
joint legislative transportation oversight committee.  That committee
has to accept it.  If that committee says you know what we're not doing
it, it doesn't happen.  That report in and of itself cannot mandate this
study.  Studying this and doing it the way we're doing it makes common
sense.  I'm one of the members of the transportation oversight
committee...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It could, possibly, and I would argue, would put
more of a burden on our law enforcement. It would risk lives
unnecessarily, possibly increase insurance rates. So, to me, when we're
passing a bill, we're supposed to be improving something that was not...
that would... to make it better than it previously was. And on this
particular case I can only see bad. So, I would respectfully request
that you vote against the bill.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Cabarrus, Representative

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I understand that the roads may be engineered
better where they can withstand these kind of speeds and that sort of
thing, might be engineered for that, but the road is not going to have
any hands on the steering wheel. And that... I think what's important
here is the average driver. And the average driver, I guess if you go
and look at that, you got to look at average age, and the average age is
getting a little higher around here in case you hadn't... well, Josh
notwithstanding... it is getting a little higher in this state.  I'm
still a fairly good driver as long as Tammy's with me to make sure I see
everything that I need not to hit, and that sort of thing.  But I am
getting older. My eye's not as good as it used to be. And I have to
admit I used to exceed the speed limit a great deal when I was going to
go courting her when she lived 70 miles away and it took an hour and a
half to get there at the speed limit and I made it in 55 minutes. But I
can't be keeping on doing that. And I just feel like that Representative
Dixon was correct, that we don't need to be committing resources to this
study when we're having a hard enough time figuring out how we're going
to pay for the roads and bridges to start with. I feel like that it's
just an unnecessary idea to raise the speed limit. I don't see what good
it would do except maybe to collect a little more gasoline taxes, and I
just think it's a waste of money and a waste of effort to do a study on
it, and so I'm... I hate to disappoint some of the folks that really
would thought that I'd have gone the other way on this, but I just can't
vote for this bill.  Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the light of Representative Dockham's comments earlier about the
integrity of this body regarding this debate, he might have should have
left during the recess. I'd just like to add a little bit of insight on
this. Again, we are looking at a study and we are looking at a proposal.
It seems like we actually have the joint legislative oversight committee
going on right here making these decisions. And I'm just asking you to
support this bill in the light of what this bill is. Not in the light of
what the bill could be. Not in the light of what the joint legislative
oversight committee may do.  We have plenty of opportunity to look at
this. This bill was just looking at studying the impacts of this. In
regard to Representative Dobson's comments that that... of all the cons
that this bill may do, not... versus the pros, I'd like for us to focus
in on the original intent of this bill as well as... as what this
legislation does, is that it's about interstates. It's about... You have
your lane widths are different on interstates than a secondary or
primary road. Your shoulder widths are different. The ability for you to
move faster is different. So the idea of safety can increase, depending
on what the study does, if everyone is moving more like at the same
speed.  When you have one driver that's driving like Representative
Pittman did in his courting days, versus another driver who's driving
like a 18-year-old, it's a safety issue.  I would ask you to support
this bill.  Let's keep our minds focused on what this legislation is
doing. Thank you.

?? the reason to invest time or money in something studying particularly
as Representative Glazier says the outcome is already dictated.  I keep
asking myself what is the point.  I thing that is what Representative
Dobson was asking.  What is the point of going 5 miles an hour faster?
What is the benefit of this bill and why are we wasting time with it?
When I was doing research on a bill that I have to and hope to bring to
the floor someday I found out that there was over 160,000 citations last
year for drivers who were driving without licenses and without
insurance, 160,000, it was in excess of 160,000.  We have tens of
thousands of people driving on the roads right now  illegally without
any certification that they know how to drive and now we want to
increase the speed limit and give them the latitude to go five miles an
hour faster.  I think that this is a questionable motive.  In fact I
don't even know what the motive for increasing the speed limit is. But I
rise again to speak against this bill because I fear that it may have a
chance of passing.  I think it's a waste of resources and I just think
it is a waste of a lot of time here on the floor today and yesterday.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you  Mister Speaker.  I may be hours late.
People want to go home and I'll try to be brief as well.  I do want to
report to the body of my own study that I have just done and I would
just include in that by letting the folks know that the closest road to
here with a speed limit above 70 miles per hour is approximately 1000
miles away. I believe that I'm correct in saying that AAA, the American
Automobile Association opposes raising the speed limit primarily for
safety reasons. I just read that the American Trucking Association has
actually asked the federal government if they would lower the national
speed limit to 65 miles per hour and one of the primary reasons besides
safety is that they talk about the significant level of fuel consumption
that would be lowered.  I would also remind the body that prior to 1995
there was a national speed limit of 55 miles per hour and our current
speed limit of 70 miles per hour is a 27 percent increase.  That was
before the days of cell phones and other such  distractions and I just
don't think that driving is improved by 27 percent since then. and so
for all these reasons and the reasons that have already been mentioned
I'll have to vote against this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House Bill 568 would de-annex five tracts from the
corporate limits of the City of Asheville for a total of about 675
acres. This property is part of the Asheville Regional Airport. The city
provides almost no services to the airport. It does provide water, but
it also provides water to unincorporated parts of the county, as well as
Henderson County. It will provide fire service or police protection, but
the airport itself has its own fire department and its own police force.
It doesn't provide street maintenance, it doesn't provide lighting, it
doesn't provide zoning, doesn't provide solid waste services. All of
those are provided by the airport itself.
What Asheville does do is collect personal property taxes on the owners
of airplanes, the owners of rental cars, leasehold interests, and it
collects sales taxes on that property. So what this bill does is, since
no great amount of services are being provided by the City of Asheville
to this portion of, well what it constitutes Asheville Regional Airport,
this bill will de-annex the airport from the city. And I ask for your
support for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher, please state your purpose.

<p id="170:00">
Thank you Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House, I arise to
appose this bill, and I'll tell you why.  There's really no reason for
the bill, and there's several reasons not to have the bill.  The airport
was established in the late 1950's by the City of Asheville, acting
alone, no other local governments participated in the purchase of the
property, or the building of the facility.  It has been part of the City
of Asehville corporate limits since 1979, by session law passed here in
1979.  It has served the city well, and the city zoning authority, as
you know, was already limited in a law passed last year.  So this is not
about overly restrictive zoning regulations.  If the airport is no
longer in the City of Asheville, the city police and fire service will
no longer be available on the same basis as it has been in the past.
For example, the City of Asheville fire and police are there on hand for
emergencies, for hazardous duty, for any disasters that might befall the
Asheville airport.  There was a plane crash back several years ago,
where not only Asheville police and fire were on hand, but also local
city businesses were on hand as well.  You all have, I'm sorry to say,
witnessed a string of bills that do the same sorts of things to the City
of Asheville that this bill does.  But let me just say that this
particular taking will result in a loss of revenue from property taxes
collected on the facilities of the airport, of about $193,000 annually.
And that seems like a very small amount in the overall picture to be
pushing a bill forward to take away $193,000 from the City of Ashville,
but let me tell you, in a budget that's the size of Asheville this is a
big deal.  Especially when that city was the city that acquired the land
and built the airport.  So I ask you, I mean I hope you don't see any
more bills like this in this session.  It's been a difficult session for
Asheville, as you might imagine, and for the person who is trying to
speak on their behalf, but I would ask you to think about this, and
think about, really, how necessary is this.  Especially in light of the
fact that the reason that Representative McGrady is running this bill,
is to make sure that property that is at the Ag. Center is turned over
to the county, and so that process is already underway.  Correspondence
is going back and forth between the city and the FAA, and that process
is happening.  This is just, sort of to put an exclamation point on the
city must do this, or else.  And I don't know how you all feel about it,
but often I think the carrot and stick approach is not quite the way to
go about getting people to cooperate.  And so I would ask you please to
vote no on this bill.  Thank you.
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
To speak on the bill a 2nd time.
The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill a 2nd time.
Since the lady from Buncombe raised the issue of why we're running the
bill, and what's the reason for the bill, I want to address that, in no
great length.  As many members remember, we passes the Asheville
Regional Airport bill in the last session.  After we passed it, almost
immediately, the City of Asheville refused</p>

<p id="175:00">
To cooperate, they appointed a public official to the board which was
expressly not permitted under the law that we passed and then as many of
you know when you’re transferring property related to airports and since
most of the money comes from the FAA, you gotta get the FAA to do that
while the city refuse to cooperate. They wouldn’t help transfer any of
the property pursuant to the law that we passed. And so, unfortunately
this bill is a bill that is in the nature of a stick. It’s surprising
once we filed the bill, the city of Ashville has now begun to cooperate
and is actually working with the airport to move the property that
appropriately has to go to the department of agriculture, the egg center
over to the state. And, as the lady from Buncombe knows, I have made a
commitment both to the city council of the city of Ashville and the lady
from Buncombe that if the city continues to cooperate with the transfer
of the land. My expectations is that I won’t move this bill in the
Senate but to keep it eligible, I need to get it over to the senate.
And, since the bill has been introduced, we’ve had a lot of cooperation
and I hope we continue to have the cooperation and I hope we don’t have
to pass the bill but we do need to pass this bill today to get it over
to the senate and I ask your support for the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house. This Bill is the Bill that
was heard in finance just a minute ago, and so I'm going to try to be
respectful of the time given that it is 5:00 on Thursday afternoon. But
I want to tell folks a little about why this Bill has been filed and
what it's all about. Members, this Bill very simply is about property
rights. The in, over in Durham county there is a development that is
known as 751 South Project, being promoted by some folks there, some
developers, some of the family members from the founded ?? industries
that many of you may know that has the LED lights, came up with this
development. What it is it is a mixed use development. It consists of a
tract of land roughly 171 acres located essentially south of where, if
you know where South Point Mall is , on that way down that road as you
go towards ?? County. This, the reason I guess the question is why is a
Bill like this before the legislature.  And this course is Senator
McKissick's Bill and Senator Woodard, although Senator McKissick is the
one primarily pushing this Bill at this point on the Senate part. What
this, the reason I got involved in this, folks, is that these developers
last year, these landowners came to us out of concern of a Bill that had
been filed that was being considered that would have completely shut
them out and denied them access to water. When I talked to them and
talked to a number of folks involved in it I was shocked to see that
kind of thing happening, where a city would deny running water to a land
owner in order to frustrate that land owner's right to develop their
property. This property lies within the county and outside the city
limits of Durham, and this landowner went through the process with the
county, received the proper zoning to build this mixed use community,
where they're going to have an amount of green space that is above
average,. They voluntarily complied with the Jordan Lake rules because
they're about a mile away from the lake. They have agreed to donate land
for schools, for a share of subtation, they've got set aside for housing
?? for affordable housing. They've got a mixed use plan that is the
dream of urban planners. They have followed all of the rules. They went
through the county commission received it, they dealt with the city
initially and then somewhere along the way politics got involved. And
they were denied the access to water. They attempted to find the water
from other sources, but there were issues where the city interfered with
that. The city's basis is the city just didn't want the growth there,
and the way the city enforced it was not through zoning, was not through
anything like that, they complied with all the zoning, was to say you
can't have water. And if you think about it, that's something that
should shock the conscience and concern every single member of this
house. Where any local government in this state would #1 and 2 could
prevent a landowner from having access to water, to frustrate that
ability. But folks, that's what happened. So when the land owners could
not get relief at the local level, they did what they should do and they
have filled to their state government and as a result you have this Bill
that's before you. Now members, this Bill is the result of Senator
McKissick and I worked on this jointly. This it has language in there
that was agreed upon by the landowners, and also in consultation with
the mayor, that they agreed upon.
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="185:00">
The city council rejected the plan by a 4-3 vote at the last minute. But
I assure you that the conversations have occurred with the folks from
the city office and I believe the city planner's office has been
involved, a number of folks. Let me tell you about the water access.
What the developer has agreed to do is to pay for all the infrastructure
costs, every bit of it, and pay double the city rates for the water.
They've also agreed to make millions of dollars of road improvements as
spelled out in here and they have agreed to be annexed. They didn't,
they weren't seeking to be annexed but they're willing to be annexed and
they're willing to allow the city up to ten years to do it, so that it
would be fully, so that it would absolutely be a plus for the city.
There's no way the city is going to lose money on this thing at all.
Members, this bill is here, this bill is about property rights. Now some
are going to get up and say this is meddling in a local issue. Members,
these folks are residents of North Carolina and when we come here and we
take our seats, we swore an oath to represent the people of North
Carolina, not just one county, not just one town, but everybody here.
This project, if approved, is going to give 3000 jobs to people in this
state. There was a public hearing, there were many folks, there were
those opposed and there were those who support it. And the ones who
support this continually said we want this because it will bring jobs.
We need jobs. Folks, that's what this bill is about. Support this bill
and you're supporting private property rights and jobs. That's a message
that we need to send from this state legislature and members, I would
urge your support of this bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, again, this bill goes
against the will of the city council and we know we had basically this
same bill a year or so ago, we know what the result of the vote was. But
I don't rise to speak about that, but I rise to speak about the last
statement made that this project will bring jobs. And what is important
if you are going to get into position of being the city council person
and feel that you have the knowledge to make a decision about this, you
should have full information. And Representative Moore did talk about
several things that could happen, or might happen, should the developer
decide to do it. This legislation does not require him to do anything
except for have the right to get the water and sewer at double the rate.
It doesn't require him to develop the property even if he got it. It
doesn't require him to anything else. I think the big issue that gets
thrown around sometimes is 3000 jobs, sometimes it's 30,000 jobs.
However many it is that is thrown around, and unfortunately a lot of
people get enthusiastic about that without having any enforceable
ability to ensure they're created or measure the progress toward doing
that. And so as you look at the bill in front of you, I challenge you to
look at it and see if it has any reference to jobs in it. See if it has
any obligation on the part of the developer to provide any jobs, or do
any of the other things that were rumored or alleged that might happen
as Representative Moore said. And I'm sure he is of the belief that they
will happen at some point in time in the future. Again, the city council
has voted against this. This is something that needs to get worked out
at the local level, if that's going to happen. And I think the principle
we're violating once again is to override the authority of the local
city council and county commissioners in this case, when they make
decisions regarding land use planning. We don't have the ability, I
would presume or would wonder, are we now going to monitor this project?
Are we going to have them report back to ?? to see if they do all the
things that Representative Moore said, since we're going to step into
the role of City Council? I would think not. So as you go down that path
of displacing city councils and their authority, think about the other
part of the responsibility that comes with that. And so again, think
about what this bill really says. We have a lot of responsibility. I
think this area of development is in Durham. I'm sure it is. And I'm
sure it's in some members' district that they represent. And I'm sure
most of you do not have proper background and knowledge of what has
happened and what is happening in Durham. But I bring you back to this
salient issue of job creation, that is not provided for in this bill.
That is not provided for in any document related to it, and those of you
who are in the Finance Committee heard it. There is no guarantee of any
jobs in this</p>

almost irresponsible for us to say these are gonna be jobs that are

getting created.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, a lot of things
happen when a gun is pointed to your head and some things have to be
done. But let me- We had done something in this bill that this
legislature has never done before. You're doing forced annexation. If
you look at section 2 of the bill, it says &quot;Effective June the 3rd
2023, the corporate limits of the city of Durham are extended by adding
the following described property.&quot; This is forced annexation.  Just
that simple. And I've heard all the arguments not- The other thing is
very simple,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to see if Rep. Michaux would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, you realize that water and sewer is about 16 feet from
this property. So my question is, would you support this project if it
wasn't in the city limits would you support giving them water and sewer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know, because I'm not faced with that question at this point.
What I'm telling you is about the forced annexation that's happening,
that's something that we have never done before and you know there are
other things here. Rep. Hall mentioned the fact that promises have been
made, but there's nothing in this legislation that says those promises
are going to be kept. Certainly we'd love to have 3000 jobs there, but
we've got enough vacant property in Durham right now to do some jobs.
We've got people who are looking for work where jobs just not available.
We don't know what's going on out there, we don't even know whether the
developer is going to stick to his commitment to even build the project
or whether he's going to get the water and sewer out there and sell it
to somebody else. There's nothing in this legislation that guarantees
anything except but the forced annexation of that property out there,
and I ask you to vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well just to correct a couple of things first. First of all, as someone
who worked on forced annexation, at least as much as former Rep. Brown
did, this has nothing to do with forced annexation. That's a completely
different terminology. As we understand it in this general assembly. In
this case it's a really odd scenario where the city is basically
refusing to provide services. Cities are there, creatures of the state,
to provide basic services. Durham won't provide those services. And when
the petitioner's done everything that is, and more, that is required of
them, so it's a very strange situation. And I'll also point out, as one
of my colleagues pointed out a moment ago, we actually do have, in a
different scenario, we do have in our state statutes an opportunity for
people to petition to get in to sort of force the city to annex them. We
actually did that in the bill that we passed two years ago. More
importantly, I think the jobs argument is just a really odd argument to
make. These folks who have invested millions and plan on investing
millions and millions more. They're ready to finally get going, get this
project going, it is a tremendous mixed-use project, it will create
thousands of jobs, it's perfectly positioned for the region's transit
system and the like, it meets all the requirements of the Jordan Lake
rules, it does everything that you could possibly want, and it's being
sponsored by some of the best corporate citizens we have in the state of
North Carolina. There's just really no reason except some very odd
politics over in the city of Durham why they would deny the ability of
these property owners to have access to water. Give them access to
water.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will Rep. Dollar yield for a question?

Will you guarantee that those things that you talked about will be done?
SPEAKER CHANGE
I think it's very obvious that they are going to be done. I can't write
you a guarantee but I think it's very obvious that it's going to be
done. Why will they spend all the mails and dollars and all this time?
Anybody is been able to ?? in that entire area; you know whats going on

Well gentlemen, here for another question.

You ever heard of land speculation where you get things on, and then you

SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Ruth quickly state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Speak on the ?? for the men. Wait for July ?? Gentlemen have the floor.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Thank You Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, first of all I would like
to say that this project is in my legislative district and so I have a
special concern about it; and I will tell you that the issue is not
about property rights. It's about the question of whether a city council
can go through all the different steps that it has done over the years
and decide whether they want a project or not, the council of the
members, the mayor; and twice the city Council Germans voted against
this project, seven to zero the first time, four to three the second
time against the project. Now, I am told that there's something wrong
with the fact that politics got in the way; but we are in a legislative
body and we do politics; they are in city Council, they do politics.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Hastings, please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGE
To see if Representative Lowkey would ?? for a question.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Aye, you
SPEAKER CAHNGE
Representative Lowkey, do we have a constitutional right to home rule
for local governance in the state of North Carolina?
SPEAKER CHANGE
We have the notion of local government that all of us I thought were
elected on a local control and I think I've never heard it as a
Republican principle or not as Republican Principle or Democratic
Principle. I have heard it as principle of I think almost every member
in here that we believe in local control.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Lowkey, do you ??
SPEAKER CHANGE
Sure
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Lowkey, do we have a constitutional right to home rule
for local goverments in the state of North Carolina?
SPEAKER CHANGE
No I fear saying
SPEAKER CHANGE
Thank You
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Lowkey, you may continue
SPEAKER CHANGE
Thank You. I'm focusing on the issue of local control on whether how you
feel about your town and someone deciding due to lobbying of virtually
every member that you've decided you really have the qualifications of
being a city council member ?? and that you on the basis of the
information that you're given, much of which I could challenge if I
wanted to become a civil town 's city council member myself; things like
how far the project is from the water;  its actually a couple hundred
feet in a couple of cases. How many jobs, no one knows where the three
thousand jobs came from, but I don't want to go there, I want to go to
the extraordinary statement by the rules chairman that politics got in
the way of this wonderful project. These projects are subject to the
decisions of the city Council and they have the right to do what they
do, and suddenly here, it seems many ofthe members have become experts
in Dorm politics and dorm decision-making. This doesn't make sense to
me. I think the whole idea that the people of North Carolina have an
obligation to get involved in Dorm politics because my friend represent
more decided two years ago to get involved meddle and dorm politics,
again this year, decided to meddle and dorm politics to the point
members that our mayor has told all of us that he never would've gotten
into involving any conversations about this issue, with represent more,
if he had not been told that represent more would be running the bill
anyway.</p>

As I was saying a moment ago, it is extraordinary to me that everyone is
become an expert in Durham planning issues in making a decision that if
the majority prevails, the people of North Carolina are authorized to
make decisions for the city of Durham.  That’s really astounding to me.
It’s disappointing to me.  I don’t think you would want it to happen to
you that someone 150 miles away from your town decides that he needs a
bill because he thinks he doesn’t like the decisions that the city
council of Durham as made.  This is just wrong and Mr. Speaker  I would
like to send forward an amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Luebke is recognized to send forth an amendment.  The
Clerk will read.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Luebke moves to amend the bill on page 1 line 2 through
the end of the bill by rewriting those lines to read.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Luebke you have the floor.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House with this is a
straight-forward amendment.  It includes all the things that we in the
Durham delegation agree on, all six of us.  It takes out all the
controversial issues around 751 where all has been debating pro and con
as if we were all council members.  It takes all that out.  It allows us
to have this bill for Durham on something about which there is a
consensus.  If you support this amendment, first of all, the bill will
no longer be roll called, so you can finish with this business today.
That would be one practical reason for you to vote yes on the amendment.
 But a second reason to vote on the amendment is this. Here you are
supporting something that everyone on our Durham delegation supports.
There will, if this amendment passes, there will still be a bill that
the rules chairman will bring forward that will focus simply on the
controversial issues around the 751 project.  Then we can have a clean
debate about that issue.  So if you support this amendment, we will be
able to debate the issues of Durham 751 project another day.  But at
least we have here a bill that is a consensus bill, all of us, House and
Senate from Durham.  Thank you.  Move for adoption of the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Gentleman is recognized.
[Speaker Change]
Members, Mr. Speaker, this amendment simply guts the bill.  It takes out
all the provisions protecting the property rights of these landowners.
It is an attempt that the gentleman tried to do in Finance and is trying
to do that again on the floor.  So members if you support this bill,
very simply, please oppose the amendment and vote not.  Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Further discussion or further debate on the amendment?  If not, the
question before the House is the passage of Amendment A-1,
Representative Luebke’s amendment to Senate Bill 315.  Those in favor
will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the roll
to vote.  The Clerk will close the machine and record the vote.   Those
in favor are 136, those opposed 72.  The amendment fails.  We are now
back on the bill.  I am sorry 36, I said 136.  I am getting older.  I am
losing my mind.  Representative Stone, please state your purpose.

cons.  And over several days we heard the stories of this gentleman.
The $9.5 million commitment for road front improvements, the
improvements he is willing to make with the infrastructure through the
property.  Him trying to comply with the mayor and city council.  We
have heard all the stories, and the biggest scenario is there is not a

great bill, an opportunity.  We've talked about jobs.  Representative
Luebke, you stood up, yourself, and said, &quot;Where are the
jobs?&quot;  On all the legislation we pass, &quot;Where is the
jobs?&quot;  We're going to send potentially 3,000 jobs in your
backyard, give or take a thousand, and you're saying no.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Representative Lucas, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Point of order.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Will the gentleman state
his point of order?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Was the gentleman making an
impugning statement toward Representative Luebke?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I
do not believe so.  I believe that the gentleman's point is not well
taken, and the gentleman is debating the bill.  Representative Stone may
continue.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Speaker?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I
wanted to see if Representative Stone would yield for a couple questions
for me.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stone, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I yield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stone,
I've been learning and listening a lot more about this project, and am I
correct when I say that the city regularly sells its water at double the
rate to anyone else in the county?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Currently, the
city, municipality is allowed to sell to anyone outside the incorporated
area at double the cost of water and sewer.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Followup, Mr. Speaker?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stone, do you
yield?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I yield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  And, Representative Stone, didn't this
project offer to do that with the city of Durham, simply buy water at
double the rate and not have this issue of incorporation?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Representative, that's been the question.  They've complied
with everything the city and the county of Durham have offered them to
get something up and going, so they've been willing to be in the city
limits, to not be in the city limits, to pay double the rates.  I can't
imagine an enterprise fund in the state of North Carolina that had
capacity 16 feet from its lines and someone's going to pay for the
complete infrastructure and saying no to the double rates, not one
enterprise fund in the state of North Carolina could I imagine that
happening in.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  And, Mr. Speaker, one more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stone, do you yield?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  I yield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  He yields.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And did the city of Durham offer the developer any reason that it would
treat it different from any other property developer there, by means of
not selling the water at double the amount?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Not only
did they not offer any reason, they're currently selling waters to other
people outside the incorporated area.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll finish
up quickly, because I'm sure your eight or ten more lights have come on,
but you've all seen finance.  We had eight people, after over an hour of
deliberation about this bill, and we had bipartisan support to move
forward.  We all hate that these items come to the General Assembly, and
they should be handled back home.  But sometimes common sense has to
prevail and that's why we do the people's business.  I'd ask you to
support this bill, and let's move forward, let's get the jobs, and let's
promote North Carolina and move forward.  Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To
debate the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House, I'm
just rising since we're all being accused of meddling in the Durham
affairs and trying to be Durham's city councilmen, but I think what's at
issue to most of us is the fact that these are jobs for North Carolina
and North Carolinians.  We all know that when a business expands or
locates here, the people who work there at that business are not always
living right in that county.  We also have tough economic times.  We're
being told again and again by the minority and the minority leader that
we ought to concentrate on jobs.  We have been excoriated time and again
for not taking speculative jobs when we don't take federal money that's
claimed to lead to jobs.  Then the same people that jump on us and
pillory us turn around and, when there's jobs being created by private
investment and economic growth that we covet, we all covet, they don't
want it.  And I just find that</p>

only ironic and Don not understandable. now all these people will
contribute to the income and tax revenue for the state don't be
additional sales tax revenue. a true multiplier of private
investment.this is exactly the way, what we say everybody counter claims
there down here to try to do and then we get a perfect tangible sample
of a project in which you are asking for no money whatsoever from the
state and some do want to turn it down and I would vote against the bill
in this project to come to Guilford or surrounding county that would be
the way you could get me to vote against this bill, but I'm almost
thinking Mister Speaker, we might need to warm a new cost sharing: a
list by caucus or the nihilist caucus because I can't understand why we
won't take these jobs. there's no need for a guarantee because there's
no state money involved. so if it's only a thousand jobs rather than
three thousand. there's no claw back. there's nothing to claw back. we
need to do this. I'm sorry it can be misinterpreted by some as meddling
into local by laws. I represent a complicated purpose will generally

Frost T I don't know myself and paid the sixteen feet someone else in
two hundred feet to actually connect to the water and sewer. but what we
were told the committee was not paid double the rates for these
utilities, so I don't believe over time is going to cost the city a dime
and I think that will more than be made up in property tax revenue and
additional job at a time when people are baking in the state begging for
job. been written the paper we get told about seventy thousand people.
the federal government about to cut off a lot of voters would probably
apply for these jobs. so, I just can't understand what we don't go ahead
and do this and take these jobs. I will support the bill was great to
finish our present purpose, and is ready to quit brother, but you get my
e-mail to you using the job or jobs record of the show. I can't remember
exactly how much is been paid for the property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
already it is going to be invested, but I think it's us. you can assume
that someone that puts this kind of money is going to build the factory
and hire people to run the factory visit in the data centre where you'll
spend twenty million dollars and get sixteen jobs. this is going to be
producing things, there will be production jobs, management jobs,
transportation jobs all kinds of jobs not because there would be needed
to actually make the product distributor. the product and get the
revenue so that the business will make money from them shortly. take a
purpose that I don't get a Hathor, the English figure this is an
excellent project and I'm still mystified as to why my friends and Aaron
did not seem to want this project. some of the leaders of urine that is,
they can pack it up and move it to my county would love. we take it
obvious it is not a practical solution at this property rights is if you
don't support this bill. that amounts to allowing a municipality to use
water as weapon against development water as a weapon, you may have a
municipality in your district that uses water for the same purpose as a
middle of the few that want to monopolize water resources as a weapon,
you may know the few I know of a few. if you do not agree with these
kind of tactics and I would urge you to support this bill. thank you,

As I said in the beginning, I admire you standing by your convictions,
but I think as an old country boy, we're starting off in the wrong
direction.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized for a second time to speak
on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House, all 7
members of the Durham city council, council and mayor, were elected by
the people of Durham, they have to stand for reelection.  And if the
people don't like what was done with this 751 South project, well what
they tried to do with this 751 project in terms of making a decision
about it, the people would vote them out.  That's what we have elections
for in November 2013, and then November 2015.  One time or another,
everyone who voted for or against this project has to stand before the
people of the city of Durham.  And I'm really disappointed, really
disappointed that people do not respect that part of the democratic
process.  Here, it seems many of you have been given a lot of
information that may or may not be accurate, but many of you are using
it to tell us in Durham, tell our city council indirectly through us,
what they should have done.  I would welcome many of you who are now so
well versed as you think on this project that you come before the city
council and testify, and told the city council what the city council
should do.   But to sit here in the State House and decide you don't
like what the council did, and therefor you're going to over-ride the
council, just seems extraordinary.  Would you really want that to happen
in your town?  I don't think really, if you think about it, you'd want
the General Assembly to come in and tell you, and I won't name towns but
I see where everybody's from, the General Assembly come in and tell your
town council that they made a mistake and you're going to reverse their
decision.  It's just wrong.  I know Representative Moore said at the
beginning we're going to hear the word 'meddling', and you are going to
hear meddling because that's exactly what you are doing.  You may think
otherwise, but look the word up, meddling in the dictionary, and you'll
see that if you vote yes on this bill, you have meddled in the issues of
the Durham City Council, and by extension, the issues of the people of
Durham.  I hope you vote no, and I appreciate all of you who vote no in
the name of local control.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The question before the House is the passage of House
Committee substitute  No. 3 to Senate Bill 315.  Those in favor will
vote aye, those opposed will vote no.  The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will close the machine and record the vote.  Those in favor
are 73, those opposed 31.  The House Committee substitute No. 3 to
Senate Bill 315 has passed its second reading and will remain of the
calendar.  Senate Bill 399, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]House Committee substitute to Senate Bill 399, a bill a
bill to entitle and act to amend constitution, to provide that a person
accused of any criminal offense in Superior Court, for which the State
is not seeking a sentence of death, may waive the right to trial by
jury, and instead be tried by judge.  General Assembly of North Carolina
in act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, members of the House, first, just a word
on procedure, this is a constitutional amendment so it's a roll call
vote, but we can do a 2nd and 3rd tonight, but it is a roll call both
times, and if you're out of the chamber, it's like voting no. It
requires 72 votes regardless of how many people vote.  Hopefully it will
be unanimous.  North Carolina Constitution for a long time has provided
that if you plead not guilty in a criminal case, you have to be tried by
a unanimous jury of 12 people.  Now this is contrary for example, to
Federal Court, you know, Eastern District, Western District, except
Middle District where you can be tried by a judge.  It's different than
a lot of states where a person can waive a jury trial.  The purpose of
jury trial, of course, is to protect the defendant from oppression by
the state.  So why</p>

[Speaker changes.]...Why should the defendant not be able to wave that,
with the consent of the judge and that's what this does.  It allows us,
in cases where  the judge agrees, to have a 'judge trial'...not capital
cases but a trial just by the judge if the defendant and the judge
agree.  The rules on that would be set by the General Assembly and
there's also a statute there so the Governor would hafta sign this as
well...that says how to do that. I think it's as simple as that so I'll
sit down unless you have some questions.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Speak to the bill, Mister Speaker.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker and I agree completely with
Representative Stam, this bill was actually well-negotiated and I will
tell you that it is approved by both the North Carolina ?????? for
Justice on the defense side, DA's Conference on the prosecution side,
and it also has protections in it that were negotiated to make sure that
any time a defendant waves the trial, the judge must determine that it's
a knowing and voluntary waiver and I think this is long overdue.  I
would encourage everyone to vote for it.
[Speaker changes.] The question before the House is the passage of
Senate Bill 399 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will let the
machine record the vote.  104 have voted in the affirmative, one in the

[Speaker changes.] It's just a roll call vote.
[Speaker changes.] It is a constitutional amendment vote.  We will take

changes but is there any discussion or debate on the bill before us? The
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 399 on its third reading.  All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.  All members
please record. Representative Farmer-Butterfield. Clerk will lock
machine, record the vote.  104 having voted the affirmative, one in the

its third reading.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman will yield...will be returned to the
Senate.  Representative Martin, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] For Parliamentary inquiry.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman may state his inquiry.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you very much, Mister Speaker and I hope that
is the right form.  This inquiry regards the questioning of other
members and it's prompted by the gentleman from Guilford, Representative
Blust's comments to the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux,
on yielding to questions and this is a sincere inquiry that I don't know
the answer but my inquiry is...does Section 114 of Mason's Legislative
manual, which I spend too much time perusing when the debate goes long.
Does that apply in this body when questioning other members,
specifically the portion that says that does allow members to interupt
other members but specifically notes &quot;unless some good reason
exists, they should wait until the member has concluded speaking&quot;.
[Speaker changes.] The Chair would acknowledge that that may have been
the case in that discourse and in dozens of other discourses over the
course of this session.  Maybe even hundreds. (Breathy laugh.) House

The county's the same cost-containment measures that currently this body
has given the corrections for jail inmate services, and as a good bill
worked with many stakeholders to address the different needs. And I
think there's a good bit of consensus on that bill.  There is an
additional provision regarding the District Court judge appointments,
and I'd be happy to stand and answer any questions on this bill [Speaker
changes]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose [Speaker changes]
To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker [Speaker changes]
Stand and be recognized to debate the bill [Speaker changes
Thank you, Mr. speaker. I am in full agreement with the first three
sections of the bill which I know have been worked on, and I think in
fact I had a corresponding bill with several others in here on the House
side. I don't disagree with it at all.
But section 4 was added, and I'm going to speak to section 4. One of the
reasons I stayed without going on to something I needed to do, was to
speak to this section.  The law that's being changed by PCS added in
rules without any discussion prior to that, without any notice to the
bar, without any notice to judges, changes the whole selection of the
District Court judge bench in North Carolina.  The rule in North
Carolina up until today was that if there was a vacancy in your District
Court bench, that the bar met of that area and nominated three
candidates to the Governor. The Governor then was to select one of those
three with that being as good a vetting process as we have in this
state. And if the Governor failed to appoint a bar nominee within 60
days, the bar then the person who received the highest votes would
receive the nomination. The attempt to do that years ago when Democrats
were in control, was to keep the politics as much as possible - given
what we're talking about - out of the merit selection of judges at the
District bar for vacancies. And that was to keep people like Mike Geezly
from making a political decision, and people like Bever???? from making
that decision. Because the understanding was that those members of the
local bar knew their lawyers the best. They knew who was showing up in
court and who was doing the job, and who wasn't.  And they nominated
folks, three people, so that cliques in the bar couldn't just nominate
one, or party politics would be minimized, because hopefully there were
enough that you'd get a good quality assortment of candidates.  And the
Governor didn't have to choose the first or second nominee, but he or
she had to choose one of the three.
And that was done as the country has moved, as Justice O'Connor has long
argued, to as much merit selection as we can. That's not to say that in
certain bars, there weren't politics played. And it's certainly not to
say that the Governor's level of politics didn't get played about which
of the three.
This bill removes any check and balance. This bill says, as I read it,
the Governor now may choose one of the three, but doesn't have to. They
can choose anybody they want.
That is moving us in the completely opposite direction from what the
country's doing.  It is moving inordinate politics back into the
process.  It diminishes the quality of what we're doing. It diminishes
the integrity of the appointment. It takes the local bar out of the
process, and it is fundamentally wrong.  I wouldn't vote for it if
Governor Easly was governor, or Governor Hunt was governor, or Governor
Purdue were governor, and I'm not going to vote for it now. And it has
nothing to do with party or politics, but it has everything to do with
what I believe is the integrity of the process.
Now someone may suggest that my reading's wrong, and I will certainly
withdraw my comments. But I've read through it a bunch, and I've talked
to people. And I believe that's exactly what this bill does in this
provision. I really don't care who it's for or why it's done, but it is
wrong. And we should vote against it and have that provision taken out,
and let the bill go as forward. But to say that we're gonna undo the
only merit selection check we have on appointment of District Court
judge vacancies is, to me - with due respect to my colleagues -
absolutely wrong. Thank you. [Speaker changes]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.</p>

to speak to the bill the gentleman ?? the bill
[change speaker]
thank you. members the first three sections are agreed upon provisions
that were worked out among the county commissioners association and the
folks at the hospitals. the final provision was, i understand that i did
speak with a representative from the bars the association that they
weren't going to take a position on the bill with that provision.?? came
from a broader bill that represented ?? and there were some provisions
that were deemed controversial. this provision as i understand was not
deemed controversial. but the way it works right now and i think its an
interesting conundrum is if there is a vacancy in a district court
judgeship the attorneys in that district get together and submit thee
names and the governor must pick from those three names. now i;m a
member of my local bar but nobody elected me in that bar and no body
elected any of those attorneys  so why should an unelected group
unaccountable to the public have the right to control who the governor
who is elected we don't have that requirement on superiors court judges
who do death peaty cases ore several cases involving generally more
money, the felony cases, the governor simply appoints a superior court
judge and there is not any input from the bar.  It's the same when there
are other vacancies in other offices. the appeals court, the supreme
court, at least at this way, the governor appoints whom ever the
governor deems appropriate from that area.  Ive always had a problem
with the fact that attorneys who are not allocated int he bar make that
selection. that just seems as un-democratic ca process as i can think
of. Are there politics involved in judicial appointment, there probably
are its just a different type of politics when you have a bunch of
lawyers in the room narrowing down the list of who the judge can
appoint.  Mrs turner has probably sen this sort of thing I't's the
reality folks.
[change speaker]
representative miss shaw please speak your purpose.
[change speaker]
will the gentleman answer the question
[change speaker]
representative Moore i'm ?? why this was not run through the normal
process through a j committee, somewhere so it could be vetted without
it being added to a bill that came out - that's my question why was it
not handled in the usually course of business?
[change speaker]
it's the representative that shows that bill had been pending a while
and there was parts of the bill that when it came up for discussion i
think were deemed controversial and everything i heard so far was that
this was a controversial it got the attorneys in here worked up and i
know she all get worked up in things hen everybody is ready to go home
but i didn't  believe it was controversial it was just failure
[change speaker]
but even with it's deemed fail. why not let it go through the regular
process and you get the same result wouldn't you? When you start talking
about judges and the judicial system and all that, it comes a very
sensitive area and I think that just adding this in here now without any
bedding accept on the floor here is just wrong and particularly when you
put it in a bill that you know is a good bill thats going to have to
pass anyway, this is just seemed a little under handed to me.
[change speaker]
My response simply is you've been here longer than i have and we've seen
plenty of times where you take a senate bill and you add some things to
it and send it back and that original senate bill ad nothing to do with
what we put in, we've always done that, i know that and look at what i
think we had ab ill earlier on the counter and we did a pcs on some
hints it's the end of session and were hoping to go hoe here at the end
of the week if we start running things through a whole committee that
just simply kills the whole idea
[change speaker]

because</p>

<p id="250:00">
Does it make it right?  Two wrongs make a right? I mean, just because it
was done, I mean, we certainly all of us are guilty of having done these
things but here again when you come to sensitive things like judges and
the judicial system, I think you ought to have, well you know.  Do you
think just because we’ve done it before it’s right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would, I would never say that but I will say that I don’t think it’s
wrong.  I think that when we do  a PCS to a bill that’s part of the
process and in all candor, I’m surprised that there’s any controversy
about the provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady may state her motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, in light of all the discussion that we’ve had, and the
concerns that have been raised, I would move that we refer this matter
back to a Judiciary Committee to review this matter.  And it could be
the full judiciary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t think there’s a motion, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady’s motion is to re-refer to Judiciary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just, I would respectfully ask the lady if we could avoid doing
that, I mean I’m assuming somebody’s going to object to third and if
they are then we’ll get to deal with it on July the 8th. So we can all
just kick it around between now and then if you want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may make an inquiry?  ?? chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his, or the lady may state her inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  This has already met crossover, so is there
even a problem if we wait and deal with it in the short session?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I mean we could take that philosophy and I guess adjourn and go home and
not deal with a lot of things but I think we probably ought to, we
probably ought to do it so if, I mean I’ll be glad to object to second
reading, to third reading if you want to just want keep it over. So I
would ask members, I would ask members to either vote no on the motion
unless the lady wants to withdraw the motion with the understanding that
we’re going to object third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion? Representative Burr,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I would just respectfully ask to speak on the
motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I would ask that members oppose the motion you
know I, this is something that’s been tossed around this year.  It’s
been out there and you know it’s simply removing the requirement that
the Governor have to appoint who they recommend.  It’s not tying the
Governors hands anymore.  This is as Representative Moore mentioned, not
a requirement for all the other judicial positions, the Supreme Court,
Superior Court, the Court of Appeals. I think this is something we can
continue to take up on the floor and continue the discussion as we go
through third reading and we can have, if I would ask respectfully that
members vote no on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion? Representative
Jackson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, ladies and gentlemen if you’re watching
dashboard you’ll see that I have an amendment already put in a few hours
ago to take the section out of the bill. But I think the better of the
process is to refer this back to Judiciary to do that and I just want to
talk about the process a little bit if I could on my motion. It’s a
shame that Representative Dockham gave his farewell speech and said
respect the House to everybody earlier today, because as of 5:30 last
night when the PCS was sent to me, this provision was not in the bill.
In fact, it just showed up at 2 something when we showed up in Rules
Committee. Representative Moore says he doesn’t know of any controversy.
 The reason why he doesn’t know of any controversy’s cuz nobody knew
this was on the table for today until he slipped it in Rules.  He is
Rules Chairman. He’s got 50 bills in his Committee, he could gut and
amend any bill he wanted to run this individual provision by itself.
But he don’t want to do that, he wants to tie it to something that a lot
of people, the hospital associations, county commissioners, the
sheriffs, a lot of us local, our local hospitals have worked very hard
on to get this bill through.  This, you know I, one thing I want to say
is I thought Pryor Gibson left last session. And those who serve with
Pryor know exactly what I’m talking about.  Because ?? do.  But that’s
what this is.  It’s not necessary.  We can run this bill if you want to
have that debate with, let’s have that debate another day. I’d ask you
to support this motion.

thinking and I think we agree that this is very important that we work
with our prison system. I’m appalled to see that we have something else
added there and I think we ought to have this go back to the J committee
and see if it ought to be there. Let’s at least have some debate on it
because I think the first three parts of this are just too important for
us to be confused about it.

Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don’t say this for any other reason than to
explain how deeply some of us feel about this bill or this provision. An
hour and a half ago I was  supposed to be home at my own fundraiser. I
stayed and I’m not at it for a lot of reasons, but this was the main
one. We’re elected here to do our job and to do it and think through
things thoughtfully and intelligently and in an informed manner. We are
here to do the right thing, not for any special interests or groups and
I think almost all of us believe that and do that on both sides of the
aisle. This is a judiciary change. If a matter that changes how we
appoint the judiciary ought not go to a judiciary committee, what
should? Representative Stevens is right. There may be, in the end, votes
to do it or not, but it deserves to be heard in a judiciary committee.
We deserve to hear the members of the bar. We deserve to hear the
judiciary comment on it. We deserve to hear the bar comment on it. That
is fundamentally what we should be doing to make any kind of intelligent
decision on this. We are talking about the future of the appointments of
the judiciary of North Carolina. I totally support Representative
Stevens motion to re-refer to judiciary and hope that we will all do so.
Maybe, if we’re lucky, by consent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Volley please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d ask Representative Glazier a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, this takes some of the decision making process
out of the hands of the attorneys. Isn’t the bar association, I mean the
judiciary committee made up primarily of attorneys?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The judiciary committee, I think, has a mixture in our body of attorneys
and non-attorneys. Obviously a lot of attorneys are on it, some, I
think, are on commerce. I haven’t looked at the combination.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First off, I wanted to let Representative Jackson know I’m not ?? for
one. If I was I’d be talking about toolboxes and catfish, I guess. But
we did actually find a technical issue so as a result of the technical
problem we found, I told Representative Stevens I’m going to join her
request and withdraw my objection that the bill go back to judiciary
because there’s a problem that needs fixed with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the consensus motion to send the
bill to judiciary. If not, the question before the House is the motion
to re-refer the House committee substitute to Senate Bill 321 to
judiciary. All in favor vote aye. Or if the gentleman removes his

Well, speaking of things you thought you’d never do, I am going to speak
briefly and then I think Representative Hardister is going to speak on
this bill. Senate Bill 337 is Senator Tillman’s bill and when it emerged
from the Senate, I would have been leading the charge against it. As it
set out a new board that would have taken the whole charter school issue
and made it independent of the state board of education creating a real
constitutional conundrum. But this doesn’t do that. There is...</p>

An intense negotiation. Representative Johnson being involved.
Representative Hardister, Representative Stam. A number of people. And
the end result of what this bill does is create an advisory board to the
state board on charter schools. It also has eliminated all of the
controversial provisions with regard to funding issues and admissions
issues. Now would write the bill exactly as it is? No. But on this issue
I don’t think other there’d be 120 bills if we all got to write it. And
so I disagree with the portion on licensure but the vast majority of
this bill simply creates a new mechanism and maybe an improved one to
handle the charter recommendation process which still is fundamentally
with the state board of education where I believe it constitutionally
must be. Because I believe it’s been negotiated in extraordinary good
faith by the Senators involved and the Representatives involved. Because
of the amendments . Representative Whitmire and Representative Hardister
and I and others offered that were accepted in the education committee
it is my view that good faith compromise work ought to receive
deference. And with that I will be supporting and voting the bill, for
the bill, encourage my colleagues to do so. And Mr. Speaker I hope that
you would recognize Representative Hardister. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hardister please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. In the
interest of time, I’m not going to say a lot other than my colleague
Representative Glazier did an excellent job of summarizing the bill. The
discussion that we had in the House education committee’s one of the
best discussions I’ve ever seen and heard. We did a great job working
with all the stake holders who were interested in the bill. It has
bipartisan support. And essentially what it does is again, my, my
seatmates acts like he’s gonna turn my light off. I think he’s ready to
drive back to the coast. Bye. But essentially what it does is it sets up
the charter school advisory board which has no rule making authority. It
simply provides advice and input to the state board of education. It
also will make certain changes to certain laws that pertain to the
operation of charter schools. I think it’s a great bill. I hope you’ll
support it. And I know we’re all ready to go home. So let’s vote for,
for this bill. Feel good about it and go home. Although I think we have
maybe one more on the calendar. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a simple amendment that I
believe is agreeable with Representative Hardister. It does one small
item. It basically inserts a provision that says in the event of a
dispute between the local school system and a charter school over the
calculation in transference of the pupil, per pupil shares, that as an
alternative to litigation they may use a process of mediation that’s
provided for in GS115C-230A. I ask the house to concur. [SPEAKER

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the House if your House
education committee may remember that I looked at this, as I looked at
this bill, I mean, I agree first of all with the advocates of the bill
that it is an extraordinarily improved bill over what came over from the
Senate. The Senate bill gave far too much authority to charter, to a
charter board. It was potentially in conflict with the state board of
education. But what we’ve done here in my judgment is elevate the
charter schools to position that appears almost equal to the state, to
the traditional public</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and representative Glazier. It is my pleasure to
tonight to bring before this body a very important bill and a ?? bill
that we worked together on honestly entire session with senate and house
democrats and republicans. It's the bill on human trafficking. For many
of you may have heard North Carolina ranks eight in the nation for the
worst in terms of human trafficking in the United States of America. And
the community in which I live is one of the worst cities in the state of
North Carolina for that issue. We set out to accomplish three things by
creating the first real comprehensive human trafficking and safe harbor
laws in North Carolina. The first was to recognize who the true victims
are. The ones who are being held against their will and are sold to
slavery. The second was to punish the perpetrators who are profiting
from the trade. And the third is to educate law enforcement and assist
them on their efforts to identify the real victims and help those
victims rehabilitate their lives. I appreciate everyone's effort on this

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, the discussion on the amendment, if not, the question before the
house is the passage of the amendment sent forth by representative
Glazier for the house committee substitute of Senate Bill 683. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will opt machine record the vote. One-hundred having voted in the
affirmative, none in the negative, the amendment passes. Representative
Glazier is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Very briefly, I’m not going to go
through the provisions as we did in sub-committee, but I will say this
was the work of Representative Conrad, Representative Richardson,
Representative… myself, it’s getting late, Representative Faircloth. And
I really do appreciate everyone’s work. The one thing I think you should
know - because it’s a far more reaching bill than just trafficking - it
totally rewrites the prostitution laws of North Carolina as well. And
so, since you may get asked this question because this is going to
affect thousands of potential criminal cases, you should know that the
way this was done, unanimously in the sub-committee and in the
committee, is to create four offenses. The offenses are of
prostitution…thank you Mr. Speaker… the offense of prostitution – and
the big change here is to recognize that most women who are forced into
prostitution are victims. They are not criminal defendants. And we ought
to stop treating them as defendants and start treating them as the
victims they are, having been forced, sometimes for survival, often for
survival, to engage in prostitution. And so, this bill specifically
creates a deferred prosecution capacity for those victims and allows
them to be treated that way and for minors under the age of 18, for 16
and 17 year olds, mandates that we treat them as victims.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to know if my colleague would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, is there any opposition to this bill at this
late day?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, I doubt that, but because I think this bill
engages some long, large provisions that people at least need some
explanation on, I’d like to take 2 more minutes to do that. This change
is as I suggested – and so for any minor who is stopped for
prostituting, they will now have deferred prosecution – which I must
commend Representative Stam on – and their only conditions are for us to
treat them and create non-secure custody situations for them and to do
something that we’ve never done in this state. But for those who solicit
prostitutes, for those who then are pimps, and for those who traffic,
those offenses now create substantially increased penalties including:
on second offenses and for offenses where they are prostituting or
attempting to solicit or patronize a minor or anyone who is mentally
retarded, very large prison time. There is an attempt to scale it up
with each step and each offense. And this creates a real, for the first
time, combination statute that gets it exactly what Representative Davis
and Representative Hamilton have tried to do, and want to do. You should
also know, that there are several other provisions of the bill. There is
a provision that creates investigative grand-juries for human
trafficking. There is a provision of the bill as well that creates a way
to have some additional prison space for these people. And that is also
Representative Stam’s provision. And I’ll be glad to answer any
questions, but this is a complete rewrite – done by the committee and by
the sponsors, and they should be commended – of the entire offense of
prostitution in this state and it is one of the best bills we will
probably pass this session. I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I was the
only Republican primary sponsor along with my Democratic fellow
representatives Hamilton, Mobley, Carney on House Bill 221 that was
entitled Safe Harbor/Victims of Human Trafficking. And all of the
provisions of House Bill 221 have been included in the bill before you
which is Senate Bill 683. I commend the bill to you and hope that you
will vote in favor of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the House committee
substitute, the Senate Bill 683, as amended on its second reading. All
in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I really do need to know this personally. I have now fully missed my
fundraiser which is fine but I would like to go home if we’re not going
to meet this evening so I can actually say, “Thank you,” to the host.
But I will stay if you need it for a quorum. My question is, “With the
lights going up and down, are we calling at midnight and are we going to
have a quorum?”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair was just about to clarify that Representative Glazier. In the
opinion of the Chair there were some 63 lights on indicating they were
going to come back, 64 including the Chair. The Chair also takes
Representative Boles’ point that there are some members off-site who
will most likely come back. So, the Chair assumes that we will have
quorum at 12:01 AM.
Members let’s just do this, before the members lay the chamber…

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, in the opinion of the Chair many
votes are changing. It is likely to result in a controversial bill. The
Chair has no intention of coming back and having a lengthy debate at
12:01 AM. Please give the message to Representative Glazier we will have
Session at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the House be at ease, all members who do not wish to speak please
turn their lights off. You will be recognized in turn. Representative
Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, earlier we took up a bill on human trafficking and having
Chaired Judiciary there was also a bill that Representative Schaffer and
Representative Presnell had sponsored on that same subject and they had
done a lot of work on that also to include witnesses before the
committee. So I think they should get some credit on that subject too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeill, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to change my vote to “No,” on 103 also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Noted.

Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, given the proliferation of the “No” votes that are
occurring right now, is there any assurance that we’re going to have 61
members present at 9:00 AM?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative Lucas, this is probably one of the oddest moments
in my time as Speaker, but the Chair had some 103 “Yes” votes before.
There have been about maybe 12 votes changed to “No.” So that overnight
or people not coming to Session tomorrow could change the outcome but
there are still a number of votes who would have to change before I
would necessarily presume…</p>

There could be, there could be a motion before we leave tonight to test
that ?? of the ??  members present still voting by simply doing a motion
to reconsider. And then if the motion to reconsider is done, and then
there's a vote taken up or down on the support of the vote or the bill
at this time and it were to fail then we could dispose of it tonight.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Speaker...
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Having voted on the prevailing side of the Senate Bill 103, I move that
that vote be reconsidered.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Members, if you intend to vote on this, please take your seat. Again,
members, just by way of explanation, what has occurred here is there's a
motion to reconsider the vote. The chair would anticipate that if you
take the motion to reconsider the vote, that we would go back to the
question and we would go back and test whether or not there is
sufficient support for the vote. Yet, the motion, if it fails, then, I
probably shouldn't say this, but it would literally render tomorrow
night or tomorrow morning's session invalid because we will have
disposed of the bill. Then at this time the question before the House is
the motion to reconsider the Senate Committee substitute for Senate Bill
103. All in favor of reconsidering the prior vote, vote aye. All opposed
vote no. The clerk will open a vote.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Speaker…
SPEAKER CHANGES
We're in the middle of the vote call. The clerk will lock the machine
and record the vote. 74 having voted affirmative and 14 in the negative,
the bill is back before us. Representative ?? please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Speaker, I know I'm tired and it's been a long day but I guess I
wanna just ask the question: are we trying to kill the bill? Is that the
intent? It's a Senate bill and I think that would be… It's not my bill.
I'm only carrying it for the Senate and I understand there are some
projects that are in the process of being implemented. I think that
would be a really poor thing to do and I'm gonna go ahead and say a
little bit further. As we're sitting here trying to negotiate the budget
with the Senate, as we are sitting here trying to do tax reform with the
Senate. And then on an initial vote of 106 to 3, and just for what
reason that we choose not to stay here tonight and accommodate a Senator
who is just trying to do the right thing. I'm not gonna call any names,
but I'm gonna tell you. Last Monday night, for no reason whatsoever,
this bill was removed from the calendar. And it was a game that was
being played on another issue that had nothing to do with this bill,
this Senator or anything else. It was being used as fodder to get
something else. It got called up in there and since Monday night I have
been asking to please get the bill back on the calendar. And we finally
got it on today. It's not my fault. It's not the Senator's fault. And I
just... If it's more important to you to go home tonight, then we'll
just bring it back. I gonna ask you not to kill it. That's not a cute
thing to do. It's not a… it's not an honorable thing to do. But if you
wanna just let it lay, then we'll vote on it again after  you go home
and have your time off. That's okay. It's just gonna cost a lot of extra
money to a lot of extra people that had no part in this game that was
being played for no reason. So Mr. Speaker, with that I would just
request that you let the bill lay until the 8th day of June...</p>
