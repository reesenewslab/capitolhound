<p id="00:00">
Good morning. It being a little after twelve, and a quorum being
present, the House committee on Transportation will come to order. We
are served with pages today, Lily Gupton from Franklin, Haley Hillison
from Wake, Cammy Holland from Guilford, Hannah Landy from Wake, Anna
Marujo from Guilford, and Griffin Matsuo from Wake. Our
Sergeants-at-arms today are Bill Bass, Joe Crook, Warren Hawkins, and
Jesse Hayes, Brenda Carter and Giles Perry are our staff, and Lynn
Taylor and Carla Farmer are committee clerks.
First the chair would like to add a bill to today's agenda, if there's
no objection, this is Represe- Would the committee come to order,
please? This would be Senate bill 8-64 is a local bill on the use of
ATVs on the roads in Yancyville, Sen. Woodard is the primary sponsor,
and it's fairly noncontroversial but we are getting copies prepared. If
there's no objection, we will add that. Hearing none, first bill will be
HB 1097, Rep. Iler will present for Rep. Torbett. Rep. Iler moves that
PCS to House bill 1097 be before the committee, all in favor say
&quot;aye&quot;?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed? The PCS Is now properly before the committee. Rep. Iler, you
have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm substituting for Rep. Torbett, who let me
know recently that I would be presenting these two bills. They don't
seem highly controversial, they're bills that, provisions that DMV asked
for and 1097 allows the divison to serve hearing orders in dealer and
salesman hearings in a variety of ways instead of by rule 4 of the NC
rules of civil procedure. Licences, theft - let me get to my bill - it
authorizes the DMV to place a licence issued on a motor vehicle, dealers
and manufacturer's licence of law on probation, and it is as probation
to the different fines and so forth they can do. In other words they can
deny, suspend, place on probation, or revoke a license issued under this
article if any of the following reasons. And it lists the reasons in the
bill there: a dealer or salesman can be suspended or placed on
probation. It just adds the probation to the list of penalties that can
be invoked in this case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other questions for the bill's sponsor for the staff? Rep. Reives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. And in completely in support of the bill, think
it's a wonderful bill, only question I had, and maybe for staff, is on
section 1, number 10, when you say &quot;submitting a bad check&quot; is
that gonna be a worthless check as defined in criminal statutes, or bad
check as we traditionally talk, just a check that is not supported by
funds. I'm just trying to figure out who the burden's going to be on for
that one to prove.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe this is existing statute, but does staff have an answer for
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you Mr. Chairman. That is existing law as one of the
standards for which the Division of Motor Vehicles can use to suspend or
take action on license. It does not require a conviction, the current
law doesn't require a conviction it just says &quot;submitting a bad
check to the Division of Motor Vehicles.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, and that is-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No follow up, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? Rep. Iler moves that the adoption of
House bill 1097 proposed committee substitute unfavorable to the
original bill, this will be reported to the floors. So many as favor the
motion say &quot;aye&quot;?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, &quot;no&quot;? Motion carries, the bill is adopted. Second
bill is HB 1157, electronic drivers license ammendment, Rep. Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This bill is expressing a surge in drivers
license renewals due to extension of renewal process

… five years to eight years, which passed in 2007. In the coming years
they expect a surge – 1.4 million additional renewals next year, 1.2 the
following year. In order to meet the demand and provide quality customer
service, the division is seeking the authority to offer renewals online.
Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia and others offer this service. Commissioner
Thomas has taken an aggressive agenda to become customer-friendly, and
this is a step in that direction. So this just adds online renewal in
the future to the existing methods by which you may renew your license.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to ask the bill sponsor… just had a
question for clarification about the photo portion of it. If you don’t
go in and have another picture taken, you just… like am I going to be
able to look 60 the rest of my life if I keep doing it this way, or
what? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s a good question. I don’t think anybody’s
here from the department, the DMV who can answer that, but I would
suspect that you would look 60 for a long time based on this. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Please state your name and your title, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I’m Kelly Thomas, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. By
federal statute, your photo ID is good for 16 years, and that’s how we
would… Whatever your photo was on your last in-person renewal, that
would be the photo you used on your online renewal. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And if I may ask Mr. Thomas a question… [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman’s recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I assume that if a person has
a concern they don’t look like their license, they may come in and get a
replacement photo? Is that possible? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Kelly
Thomas again. We have a lot of customers that want to redo their photo,
even though they may have the opportunity to do it online. In that case
they may come into the office, we’d take a new photo and they would get
a new driver’s license. Of course if they did it in person, that right
now is an eight year renewal period, and there will be a new license
available as of December this year. It’s called the Next Generation
Secure Driver’s License. It will be an upgrade from the PVC license
you’re carrying in your pocket today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other
questions for the Commissioner? Representative Stone’s recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Obviously this has worked in our
surrounding states and we’ve been able to move with the new technology.
I do have concerns with the fraud. With now it’s on email or internet as
well, there’s a potential for a lot of fraud or abuse or stolen IDs, and
I guess my question is what are surrounding states doing, or how do they
find a way to handle that situation, and are we prepared to do the same?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Again, Kelly Thomas. A good question. Much
like you do banking online today, the secure mode by which you commit or
take a transaction online would be the same that you would do to apply
for your driver’s license. Today online capabilities, we can renew your
vehicle registration online. The next step of this to do identification
online, you would have one more added step, a pin number for example,
that would be only assigned to you and authorized for you to change out
addresses and update your date online. All PCI-compliant.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up? Further discussion? Representative Wilkins, I
apologize, and then… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, and this
may be for staff. For some reason, every bit of this language seems
very, very familiar to me. Could someone tell me if a couple years ago
we had a larger, more inclusive bill that included some of this very
same language? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Perry. Excuse me, Ms. Carter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s a similar provision in place now for people
who are in the military, either active or reserved, or for residents of
the state who reside outside the state, so there are some instances
where people can already renew. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good catch, Winkie. Representative Ford. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For the bill sponsor, maybe staff,
does this affect our photo voter ID bill in anyway? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well for my part, I don’t see how it would, but staff, answer that also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I don’t believe it has any effect on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? The motion before
the committee is the approval…</p>

... a favorable report for House Bill 1157, reporting to the floor. So
many as favor the motion say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Opposed, no. Motion carries. House Bill 1190, DPS Study
Commercial Vehicle Safety. Representative Dixon’s recognized to present
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair and members of the
committee. This bill does exactly what the title says. This came out of
the agriculture and forestry study group. We believe that there are
additional advantages that we can take from participating in the
Commercial Vehicle Safely Alliance of North America. The department and
patrol stand ready to help us analyze what we’re doing at this time and
suggest ways that we can improve it, both for the betterment of our
commercial operators as well as for public safety. I’d be willing to ask
to entertain any questions. There is no opposition; this is a good bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? Representative
Brown’s recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion when appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s appropriate, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move House
Bill 1190 favorable. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s it, with referral to the
floor. The motion before the committee is the favorable approval of
House Bill 1190, referred to the floor. So many as favor the motion say
aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The bill
carries. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The addition to our committee agenda today
is Senate Bill 864, Yanceyville ATV. Senator Woodard, welcome to the
House, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well it’s nice to
come over to the chamber that does some work once in a while, so since
ours is… well never mind. Thank you Mr. Chairman for hearing me at the
last moment here on this bill. Fairly straightforward local bill. As you
can see from the text, a number of local governments have exemptions to
be able to drive their ATVs within their corporate limits to take care
of city maintenance, and the town of Yanceyville simple requested to be
added to that list of exemptions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions for
the bill sponsor? Representative Jeter, is that a motion? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] As long as it doesn’t involve mopeds, I have a motion when
ready. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it’s appropriate, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I move for a favorable report to Senate Bill 864 with I believe
a referral to the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct, sir. The
motion before the committee is favorable approval, Senate Bill 864 with
a referral to the floor. So many as favor the motion say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. Motion carries. That is the
end of our agenda and we are adjourned.</p>
