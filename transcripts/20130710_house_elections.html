<p id="00:00">
As our house pages today, so you guys look a lot younger today. Members,
you have the agenda before you. We’re going to bounce around a little
bit to try to accommodate folks’ schedules. The first bill that we’re
going to take up today is Senate Bill 406, short title’s repeal laws
denied Section 5 preclearance. I do not believe there is a PCS to this
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is? Representative Cotham moves the PCS be before us. Without
objection, it is.  Senator Brunstetter you’re recognized to explain your
bill sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Members, this is a piece of clean up legislation.
 The bill applies to any city or county ordinance, resolution, act,
policy, public or local law that was enacted by the General Assembly for
which the U.S. Department of Justice filed an objection under the Voting
Rights Act and did not withdraw their objection prior to June 25, 2013.
Which was the date of the spring court decision.  Basically what this
bill does is it clears off of our books a number of statutes and local
acts that have never received pre-clearance so it avoids any possibility
that they can spring onto our books in case there’s a change there. The
Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 4
was the formula used as a basis for determining which jurisdictions were
subject to Section 5 pre-clearance. There is no impact from this bill on
the current ?? litigation.  The bill does not include situations where
the U.S. District Court issued a declaratory judgment that such
ordinance did not violate the Voting Rights Act, it’s just a piece of
clean up legislation.  I ask for your support please
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or further debate on the bill if not is there a
motion or question, Representative Michaux?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to state his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know I’m going to have a question. Although Section 4 was stricken
by the U.S. Supreme Court, why are you, I don’t understand why anything
was not been cleared under Section 5, why you using Section 5, I don’t
understand that at all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux?  I think actually first of all, the list of
these things are things that, some of them date back to 40 some odd
years ago and are a series of, sometimes it’s a local district,
sometimes it’s annexations. Anything that required preclearance and it’s
just sitting on the books.  And it is true that when we first filed the
bill, the question was whether Section 5 was going to get repealed
altogether.  I think regardless if whether Section 5 was repealed or
Section 4’s impact on Section 5, there’s no reason to have 40 years of
these old laws on the books.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So let me understand a little bit further. What you’re doing is those
instances where you had a law on the books that was not pre-cleared, I’m
understand what you’re doing is you are taking off the books. You are
not invalidating anything that was not pre-cleared under Section 5 that
went into effect.  Am I hearing that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the law went into effect because it received its pre-clearance or
however that would work, this does not impact that. This effects laws
that have never actually been enacted because they ran into preclearance
issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One other question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s the same thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentlemen wish to ?? another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. So what is the bottom line effect of what you’re doing here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bottom line is it takes probably about 8 pages of laws that have
been enacted over the General Assembly over the last 40 some years off
the books completely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, that’s my problem. You said it takes about 8 pages of laws
off the books that have been enacted previously on it. That’s what’s
bothering me. What these laws are that are being taken off the book?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can give you a few examples, I’d be happy to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized to do that sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m just reading straight off the list. The list is kept by the
Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice.  There was a literacy
test for voter registration dated March 18, 1971.  There are laws
relating to State and Senate house districts dated July 30, 1971.There
is an issue related to districts in the Lumberton city school district
from 1975 and the list just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.  Because I want this to be, for instance, the first one you
mentioned, the literacy test thing. There’s a bill in it here now to
remove that from the Constitution. That’s a Constitutional thing, even
though it’s not effective, it’s still in the Constitution.  This does
not pull this out of the Constitution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding is that this law was never enacted, it never received
pre-clearance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it’s still a part of.</p>

our constitution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I defer to you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I can show it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sure you can, I’ve seen your constitution before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not mine, ours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state additional questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m just concerned that there were some laws that were not precleared
that actually stayed and kept other laws in effect that those laws would
have cleared up. I’m just having a problem with that, Mr. Chairman. I
know that there’s a majority here that’s going to take of this situation
anyway, but I just want to voice my objection to it at this juncture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My guess is, and I’d be happy to provide you with my copy of the list
when we’re done, I would imagine that you would not want to be in a
position of supporting keeping these laws on the books after you take a
look at this list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are some that I may want to stay on there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll be interested to hear that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate from the committee. Representative
Fisher, you’re recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question, and maybe it would be
appropriate to ask of staff or the bill’s sponsor, either one. I am not
an attorney, I don’t play one on TV, but I would like to know if we pass
this bill, what other...because of the Supreme Court decision, what sort
of retroactive kind of effect will this have on bills that we already
passed that were subject to preclearance? Now that the Supreme Court has
done its business, what, and this is to either staff or the sponsor,
what laws could this affect that have already been passed based on
pre-clearance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I think what you’re question is outside the scope of what
this bill does so I’d be happy to defer to staff. I haven’t read the
whole decision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of you all want to take a stab at it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For any bill that had already been denied preclearance, the decision
does not directly address that, but as this bill would do with clean up,
it would clarify it so there would be no lingering questions as to
whether those bills would be revived. The US Department of Justice has
posted on their website a notice on section five provisions and what
they have said is, with respect to submissions under section five
pending as of June 25th or received after that date, they are informing
people that the coverage formula has been struck down and accordingly,
no determination will be made under section five by the attorney general
on the specified change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a quick follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized for a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Supreme Court decision doesn’t have any
effect on those laws that were already passed that were subject
preclearance under section five. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the face of the decision, it would not appear to deal with anything
that had already been denied preclearance. This bill would resolve any
lingering questions and would prevent litigation on that point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate?  The Chair will accept a motion. The
gentleman from Stanly has a motion as I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I move that we give the proposed Committee
House Substitute to Senate Bill 406 favorable report. Unfavorable as to
original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve heard the motion. All in favor of the motion please signify by
saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those opposed, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ayes have it and the bill is given a favorable report. Thank you,
Senator Brunstetter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The next bill on our calendar is going to be House Bill 436,
Gubernatorial Team Ticket. Is this a PCS? There is a PCS. The PCS is
before and unless I hear an objection. Hearing no objection the PCS is
before the committee. Representative Jones you are recognized to explain
your bill, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, House Bill 436 is
entitled Gubernatorial Team Ticket. Basically it would provide and the
proposed Committee Substitute is for a study for the Joint Legislative
Elective Oversight Committee. The bill would provide for a
constitutional amendment on the November 2014 ballot. It would amend the
constitution to require the Governor and the Lt. Governor to run as a
team in the fall election. I would tell you that in the 43 states that
elect a Lt. Governor, 26 of them have the Governor and Lt. Governor run
as a team. I’m not suggesting we should do it because the majority of
states do, but the reason I believe the majority of states do is the
same reason that the President and the Vice President of the United
States run together as a time. Quite honestly, the proponents of this
bill do not believe that it’s a healthy situation...</p>

?? that the governor and lieutenant governor be of opposite parties.
Now, I will further stay that of the states that do this there is two
different ways basically.  The way that our Bill had proposed and that
we would take to the study since this is now a proposed study would
actually have the citizens of North Carolina continue to elect the
Lieutenant Governor in the primary who would then join the Governor on
the file ticket.  There are other states that allow the Governor to
choose his running mate, if you will.  I guess that's something we can
talk about in the study.  We felt like that it would be appropriate
since the citizens of North Carolina already chose the candidate for
Lieutenant Governor for them to continue to do that.  I will stop at
that point.  I am happy to defer to any questions.  I will tell you that
both the Governor and Lieutenant Governor told me that they support
this.  The Bill and the way that it's written would not come into effect
until the 2020 election so it wouldn't effect the current office holders
anyway as it is now; but  again, the PCS has a study for this and Mr.
Chairman I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Fisher do you have a question to the
bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You may state your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I have a question and I may
have a follow up as well.  How is this stated in the Constitution?  So,
if I know this is going to be a constitutional amendment, a vote, it's
going to be put to a vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  It's actually just a study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  A study, gotcha.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  It's just a study now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Then let me ask my follow up.  I heard you refer to
the idea that a situation where we have a republican governor and a
democratic lieutenant governor might be unhealthy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Or visa-verse.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Or visa-verse and I guess I think back to the Hunt
Hulshizer's days and wonder if you have had input from folks who thought
that that was a particularly unhealthy situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I think you're probably talking about when
Lieutenant Governor Gardner was elected and was a republican under Hunt.
 Is that correct?  Hunt Hulshizer, okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I would just suggest that I have not talked, of
course, Governor Hulshizer is recently deceased, I have not talked with
Governor Hunt.  People that believe this is a good deal simply believe
that the person who is next in line to the Governor's Mansion should the
Governor not be able to perform his duties should be of the same party,
similar to the Vice-President of the United States.  We think that's a
good policy.  I don't really necessarily want to go back to the example
that we had in history where we had a republican lieutenant governor
under a democrat governor but I think the politics that occurred in that
situation were not good, and I think it would just be better if we had
the lieutenant governor be the same party as the governor, and I think
most people understand that reasoning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Further discussion on the Bill.  Representative
Michaux is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. Chairman I understand the Bill has been really
cut back from its original purpose and this is just a study commission
and I don't have problems with a study commission because I know how far
they go sometimes.  So, if you want to motion for it, I make the motion
that we give it a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative ?? do you have a question of the
Bill's process sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I actually do.  I'm just curious.  I think the
original Bill was  good Bill and I'm curious why we would change it to a
study Bill, especially since we know that the lower chamber is not
inclined to pass study Bills?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  That would be a question for the Bill sponsor.  I
believe that was probably a consensus of house leadership and quite
honestly it's not an urgent Bill that has to be passed before we leave
here this session.  We are in July and it is something we can take up as
a study and look at when we come back into session next year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Michaux is recognized for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I move that the proposed Committee Substitute for
House Bill 436 be given a favorable report.  The original one an
unfavorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You've heard the motion. All in favor please signify
by saying aye.  Opposed no.  The ayes have it.  The Bill is given a
favorable report.  While you're there, why don't we go ahead and get
House Bill 607 a required use of paper box.  This is also a PCS if you
want to send forth a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  ??  we have the original Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Members by the way of explanation House Bill 607
imagine that you are considering the committee has taken up to this
point.</p>

paper ballot. Again, there are many studies about this. You don't have
to go very far on the internet to see that there are groups all over the
spectrum  that believe that this is the case. I will get to what I think
is the most controversial part of it, and that is some cost. We do have
36 counties in this state that use DRE machines. Direct, recording,
electronic touch screen systems. I am sympathetic to the idea that it
costs some money to replace those machines. The physical note says that
there would be a projected cost if you included replacing the machines,
providing additional machines for people that are disabled and not able
to do a hand ?? ballot, if you will, plus the cost of the ballots
themselves. It probably would approach 11 million dollars. Perhaps this
group may decide that we need to take this and do it as a study. If we
do, I would hope that we would at the very least provide for moratorium
on buying new DRE machines. By the way, these DRE machines are illegal
in several states. I looked at a map online just a little while ago,
trying to determine how many, and I believe there are about 19 states
that do require paper ballots. What we're talking about here is not
something unusual at all. I would simply suggest, that if we are serious
about voter integrity, that there are many people that feel like this is
probably one of the most important issues we can deal with. I do believe
that it would be very possible for machines to be manipulated. I've had
conversations with some of our representatives, and they say &quot;we
trust our people at the board of elections, they're good people&quot; it
has nothing to do with that. We are talking about the integrity of the
machine being used itself. We're not talking about the people operating
the machines or putting them out there, let's make that very clear.
We're not impugning anybody, or anybody's character or anything like
that. We're simply saying that if the machine is doing the work,
machines can be manipulated, and the technology exists and I believe the
will is out there for someone to try to change the results of an
election by using that way. Again, I'm open to answer any questions you
may have. Again, there is a PCS we could consider that would put this in
a study, and quite frankly I'm fine with that, as long as that includes
a moratorium on buying new machines. Because, part of what the bill
itself would be intending to do, would be to replace the machines, at
least over time. Maybe we don't get it done for the 2014 election, maybe
it's 2016. We do need to be sensitive to the cost, we need to understand
that somehow we need to pay for this. I will also like to say that ??
are available and can be used for this purpose, and that is part of the
physical note we have. So that would be one way to certainly help to
fund that. With that Mr. Chairman, I'll defer to any questions that you
or the committee might have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? You have a question for the bill and sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a couple questions and comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized for your questions and comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The type of ballots you're referring to, that would be the scantron
machines, that are scanned by machines?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The most common one that I'm most familiar with, and the one that we use
in my county for instance.
We mark a paper ballot, we fill in next to the persons name, and there's
a machine that counts that ballot, but you have an actual paper ballot
that you mark, and the majority of the counties in the state use that
kind of system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. On the touch screens, which we are very familiar with in my
county. If you touch the wrong one by mistake, it has a big check mark.
It prompts you to &quot;oops you did the wrong one, you better punch the
other one&quot; and the other check mark goes away.
What do you do if you, when you fill in a bubble, what do you do if mark
the wrong one there, how do you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You take it back and get another ballot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And if you don't realize it, and you haven't been prompted by the paper
ballot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can't take away the operator error. If I go in to vote, and I make a
mistake and I mark the wrong person and turn it in, that's my fault.
We're trying to take away the fault of the machine. We can't change me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For comment, Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized for debate, Representative ??

[Speaker Change]
Board of Elections, who’s been on the Board of Elections for fifteen
years, twenty years. But will be the Chairman as of next Tuesday.  And
our Republican County Chairman. And both of them think this is a
terrible idea. We’ve been used to our touch screens. It has problems
with peoples fingernails going over the line and it’s because they were
prompted to make a correction by the machine, if they’re paying
attention. [??] paper roll that is double checked at random on that
machine and you can look down and see who you voted for on the last race
there. My wife worked in the scantronic era in the nineties, early
nineties, at the poll and it took two or three extra hours. That took
her time because they had to do, scan everything all over again. Maybe
that’s the exception but they had to scan everything all over again. It
two, three extra hours and I was sitting there waiting for her from
about eight thirty to about eleven thirty. And they actually
incorporated me to help. I wasn’t even sworn in. That’s another issue. I
think when e are retraining poll workers, we’ll be losing poll workers.
I mean it’s enough hours now. From six thirty to seven thirty. Thirteen,
fourteen hour day. I’m all for a lot of your other Bills. I’m not for
this Bill. And Representative Jones, if you would consider the study, or
at very least, grandfather in those counties that are using these
machines, grandfather them in for some time period to give them a
chance. We’ll be spending a million dollars, by the way, by the estimate
of the Board of Elections soon to be Chair.  Bout a half a million
dollars in my average size County of twenty seven Precincts. So if you
consider grandfathering our counties in, it would be easier to vote for
this. At this point, unless it’s a study, I certainly couldn’t, can’t
support it. I’m sorry.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman, if I could respond.
[Speaker Change]
You may.
[Speaker Change]
Kay. First of all, I will ask that we’ll consider the PCS. It will be
amended however that it will provide for a moratorium in buying new DRE
machines. Any machines bought at this point would require an electronic
ballot while we’re doing that study.
[Speaker Change]
Does the gentleman wish to move that the PCS be before the committee now
instead of the original Bill?
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir, I move [??] PCS.
[Speaker Change]
Is there an objection for the PCS being before the committee? An
objection was made. All in favor of the motion to bring the PCS forward
the committee please signify by saying aye. All opposed no. The ayes
have it. The PCS is properly before the committee. Gentleman may
continue his explanation on the PCS.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, if I could continue, you know, this is the
Elections Committee. I think, quite honestly, it’s our job to determine
whether this is good policy. I am concerned about the cost. I think that
ultimately decide if this is good policy, how we best fund it. And
perhaps it goes to Finance for Administration, or Appropriations or
both. But I will say this; I think we have to work with folks to make
sure that we’re not placing a substantial burden on our counties.
However, I think ultimately, what this committee needs to decide and
what the House and the Senate will need to decide if it goes this far. I
mean what is the true price of free, fair, reliable, accurate, and
transparent elections in our State? I mean that’s the bottom line. Is
this a good policy? If this is a good policy, I believe we’ll find a way
to adequately fund it and quite honestly the dollars we’re talking
about, in the context of the State budget is pretty small. I do believe
that it is a policy worth pursuing. Obviously we just put it into a
study so we don’t have to spend a lot of time today. But I would ask for
your support for the PCS as it will be amended.
[Speaker Change]
The, just by way of explanation, PCS is before us. I think staff is
working on an amendment and you may want to take a look at that before
sending it forth. I had several hands raised. Are there, these are the
hands I had raised, I’m going in the order I saw them and if any of you
want to come off now that it’s a study Bill let me know. I had [??],
Fisher, Conrad, Avila, Michaux, and Floyd. In that order. Okay. And
Graham on there also. Anybody else want to come off? Alright,
Representative [??], you are recognized. Do you have a question for the
Bill’s [??] or wish to debate the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
I wanted to debate the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
I’d like to, I’d like to say that I don’t, I don’t need to see the
studies and, and, and everything else. And I don’t think we need to do a
study. What we need to do is act on this. I can tell you from my own
experience, for the last three Presidential elections, when I went in to
vote, I would hit my choice of President several times before, and it
would show up the opponent’s name, it would be lighted up. And I’m not
an idiot. I’m good on computers.</p>

<p id="30:00">
I know I hit the spot where it's supposed to  be  two or three times and
then I would call the election workers over and they would mess with it,
it would do the same thing so they have to shut that machine down we
have to go to another machine.  At some point electronic voting's gonna
be the way to go.  But right at this juncture in North Carolina we don't
have a system that's completely reliable.  There have been many
complaints that's because I have been involved just like many of you
have and I have had many, many, many complaints on these machines doing
the same thing.  I think we do need to go to a paper ballot and when I
did find to go to another machines and cast my vote and it appeared to
work right.  There was nothing that they could show me in my hand that
tells me which way my votes were cast.  I felt uncomfortable, I know
that they have got it on the little  roll in the machine and you can see
your last one or two votes on there but there is nothing   that they can
give you to show you all of your votes and which way they were cast.
And I think the smart thing for us to do because that's why we were send
up here is to make these decisions  you and I and most everybody sit in
this   room knows that this Study Bills not going to the Senate.  They
are not gonna approve it, they don't like Study Bills and that's just
the way it has been this session.  I would like to recommend that that
we do not, that that we give a fair, uh, unfavourable to this PCS and we
support the  original bill and do paper ballots until if and when the
state comes up with equipment that's reliable enough to record our votes
accurately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Conrage you recognize to debate bill or ask question the
bill first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
While I'm happy to support the promotes committee substitute, I was also
concerned about the cause my County had did contacted me that would be a
better half a million dollars.  After the hanging chair problem in
Florida, that most county did invest all types of equipment and I don't
disagree with you at all the optical scan is, is the best equipment and
we purchased that for the election day  what has  caused the
complications in the type of equipment used is only though they uh,  we
have a 101 ? and that's multiple different combinations of ballots and
an early  loading we felt the electronic was the  best  way to pull up
the appropriate ballot for the vast mix of people that should come in
and the door and I don't sure if they and the one that has an individual
ballot. But that has been  part of complication and I do support your
moratorium, because this equipment is expensive and we  don't want
another Boards or Commissioners going out  there and adding to our
buying some type of equipment that our Committee will decide, it's not
gonna be appropriate.  So, I do think we need a factor and either both
the, the fact that you do have to have the curbs of voting and the type
of equipment that is required for that as well as the complications of
early voting and what we might be doing in regards to early voting, you
know, it's excessively long  and in my opinion and those are some other
factors that I think are contributing to the accuracy, the election
statement far beyond the actual equipment choice and hopefully some of
those other factors are being the future as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avley, you recognize to debate the bill order or to ask a
question on the bills sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I have a question but it is actually
representative Oiler,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the Gentlemen, now I ? you to use
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, representative of oiler, Here in our county we do use the
scantronic where as the paper ballot to scan through, when you use the
type of machine that  use how do you handle a recount
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are  types that are produced as a paper trial so type in the
machine you can see as you vote and then it is capped and actually there
is a random our hand count done before campus that inputs timus?  as 10
days later where the Counts provisions them all there and so that's how
you do recount as you go back to the each individual low for the optical
rays for two rolls or whatever it is
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may, you may state to follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you above count every one of the votes that were cast, do you run it
through the machine or do you take a statistical analysis of who  how
people voted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay for a recount you, they go back through every roll in the arrays
that was produced and tying to the total vote count. They as far as the
thank you for some other kinda  account. What was that, there is a
random hand account as a check before the campus.  If there is a recount
they have to go through every single vote on the roll
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, that's, that was  bump clarification,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When you have to do a recount you take the tape out and somebody sits
there and just like we do here in ? where the paper ballot  and we have
a paper ballot and we say so and so know,</p>

<p id="35:00">
so-and-so, yes. ?? you do that for every vote that was cast on that
tape.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, one person eye-balls the tape and announces it
and the other one checks it off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, you are recognized to debate
the bill, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Chairman. I'm glad we got rid of that other
bill. I want to make sure that on the amendment to this bill that when
you talk about putting a moratorium on the ??printer machine that you're
not putting a moratorium on the printers of office scan machines, other
machines to scan ballots.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They're making some changes right back here, now.
That's why I called both of these gentlemen up, to try to help with the
state ??board to make sure, they're going to try to come up- the
amendment's not before us, so we want to make sure that the amendment
language-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That was what my concern was, was that, to be sure you
put in there that you're not talking about the Opti-scan machines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did y'all hear that? You're talking about the DRE?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. If you're talking about just the DREs and not
the Opti-scan machines, I don't have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, I've got some votes in front of
you, but I'll go ahead and take you if it's on this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask if we could displace this while they work on it
and get to Senate Bill 317.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, we can probably do that. Are there any- Let me
ask you this. Are there any members who desire comment at this time
about the bill before getting to the amendment? I had several folks
who--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. So you're all fine. As a matter of fact, I'll go
ahead and ask. I have Floyd, Graham, Cunningham, Iler again, and then
Ford. Do you members still wish to comment on the bill when we come back
to it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [multiple speakers]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. We'll do this, we'll displace it temporarily.
Representative Jones, if you want to work on that. Our other bill is
Senate Bill 317. There is a PCS for Senate Bill 317 that the gentleman
from Guilford, Representative Blust, moves before us. All in favor of
the PCS being before us, please signify by saying aye. Opposed no. The
ayes have it. The bill is before us. Senator Wade, you're recognized to
explain your bill, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm really not that familiar
with the PCS, so if it's okay with the Chair, we'll let Representative
Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hardister, you're recognized to explain
the bill, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth, are you going to weigh-in,
also? OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Senate Bill 317, basically redistricts and reforms the Guilford County
Board of Education. The bill has come over from the Senate. We've
prepared a PCS for the House. Representative Faircloth and I have
primarily been the two Representatives who have worked on this PCS.
Essentially what it does, if you look at the bill summary before you,
and I can see that you have the maps in front of you, this would reduce
the Guilford County Board of Education from 11 members to 9, and it
would match the maps with the Board of Commissioners. You may recall
that in 2011, the General Assembly redistricted the Guilford County
Board of Commissioners, and we reduced the Board from 11 members to 9,
eliminated 1 district and 1 at-large. Currently the Guilford County
Board of Commissioners has 8 districts and 1 at-large position. This
would match those districts. And what I believe that would do is it
would make government more efficient, because if you're a citizen of
Guilford County, the person who represents you on the Board of
Commissioners and the person who represents you on the Board of
Education would represent the same area. So it would make it easier for
the citizens to communicate with their elected officials, make it easier
for the two governing bodies to communicate. There's two other notable
provisions of the bill. One is that the terms would be 4 years. The
original Senate Bill 317 would reduce the term to 2 years, but we would
keep them at 4, match them and stagger them in accordance with the
County Commissioners. You'll see if you look at the bill, and staff can
explain this better than I can, but I believe in the 2014 elections all
the members would run on 2 year terms to reset it and then go back to 4
years after that. The third element is partisan elections. The PCS
before you would put partisan elections to the voters as a referendum,
so the voters of Guilford County could decide whether or not they want
their Board of Education to be partisan. With that, I'll be glad to take
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any questions for the bill sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, please state your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Your delegation in full support of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir. My understanding is that the three- we have
six members of our delegation. The three Republican Representatives,
which is myself, Representative Blust and Faircloth, support it.</p>

<p id="40:00">
The three democratic members, Representatives Adams, Brandon and
Harrison I believe are in opposition to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Alright. Representative Faircloth, you are recognized
to comment on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We probably should ask
Representative Harrison, and anyone else here of those three to speak
for their selves and not…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The chair intends to call Representative Harrison in
just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I would point out that we want to thank Senator Wade
for sending this bill over there, ?? and disagreements of how we get to
a different system with a school board. We do have some members from
back home. Mr. Chairman, might want to say a word about the appreciation
of having you be here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: We’ll do that. And I’m noticing the time. Let’s do
this.  Let’s go ahead and take comment from the members of the public
hearing and Representative Harrison, I’ll come back after. Do we have
any members of the public who would like to speak? If so, just simply
approach the mic, introduce yourself, where you’re from, who you’re
representing, and any comments you’d like to make about this particular
legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My
name is Rebecca Buffington, a member of the Guilford County Board of
Education, new member to the board, and I appreciate the opportunity to
speak today. We thank our representative Faircloth, and Harrison,
Hardister, for their taking a look at this bill and trying to provide
amendments to it that would make it a little easier for the ?? to
accept.  But the school board maintains its opposition to this bill in
the first place. Mostly, moving this board to a partisan board, we feel
very strongly about this. Many of you in here are educators, or have
affected the life of a child, and have made decisions about children. I
share the political affiliation with most of you that are in this room,
and I’ve been asked to make a lot of difficult decisions that affect
73,000 students in Guildford county. And have asked myself on a number
of occasions if I was concerned about my political affiliation rather
than making a child centered decision, if my vote would be different.
And in most cases, I believe it would be.  I don’t believe there’s any
room for politics when we’re making child centered decisions. I
appreciate the effort to keep this at a four year term. I want to point
out that school years don’t follow election terms. A two year term would
mean that school board members would only be there for one school year.
I think many of you would agree that if your election cycle caused you
to be here in session for one term, it would make you ineffective. I
agree with matching districts with county commissioners. I agree with
that because we have a very good working relationship with our county
commissioners. We’re actually very proud of that in Guilford County. And
we don’t really argue with moving from eleven members to nine members,
but we do ask you to carefully, carefully consider making a school board
partisan. Senator Wade has shared with us that she brought this bill
because she was feeling pressure from the residents of Guilford County
to do this.  But I would point out that the night before, a legislative
breakfast with Guilford county delegations school board, she introduced
this legislation, caught the entire delegation off guard. And I point
that out because if the citizens of Guilford County were demanding this,
it shouldn’t have caught her colleagues off guard. We have got a stream
of editorials in both the Greensboro and High Point Paper. There have
been a steady stream of letters to the editor. There’s been a steady
stream of email of citizens demanding that the one point of this bill
that their school board not be moved to a partisan school board. I
believe the High Point Enterprise did an opinion poll. Nearly 89% of the
community said that this should be a referendum, that they should be
able to weigh in, that they didn’t want their school board to be
partisan. So I would ask you to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Ma’am, I’m going to have to let the members comment.
Representative Harrison, you are recognized to briefly speak on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chair and thank you, Representative
Hardister and Faircloth for toning down what was really a very
problematic senate bill. But I’m still opposed. I’ve heard no favorable
comments from constituents in favor of this bill, and it will only hurt
opposition.</p>

...and we've got a unanimous opposition from our school board. I think
this is another example of unnecessary meddling in local government
affairs, and for purposes which I think is quite shameful. I think what
we did to the board of commissioners last session was unconscionable,
and this is just following in the footsteps of that. I think it is a
terrible bill. I hope you'll vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr, recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Chairman. I move that we give the proposed committee
substitute senate bill 317 a favorable report, unfavorable as to the

need to go ahead and adjourn. We will re-notice you as far as house bill
436. Representative Jones, I don't know if you want to try to do this
today, or some other day? We'll talk on the four. For now, we stand
adjourned.</p>
