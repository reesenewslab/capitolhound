The house will come to order, members will please take your seats,
visitors will retire from the chamber. The sargent of arms will close
the doors, members and guests in the galley are asked to please silence
all cellular phones. Prayer this morning will be offered by
representative Ruth Samulson. Members and visitors in the galley are
asked to stand for the prayer and also to remain standing for the pledge
of allegiance, which will be immediately following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members I was originally scheduled to give the prayer on July 2, which
happened to be my second son, David's, birthday and he had served here
once as an intern, and so I told him as part of my birthday present to
him. I was going to do the prayer in his honor and do a prayer from the
psalm of David, cause he's a David. So it's not July 2, but he was so
pumped about the idea that I decided I'd go ahead and offer that prayer.
So if you would please, bow with me as I go through a prayer from the
psalm of David. Oh lord you have searched us and you know us. You know
when we sit and when we rise. You perceive our thoughts from afar. You
discern our going out and our lying down and are familiar with all of
our ways. Before a word is on our tongues, you know it completely, oh
Lord. You ?? a sin behind and before, for you have laid your hand upon
us. Such knowledge is too wonderful for us and too lofty for us to
attain. Where can we go from your spirit? Where can we flee from your
presence? If we go up to the heavens you are there, if we make our bed
in the depths you are there, if we rise on the rings of the dawn, if we
set on the far side of the sea. Even there your hand will guide us, your
right hand will hold us fast. For you created our inner most being, you
knitted us together in our mother's wombs. We praise you because we are
fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful and we know
that full well. Our frames were not hidden from you when we were made in
a secret place. When we were woven together in the depths of the Earth
your eyes saw our unformed bodies and all the days ordained for us were
written in your book before one of them came to be. Search as though God
and know our hearts, test us and know our anxious thoughts. See if there
is any offensive way in us and lead us in the way everlasting. Amen
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen. I pledge allegiance to the God of the United States of America and
to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible
with liberty and justice for all.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Stanley, Representative Burr,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion pertaining today's calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I move that House Bill, or excuse me, Senate Bill 337 be
removed from today's calendar and recalendared for tomorrow, July 18.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection so ordered. For what purpose does the gentleman from
Craven, Representative Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution. The House will
come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very simple resolution. It doesn't
matter which side that you take on the gun issues. The bottom line is
we're all here to uphold the Constitution, and this is an amendment
letting our U.S. representatives know that our right to bear arms shall
not be infringed. That's pretty much the extent of what this does. And
?? of the House a copy of this, if it is approved, will go to each one
of our U.S. Congressmen and Senators and letting them know not to
infringe upon our rights here in North Carolina. I ask for your
approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To first ask Representative Speciale two questions and then to speak to
the bill please? And Mr. Speaker, it's very hard to hear back here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order. I would ask members who are having
conversations if you can to take those outside, please. Does the
gentleman from Craven yield to the gentleman from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you, Representative. I have just two
questions, and the first is with regard to line 19 of the House
Resolution, where it indicated that--19 and 20--where it indicated that
the President and Vice President and certain members of Congress have
proposed laws and regulations that would have the effect of infringing.
Are there specific proposals that this is in trying to encapsulate as
ones that you thought or that you think the House wants to send a sense
of, that were infringing? Are there specific ones that we can point to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any gun laws coming from</p>

<p id="010:00">
Federal government are in infringement. That's what infringement is, the
Constitution doesn't give the Federal government any authority over the
gun laws. That's a state issue. So when they're trying to pass laws, and
they were, at classifying certain things as assault weapons, or this or
that, all of that is an infringement upon our second amendment right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate that, and my follow up,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to state a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Craven yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative.
And then in the next paragraph, and I certainly understand several of
it, but where you have the word &quot;requiring extreme background
checks&quot;, what's the difference between an extreme background check
and a regular, where do you draw the line?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I'm gonna go back to what I said, anything coming from the Federal
government in regard to guns is in my opinion unconstitutional. It's a
state issue. However, to me an extreme law regarding background checks
would be saying that private sale from one person to another would be
extreme, if I want to give something to my brother, that'd be have to
run and get a background check first, within the family or whatever. And
those were the kind of things they were looking at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
To speak to the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Cumberland has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, and thank you again Representative for answering
the questions.
I  do not have any opposition to the law set out in Heller or MacDonald
on the second amendment, I think the court's been clear even though
those opinions have been highly divided, that Americans retain the right
under the Constitution to have weapons in their homes and to possess
those for purposes of self-defense and that neither the state nor the
federal government nor any local government can restrict that. But that
is a far cry from what this resolution is asking us to send to Congress.
First I think that the paragraph that starts off &quot;Whereas the
President and Vice-President&quot; is gratuitous. Aside from the fact
that it may include lots of presidents and vice-presidents, but assuming
it's aimed at the current administration, if we're trying to simply say
that we support the second amendment and urge Congress not to pass
legislation that restricts it, although I have some difficulty in that,
the way it would be framed, I would vote for that. But that's not what
this resolution says. This resolution essentially in those three lines
says, as was just stated. &quot;The President and Vice-President and
members of Congress&quot;, and attacks them for having proposed laws and
regulations that infringe on the right. But it doesn't even set out what
those laws are, except we now know that it's every law they proposed. No
matter what it was, because the sponsor of the resolution believes the
Federal government has no role in proposing any laws. And there is
nothing, nothing in the second amendment or the second amendment cases
that suggests that's the law. In fact, I think the Federal government
has the right to do some things and the court has upheld that. They are
barred from doing some others, but to pass a resolution that says the
Federal government has no right to legislate in this area at all I think
would be a shock to a lot of people. And there are certainly huge
numbers of firearms laws on the books in the Federal government that
protect a lot of people. So I have real problems with the overreach of
the resolution. I also have a problem in the second clause, although I
appreciate Rep. Speciale's comment, and I tend to agree that there is a
line on extreme because some background checks really do serve a
critical purpose, and others sound good but they're really not gonna get
where we want them to go.
But again I think it is probably not the language we would want to use
as a body without defining specifically what we think is problematic. So
because the lines 18 to 20 in my opinion are, number one, wrong as a
matter of law but number two, really attack unnecessarily so an
administration and members of Congress. And because I think paragraph, I
think begins with line 21, is probably something that should be written
a lot tighter. I have real concerns about this resolution and will be
voting no for those reasons. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what reason does the gentleman from Cabarrus, Rep. Pittman rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would say that the founding fathers,when they
put the second amendment into our United States constitution, had very
fresh in their memories the conflict they had recently won to gain our
freedom. And they recognized that no matter how great the Constitution
is, no matter</p>

…wonderful, a system of government they have given us there might at
some future time be people who would be in control of that government
who would not have respect for the people’s rights.
That’s the very reason the Second Amendment was placed into our
Constitution is because some day, and I don’t think it’s going to be in
our day, I certainly hope not, but there might be a time when the people
might have to fight for their freedom again against government. That’s
why the Second Amendment is primarily there.
The Second Amendment as far as allowing or disallowing, I think it very
clearly disallows the Federal government from interfering in the right
of the people to keep and bear arms. It doesn’t make any mention of any
kind of exceptions or any way around the fact that the government has no
right to infringe on our right to keep and bear arms.
That’s what this resolution is about is to remind the Federal government
that our Founding Fathers told them very plainly, in the Second
Amendment, “You don’t have that right.” We’re just trying to remind
Congress of that fact. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Lucas, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know this resolution places me in a
particular quandary. Many of you know that I am a card-carrying NRA
member and I firmly believe in Second Amendment rights. I’m an avid
hunter.
But I do know that certain assault weapons ought to be banned. This is
for military. Individuals have no right to have these kinds of weapons.
You don’t need these kinds of weapons to hunt. In fact I cringe to see
if someone shot 115 times at one innocent animal. That’s ridiculous.
Why would you need an assault weapon? To say that the President and the
Vice President have expressed interest in banning Second Amendment
rights, that ‘s not true. They have made mention of banning assault
weapons.
Our society ought to feel free. We ought to be a protected society and
we don’t need to be protected by individuals with assault weapons.
That’s what we have the military for. That’s why we have police
departments.
Why don’t we trust those who have been trained and hired to protect us?
So, this resolution is almost forcing me to vote, “No,” when I fully
support Second Amendment rights. So, I’d like to ask the gentleman a
question if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re wishing to ask Representative Speciale a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Craven yield to a question from the gentleman
from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Speciale. Speciale. I hope I was pronouncing
that correctly. Would you feel that under the Second Amendment that we
should allow anyone who can obtain a license, age 12 or whatever their
age is, eligible to get a gun permit, that we ought to allow anybody and
everybody to have assault weapons?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can’t answer that question because I don’t know what you mean by
“assault weapon.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
AR-15s. The weapons that shoot many, many times more than 10 up to 100
times rounds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t think that’s a question I can answer. I will address the
so-called assault weapon here in a moment when I get a chance to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.

Bumgardner rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If you can’t support this resolution, what can
you support? You either support the Constitution or you don’t. It says,
“A resolution expressing support for the preservation and defense of the
Constitution.” What is wrong with that?
“The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,” that’s what
the Constitution says. I have one here in my pocket I carry everywhere I
go, every day. You either believe that or you don’t. If you don’t then
stand up and say, “I don’t believe that and I want to get rid of part of
it.”</p>

For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux,
rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm glad folks are talking about the Constitution because we seem to
have a problem with how we interpret the Constitution and I'm looking at
this bill with ?? section 30 Article 1 of the State Constitution and I'm
looking at the part where it says that's in this bill &quot;nothing
herein shall justify, shall justify, the practice of carrying concealed
weapons or prevent the general assembly from enacting penal statutes
against that practice.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall,
rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair and I heard the question asked if you can't support
this you can't support the Constitution and this should be easy for
people to do. Well, first of all, we're asked to analyze what we look
at. I think Representative Michaux made the major point I wanted to
point to that it seems to be we want abide by the North Carolina
Constitution when it's convenient and when it's not we want to turn a
blind eye and ignore it the necessity of trying to single out
individuals in leadership. I note that our resolution there wasn't one
passed for us to say that members of the House and the Senate as well as
the Governor should abide by our Constitution, Article 30 at Section 1
as Representative Michaux, article 30 section 1 as Representative
Michaux referenced it. So I think the idea is a legitimate idea but I
think it was politicized by trying to direct it toward the Vice
President and the President of the United States specifically named by
title and then everyone else named as a part of Congress. So again I
think I will be voting against this not because of the overall
principles of the constitution that are involved and I have been not
only a member of the NRA for several years, but have maintained two
memberships and have indulged in both shooting sports and the profession
of training people to shoot for the greater part of my life and I don't
think this resolution accurately reflects the sense of the people of my
district or the sense of right thinking people in the state of North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative
Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just heard a couple comments about us picking and choosing what we're
going to believe, or what we're going to pay attention to in the North
Carolina Constitution.  This has nothing to do with the North Carolina
Constitution. Gun rights, or guns are a state issue, they're not a
federal issue. This particular resolution is focused on the federal
government, not the state government. We're not turning a blind eye to
the North Carolina Constitution. What we're telling our federal elected
officials is not to turn a blind eye to the US Constitution. The right
of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, it's very
simple. Shall not be infringed. They say prohibition against the federal
government. On line 20 starting on line 20, it says &quot;whereas in the
past reasons offered in support of these infringements such as
registering guns, banning certain kinds of weapons and accessories,
requiring extreme background checks, and restricting conceal carry
permits have not been shown by substantial weight of scientific evidence
to have been effective in accomplishing the stated objectives of such
restrictions&quot;. But again, by the federal government, and that's
what this thing is, we're counting on congressmen and our senators, when
you go to Washington and they start talking about banning our guns that
you need to stand strong and say &quot;look we simply don't have the
authority to do that&quot;. With regard to assault weapons, what is an
assault weapon? It's a made up term to describe any type of gun that the
left, or the gun control crowd, chooses to make up. The question for me
was, from my colleague there, would I think it would be appropriate 12
year olds to have an assault weapon.  Of course not. But there is a time
in this country where you were over the age of 16 years old you were
required to know how to shoot-</p>

<p id="025:00">
...to get a weapon. You are required to be able to handle a weapon. Why?
Why was it even put in the Constitution? It was put there so that we can
protect ourselves from our government. I keep hearing from people, I
hear, &quot;Well, that was different kind of rifles back then, they're
talking about muskets.&quot; I don't see anything in the Constitution
that says anything about muskets.
An AR-15 is typically what is described by the opposition as an assault
rifle. It is identical to...I'm a retired marine. The rifle that I had
on active duty looks just like the AR-15 that I have at home. If you put
them side by side, you probably couldn't tell the difference, except for
one little detail. The selector level on my rifle, my personal rifle,
has safe and semi. On a military rifle that I had, it has a third
selection which was automatic, or in the case of the current rifles,
three round bursts.
Automatic weapons have been illegal in the United States since the
1930's. My rifle, my AR-15, which looks just like my military rifle when
I was on active duty, shoots one round per pull of the trigger. Period.
It's no different than any hunting rifle, it just looks neat. And
because it looks neat, when we start passing these, when the Federal
government starts passing these laws, it makes people think that they're
actually doing something. They're actually accomplishing something. When
in fact, the are accomplishing nothing because there are rifles out
there that don't look quite as neat that are just as effective and do
exactly the same thing.
Again, there is no such thing as an assault rifle. The term has been
changed from year to year, from effort to effort by the gun control
folks. At one point if it had a pistol grip on it, it was considered an
assault rifle, except for this rifle, this rifle and this rifle. It's
just ridiculous. There's no commonality there.
The bottom line is that even if you don't like guns, even if you oppose
it, we are responsible. We were sent up here to uphold the Constitution
and the rights of the people. And this is one way to do that by telling
those of our folks that are in Washington that we know what our rights
are. We've read the Constitution, and we'd like you to read it, too. And
we'd like you to actually uphold our rights. And one of those rights
clearly stated is that the Federal government has no right to infringe
upon or rights to keep and bear arms.
I'd ask that you support this resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Martin rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the resolution's sponsor would yield to a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Craven yield to a question
from the gentleman from Wake?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where's the question ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much, Mr. Speaker and thank you,
Representative. First of all, a comment. You and I are showing our age.
They've actually moved onto M-4's now, even past us, there's still a few
of those M-16's out there but they're getting about as rusty as you and
I are, I think.
In your speech, sir, you mentioned that automatic weapons have been
illegal for quite some time. Is it he position of this resolution or is
the position that this resolution advocates for that the banning of
automatic weapons by the Federal government is too extreme and against
the Constitution?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This resolution does not advocate anything. It's
saying do not infringe upon our rights. It's not being specific about
anything. It's telling them read the Constitution and follow the
Constitution is basically what it's trying to tell them. Don't infringe
upon our rights. So as far as getting into the specifics about what it
can't and can do, you and I both know if we've read the Constitution
that the Federal government has no right banning or guns. Regardless of
what we may say in public, you and I know it because aren't you a
lawyer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield to speak. Not a very good one, but yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to propound an additional
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think if I could speak briefly on the bill, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much, Mr. Speaker. I've been unclear
on the purpose of the resolution. If it's to convey to our Federal
representatives not to infringe on our constitutional rights, I'm
confused on exactly what the position is on what our constitutional
rights are. What message are we sending to our legislators in D.C. to
protect our rights but we're not telling them what that means? Should
they maintain the Federal prohibition on automatic weapons? Or is that
something that we're trying to convey with this resolution that we want
them to repeal? It's not clear. It seems to me to be a meaningless
resolution and I'll be voting against it.

Representative Pittman rise. Speak a second time on the resolution. The
gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I just want to address a few points that have been
raised here. The idea of assault weapons is a specious designation which
has nothing to do with the function of the weapon as Representative
Speciale was pointing out. It's only cosmetics and I guess the
appearance of some weapons might frighten some people. But that's not a
reason to ban them when they're functionally no different from hunting
rifles and whether you want to hunt deer with a so-called assault
weapon, an AR-15 or whatever, or not, it's your business. Some people do
use them for hunting. My son has one and he will use it to hunt deer.
He's not gonna bam, bam, bam, bam. He's gonna fire one shot. Hopefully
that will get it done. But the appearance of the weapon has nothing to
do with that and shouldn't. Concerning Article 1, Section 30, I did
offer an amendment early this year that wasn't heard in committee. That
part about not being able to carry concealed weapons is obsolete and
ridiculous because we do have a concealed weapon, concealed carry permit
system now. So I was gonna just take that one part out of that article
and that section because it really shouldn't apply anymore since we do
have a system of concealed carry. Addressed to the federal government,
this resolution is addressed to the federal government, not to the state
and that's a separate question. The feeling that I have, and many people
who elected me because of things I've said about this, and people who
support me, agree with the statement that I'm gonna make right now. That
gun control laws only protect criminals and/or tyrants. The thing about
we've got to protect our people. Well, sometimes we can't be there to
protect our people. They have the right to protect themselves. And so
the right of the people to keep and bear arms must not be infringed and
we're reminding our federal government of that fact. I ask you to
support the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For that purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative
Brandon rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I remember this bill coming through committee and I have a lot of
respect for Representatives Speciale and Pittman and I admire your
passion for this subject. But I think it's very, we have to be very
careful when we are doing resolutions in this body and make sure that we
keep the integrity of it. Because this resolution, most resolutions that
we do, we do it with a big consensus and I think that the word whereas
is a word that should have factual statements behind that. And what we
have in this resolution is totally opinionated. There's nothing factual
about it. It's just your opinion that the government is trying to
infringe on that right. Well, there's about half of America who
disagrees with that. And so it's a very divided opinion and so when I
think, when we use the word whereas and we're going to do a House
joint-resolution and you're going to bind me to a resolution, then I
think it's very important that we use factual evidence or factual words
that go behind it. This resolution does not do that. It comes very short
of that and it's really just an opinion of people that feel like the
federal government does that. And if the federal government was actually
trying to take the rights of people, I think the Supreme Court, which
supports most of the things that you talk about, would have done
something about it. I think it's a lot of paranoia going along and I
think there's a lot of rhetoric going along. But I don't actually think
there's any actual factual evidence in this resolution and I think that
we have to be very careful because I can make a resolution and say, hey
therefore we should not, we should have a resolution saying we shouldn't
mean to do anymore Bush tax cuts cause they didn't work. And so I'm sure
that every, that's an opinion. And so, we don't want to get into that
business in this general assembly where we just make resolutions based
off of opinion. I think they should be based off of facts. Thank you.

For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover, Representative
Davis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The speaker has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. In listening to the debate, the federal government is
involved with gun control. There are federal laws that govern what
people can and can not do with guns. So this is an issue that involves
the federal government and when I was an assistant United States
attorney, I prosecuted people for violating federal gun laws. So I'm
just wondering, in once again listening to this debate, if the sponsors
might consider a modification, an amendment to Section 1 that states,
and opposes any infringement by the federal government of the right of
the people of this state to lawfully keep and bear arms.</p>

to be preventive from regulating the use of guns through federal
legislation.  And I just offer that if the bills sponsors might want to
consider that if that would help to appease those that seem to have

which gives us the highest marginal rates in the Southeast, was bad
economic policy that punishes success and is a disincentive for folks to
move forward.  I tried to explain to you that going from 7.75% down to
5.8 and then 5.75 how I believe and still believe that will spur
economic growth.  I tried to explain to you how the measured reduction
in our corporate income tax would make us more competitive with the
states that surround us in not only attracting new jobs but in retaining
the good jobs that we have.  Now I know that there's ...[AUDIO ENDS]</p>

<p id="040:00">
Going to be some debate on this bill today and I look forward to it. I
thought I might speak to a few of the points that I think you may hear.
First of all, there’s been awful lot of talk about the tax cuts. This is
a tax cut bill, this cuts taxes. I want you to know it’s every
Republicans dream to be able to say that they cut taxes. And this bill
does do that. It does cuts the personal income taxes of every north
Carolinian who’s paying taxes. Now someone will make fun of that and say
oh those on the lower end of the scale are only getting an 80 dollar
break while those making 4 million dollars are getting a huge break.
Well, those making the 4 million are paying more in taxes than those
making the 20,000.  Proportionately the ones making the 20, the ones on
the lower end of the scale are getting a higher percentage cut than
those on the upper income scale. You’re going to hear things today, that
we’ve not protected working families. I pointed out to you that we’ve
enhanced the child tax credit from 100 to 125 dollars for those families
making 40,000 a year or less.  You’re going to hear things today like oh
we’re going to gut state revenue. We’re going to gut the ability of the
state to grow and to handle its responsibilities in the future. Let me
just say for the record to be very clear. Very clear.  According to our
fiscal staff, this bill produces from the date its signed out through
the fiscal year 2017-2018.  It provides for revenue growth of 3.2
billion dollars. That is a 15.9% revenue growth over the next 5 years.
We believe that because of responsible budgeting we believe in better
management in the executive branch.  We believe because of the efforts
that are going to be forthcoming in Medicaid reform that a growth of
15.9%, a growth in revenue, total revenue of 15.9% or3.2 billion
dollars, is going to be adequate to meet the needs of our growing state.
You’re going to hear today about various provisions in the bill. I stand
ready to try to address those. You’re going to hear one of my personal
favorites, is that this isn’t real tax, this isn’t real tax reform. Well
let me be clear, we’ve said from the beginning, that this is a
continuing process. This is a step in the right direction, this is a
step in getting our fiscal house in order. Its a step that we began a
biennium ago when we repealed, when we cut the sales tax which even my
friends who are going to vote against this bill, will acknowledge is the
most regressive tax, we cut the sales  tax, and other taxes last year,
helping the working families of the state. We’ve gone through and done
further reforms. We’ve reformed the workers comp system we’ve reformed
the unemployment insurance system I know not everyone agrees with the
way that these reforms have been done. But I want to make the point loud
and clear that we’ve said all along</p>

<p id="045:00">
That tax reform is a journey. It’s not a destination. It’s a continuing
evolving thing just like our economy just like our the people of this
state continue to evolve continue to change. This bill provides that
there’s many more issues in our tax code that will be reviewed by
revenue laws so that we’ll be back before you I believe you in 2014 with
an additional round, with an additional step forward towards true tax
reform. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Durham Representative Michaux rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m wondering if you would yield for one small
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
from Harnett yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry to interrupt you. I
don’t normally do this but you keep making a statement that you all cut
the tax last year, the sales tax last year. Did not that tax expire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for bringing that up, Representative
Michaux. Yes. When the Democrats were in charged and imposed the
terribly regressive sales tax on the families of the state they did so
with a sunset. And then they broke their promise by continuing to renew
the sunset over and over again which we did not do. Thank you for the
[CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask another question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’m up for it if he is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SOUND].
We both up for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] How many times did we renew that,
that one percent sales tax that you’re talking about? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative I can tell you that I know it was imposed in zero three
and renewed, we vote on the budget every year. So it would either be six
or eight times. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to ask an
additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman from Harnett yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you sure of that
Representative? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux I’ll be glad to
get staff to refer to that, I mean to get you the exact numbers on that.
I will just say the time that I know that the sales tax increase was
actively discussed was in the budget that Governor Purdue purposed in
2009. That I pretty sure was, was retained. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman gentleman from Harnett continues to have to have the floor do
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. So we’re also
gonna hear talk about the impact that the expanded sales tax is going to
have. Well, you know, we’ve talked about that before. We’ve asked our
staff to tell us what the impact on the average North Carolina family’s
going to be. I’ll be happy to distribute the email to you which
basically says it’s so small that they don’t really even know how to
estimate it. We did not expand this into services. That was a, I think
that’s an important part. I think that’s a part that needs to be
addressed in the next round of tax reform. But it’s not in this bill. So
let’s just, let’s just be clear the expansion of the sales tax base in
this bill does include extended warranties and service contracts because
those are actually products that are sold alongside with the good that
is bought and taxed. It makes sense. Forgive me. I’m trying to recall
all of the stuff I learned at the press, the press conference [LAUGH]
yesterday. You know the bottom line to me and, and to be, to be fair,
we’re going to hear today about the repeal of the earned income tax
credit. And I know that it’s not in this bill. I know that it helped
some struggling families in this state. But what this bill before you
does is that it lowers their tax burden. It lowers the amount of taxes
that they have to pay. That’s what a tax bill does. It addresses tax
policy. Not really social engineering.</p>

<p id="050:00">
The bottom line and this will conclude my remarks for now. Yes, yes,
this bill does contemplate the reduction, the reduction in the increase
in revenue over a 5 year period of about 2.4 billion dollars. What this
bill cannot – what we cannot reflect on a piece of paper, as you know
our staff, economists have to use static models. What we can’t account
for on a piece of paper is our belief, our philosophical belief,  that
better tax policy, that letting everybody keep more money in their
pocket creates economic growth and creates opportunities for people to
better themselves, to take care of their families, to meet their
obligations. We believe it’s a fair and equitable way to finance the
needs of the state, The essential services of the state. We believe it
accounts for the growth and expanded needs of a growing state. And I
would respectfully ask that you support the congress report and let’s
move our state forward, let’s take this next important step in tax
reform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Scotland, representative Pierce
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to ask a question, please
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Harnet yield to the gentleman from Scotland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Always Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He Yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis you made a statement and i wanted to get it before
I forget myself. And if you cut the low – you made a point about 80
dollars would be given to, break to some folks. Let me ask you a
question. If they get that cut, will there be other taxes that, in spite
of the $80 everyone is throwing around.  Would there be other services
that would have to be taxed, that would have them still paying more
taxes. I’m getting the $80 break in one hand but you’ve got other things
that’s gonna be taxed that would really almost double form getting $80
over where without ending up paying $160 in other services and taxes, if
you could follow up for me, thank you Mr. Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well thank you for thank you for that inquiry representative. The short
answer is that there are additional taxes that are in this bill. We do
not believe the impact on the working families in this state will be
negative, we believe it will be positive. What you find in this bill,
just so we can be clear, that there are things, like electricity which
are now subject to state sales tax. Well, what the bill, and what hasn’t
been discussed at all on this floor is that, there has always been tax
there. There was a smaller amount of sales tax and then there was a
hidden franchise tax. So, I’m very proud of the fact that this bill
makes the taxation of the state more transparent, more open, easier to
understand. And thank you for the chance to Address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow up, Mr. Leader.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to ask an additional question, and does the
gentleman from Harnet yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To your point representative Lewis. So in reality, the low wage earners,
and in reality, I think you said but I just want to be clear for myself,
so it’s a possibility they will end up paying more taxes, will they end
up paying more taxes? That’s what I want to be clear on so when I talk
to my constituents I can say “well in reality you getting a cut, but in
reality you’re paying more taxes. Am I correct on that or is that not
true?

Goodman Rise?

<p id="055:00">
I feel like I need to do it so if I ramble a little bit I hope you will
grant me a little bit of latitude. First I want to congratulate
Representative Lewis and the people that brought this bill forth for
doing a lot of hard work and trying to bring us tax reform. My problem
with it is I think they have failed to do that and I understand it. I
don't believe that one party can do tax reform. I hear a lot of debate
back and forth over here when we complain and say this isn't real tax
reform you guys say, &quot;well why didn't you do tax reform when you
were in charge?&quot; Well, I don't think you can do it. I think the
majority tried to put it out there. There were several Senate proposals
and several in the House but when you got out there you just didn't want
to take the hit that was required to do real tax reform. I feel like
that it would have been better if we had all gotten together, you'd come
to some members over on our side and say what are your views about tax
reform? What do you think? And gotten everybody together and done a real
tax reform plan and then we could have all held hands and jumped off the
bridge together and we could have really gotten some real reform done. I
don't believe this is real reform. It is a tax cut and I understand that
we all want lower business taxes but the fact of the matter is that
every small business in North Carolina is going to get a tax increase
and it's because we're going to eliminate the $50,000 exemption, the
exemption on the first $50,000 in income that small businesses have to
pay. So there are, probably the majority of businesses in North
Carolina, are going to get a tax increase and I have a problem with
that. And I know in the bill that we passed in the last session there
were some problems with it where these equity partners in large law
firms that were making huge amounts of money were going to get it to but
they don't mind giving it up because they're going to get a big break on
the other end. So it's not a problem for them. But if you're running a
small business in a rural part of North Carolina and your whole business
profit is $75-$80,000 a year this is a big numbers. It's going to make a
big difference in what you do and also, if you're in rural North
Carolina, Representative Lewis you mentioned the earned income tax
credit, I know it's not in this bill but removing the earned income tax
credit, which was part of the tax policy that was introduced during this
session takes about 3 million dollars out of the economy annually and we
can't afford that. Our constituents don't have the money that people do,
maybe in the triangle, that have some of these higher paying jobs and
that little bit of money means a lot to small retailers and businesses
that are trying to survive in rural parts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from, lady from Mecklenburg,
Representative Samuelson, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to ask the gentleman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Richmond yield to the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm empathetic with the concerns about the income, the hit on your
county because of the earned income tax credit, but wouldn't, how much
would you guess that the lowering of the overall tax rate and raising
the exemption amount for everybody also impact your county?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I don't have those numbers but I haven't seen anything yet that
impacted our county economically in a positive way that's come out of
this legislature.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask a follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Have you seen the spreadsheets that show in just about every income
bracket they will be paying less income tax with this tax policy?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have seen those spreadsheets. Again, my comment was if we had kept the
earned income tax credit there would be about 3 million dollars more in
our economy than there is now. That was my point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to continue debating the bill.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative
Hastings, arise?

To see if Representative Goodman would yield for a question.

Does the gentleman from Richmond yield to a question from the gentleman
from Gaston?

for schedule C filers, I think. Is that correct?

to direct the comments to the chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry, my
apologies. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Gaston wish to
further propound his question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I wanted to- What
I was refering to is Schedule C filer that we passed tax cuts for
through the exemption in the last biennial. And what I was asking you
was: Do you realize as a Schedule C, small business owner, that those
taxes flow through our personal returns which means that a reduction in
the tax rates is going to give us a tax cut? Did you realize that?

question from the gentleman from Gaston? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did I say C corp? I think
I said Schedule C filer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, I'm- may I respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman- [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, I'm not a tax
expert, so I'll defer to your comment for now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But if I may continue, I understand
that we need lower taxes on business. I like a lot of things in this
bill. I think corporate taxes should be lower. I think that lower
marginal tax rates are good economic policy, but generally when you
lower marginal rates so that the next dollar you earn doesn't cost you
more than the last dollar you earned, generally you eliminate deductions
and loopholes to offset it. There was an attempt made there with three,
four, five, services that the bill throws out there to that say we did a
tax reform bill, but it was just a few things. It was not real tax
reform; And my point is: I like lower taxes, I like lower income taxes;
but my suggestion is that we throw this bill out, get together with
members of both parties, and do a bipartisan tax reform bill that really
is true tax reform for North Carolina. Thank you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glazier rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill
briefly Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman has the floor to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, and I join with the
eloquent and well thought out comments of representative Goodman, but I
want to start off in much the same way and first, to say thank you to
Representative Lewis and Setzer and Mobley, and others who worked on the
plan. For a lot of the political reasons Goodman suggested, I think, he
is right about why reform in any real way is not happened in this body,
and why is still not happening today, but the effort that has been made
in this bill has been substantial over a very long period of time. And I
agree completely with Representative Lewis on his point that he made,
which should be lost on the body that this is a journey and that it is a
marathon, not a sprint, to make change. My concern is that the
destination the bill takes us to is not going to end up being the
destination that lies behind the bills' sponsors plans. So I think it
will briefly describe why I'm concerned about that. First I have a real
concern that the bill- and this was said yesterday on the floor that
there have been experts for a long time in the state and probably all of
us in each party have campaigned on this of the need to reform the
system built in the 1930s. And we have all also talked about with
experts in both parties and most economists talking about what that
system change outta look like. This bill encompases a portion of that,
but not a bunch of it. But the one thing that got left out is what every
one of those study said, including the emerging issues studies and
others, was when you do this, you really need to make it revenue
neutral. And this is not revenue neutral- not intended to be. And I
think that's a given the times and the economy, a huge mistake.
Secondly, because of that mistake, and several others I'll highlight, I
think it will end up putting in serious jeopardy the state's bond
ratings. Which I think is an enormous economic issue for the state. And
I think that will happen because overall, I think the majority- that's
the farm- want a particular ??</p>

<p id="065:00">
That has traditionally not held out in those states that have tried this
theory or empirically, and I'll suggest why in a minute. And because I
think that the theory is not sustainable, it provides no long term
stability and I think the bonding houses will react to that over time.
It is not just as Representative Goodman said. For the most part, this
is a tax cut and a tax shift, and not really major reform. I think that
the majority started this process to do that, to have reform. But I'm
not sure it's fair to say that this is. It is certainly fair to say it
is a change in tax policy. It is certainly fair to say that some of what
is in here, most of us could agree to. I have since the day I got
elected to legislature in 2002, argued for the cut, supported cuts, and
voted for cuts, and filed bills with cuts for corporate income tax
rates. I'm not one of the most - not on my side of the aisle- something
that happened all that often during my tenure. But I think there's good
legitimate reason for that and I support that portion of the bill and I
particularly support the trigger provisions in the bill. But in order
for this theory to work, there has got to be one of two things that
happens with the tax change. There has either got to be enough that is
given to the middle class and lower class from the cut that they may
get, assuming that there is one - and I know that there is this argument
over whether it will be eighty dollars to the one side or the other- but
assuming, it doesn't matter. There's either got to be enough that's
given where it substantially increases the consumption power of the
middle class or the lower middle class or the lower economic class to
purchase more in order to generate demand and then jobs, or the bill has
to shift in the philosophy the other way which would be that the tax
cuts at the wealthy end have to be so substantial that there's just no
doubt some if it will be used for the creation of additional
entrepreneurial and job opportunities. And we don't have that either
here. Even though the argument is certainly that it cuts much more that
way than the other. But in that sense I think the bill does, in an
attempt to create this first step that the majority talks about, doesn't
do that. It doesn't do anything but give the tax cut that can generally
and for the most part will likely be saved by the people getting it with
little additional consumption capacity or job creation capacity. And
that is my fear. Because if those things take place differently than the
majority feels like might happen, then in the end all we have is a tax
cut, a tax shift, and a dramatic reduction in revenue capacity to
function the infrastructure needs of the state. And we get not the best
of all worlds, we get the worst possible outcome. And I fear that's the
outcome that's more likely. In the end, I think Representative Starnes
made a point the other day that this bill is of historic proportions. I
don't know I agree it's of historic proportions, but it's certainly a
significant change and I know it was certainly vetted in a compromised
way with the Senate and the Governor, and I'm sad that it wasn't vetted
with the public in a more complete way once this proposal came out or
with the democratic minority because I think there are parts of this
plan that are good. But the overall plan, to me, because the theory ends
up being wrong and not one borne out anywhere else that I know of in the
country, I fear that in the end the plan will lead to a very different
result than what the majority is intending it to do. And because of
that, not because of any specific provision, and not without very strong
accolades to the creators of a very tough plan, but because I think this
is a very wrong decision for the state for all the reasons
Representative Goodman said, I'm going to be voting no.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, as I read

<p id="070:00">
I just start by saying that I think that many of my colleagues here
would agree with me that this is what we are sent  here to do. When I
first ran for this office, people who sent me here were very concerned
about the tax policies in the state. Not only by how the taxes were
collected but particular how much taxes were being collected. We got
here in 2011 we have seen six major tax increases in the past 8 years.
And during that time North Carolina has been catapulted to having the
top tax burden in our region of the country, in the sixteen states
south. Also during that time North Carolina continue to fall in the
employment scale. And I believe we have seen North Carolina mired near
the bottom of the country when it comes to unemployment for the last 4
years. I wanted to share with you a little story that some of you might
be familiar with. This is an analogy if you will this is not my story
but this was out together by some folks that probably know a lot more
about tax system at least have the credentials better than I did. But I
think this puts it in perspective when we hear the continued  backlash
about the fact that people at the lower end of the scale are not getting
as big a tax cut if you will than the people at the higher end. And may
be we will talk a little bit about who the people at the higher end
really are. But here is the story supposed at every day ten men were to
go out  to dinner together and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If
they pay that bill the way that we pay our taxes, it would go something
like this.
The first four men  are those at the lower end of pay scale and would
pay absolutely nothing. The fifth would pay $1, the sixth would pay $3 ,
the seventh would pay $7, the eighth would pay $12, the ninth would pay
$18 and the tenth man or the wealthiest man if you will would pay $59.
So that’s what they decided to do. One day the restaurant owner decided
that he would offer them a discount or tax cut if you will. Because they
were such good customers their bill would be lowered by $20 and the
total bill would come to only 80. The problem was with how would they
divide the discount. You see if everyone got $2 back well half the men
would actually  be paid money in order to eat dinner. . So the
restaurant owner suggested that perhaps it would be fair to reduce each
one’s bill by a percentage and still maintain this progressive system of
payment. So the fifth man like the first four would pay nothing, 100%
saving. The sixth would pay $2 instead of $3  so he would save 33%., the
seventh would pay  would be paying $5 instead of $7 saving 28%, the
eight would pay 9 instead of 12 saving 25%, the ninth would pay 14
instead of 18 or 22% savings and the 10th would  pay 49 instead of 59
which would be a 16% saving. So each of the six payers were better off
than before and the first four would continue to eat for free. But once
they were outside the restaurant, the men started to compare their
savings. The sixth man declared well I only got $1 out of the $20 that
we are saving. He pointed to the 10th man but he got $10. That’s right
said the fifth man I only saved a dollar too. But it’s unfair that he
got ten times as much savings as I did. That’s true shouted the seventh
man why should I only get $2 back. He got $10 back. The wealthy get all
the breaks. Wait a minute yelled the first four man in unison, we didn’t
get anything at all. This just explains the point.  So then the nine men
surrounded the 10th man and beat him up. So the next night the 10th man
didn’t show up for dinner and the nine sat down and had their dinner
without him and when it came time to pay the bill they `discovered one
important thing. Between them they did not have enough money to pay even
half the bill.  So what’s the moral of the story. What’s the point. Well
some of the comments that we hear around here, I understand the rhetoric
. I understand the need to demonize the people at the top if you will.
These people at the top</p>

By the way, most of these, or may of these are businesses.  These are
the people that create the jobs in the state. The much needed jobs in
this state, the state the jobs that we’ve been losing as we’ve
catapulted to the top of the tax burden in our region.  So I would
suggest and I will support this bill and I would suggest that you do as
well. And I think that one of the effects we will see that, as we bring
North Carolina more competitive with our neighbors in the way that we do
personal income tax and the way that we do corporate income tax, and the
way that we treat different kinds of taxes. I believe we will see that
we will bring our state into a better competitive environment. One that
will attract more businesses, not only to come here, but to stay here
and to grow and not to cut back.  Because ladies and gentlemen,
businesses will look to locate, and they will look to stay and they will
look to operate in those places where they can thrive and make money.
So I suggest that this is a good bill. As Representative Lewis said, it
is a journey and not a destination. I think this is a good step. I think
it’s a step we should take today and I commend the bill to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. Representative Lewis a
few minutes ago said we cannot put on paper what we feel like the
outcome is going to be for the enactment of this tax reform package. I
would suggest that each of you go to your favorite web search engine and
enter economy following tax cuts and it will show you repeatedly in
America’s economical, economic history what happens when government cuts
tax rates. We use practice in criminal law which says the higher, we put
the penalty, the less inclined people are to commit the crime.  The same
holds when you raise taxes. The higher they get the less inclined people
are to pay them. What happens is we find loopsholes. We find exceptions.
We find exemptions. And we do not collect the money that we as a
government, if you want to put the word entitled to, based on the
production of the citizens of this state, because people find ways
around paying it when it gets too onerous. When we bring it down to a
reasonable level, which reasonable is that we determine how much
government we should give the people and they won’t, then we should
determine how much we should pay for it.  Raising it, you’re going to
get less taxes. Lowering it, you’re going to get more.  Study history.
Thank you. Please support the bill.

Representative Lewis, I just wanted to sort of ask you a question
because I get confused on what the argument’s about. Under this tax
bill, aren’t all individual citizens paying the same percentage of their
income and getting exactly the same exemptions as everybody else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, that was the intent to make the rates the same as opposed to one
that would tax more or penalize success.

If I could do a follow up?

The lady wishes to ask an additional question. Does the gentleman yield
to an additional question?

<p id="080:00">
Representative: Interfering with all of the millions of choices that go
on in an economy like ours because it changes the incentives to save,
work and invest, and do all the positive things we want. So, this
incredible power should be exercised very sparingly, very reluctantly,
and with great sobriety. It has not always been that way in this country
and in this state. What we are doing here affects all of the citizens of
the state because the state can actually come – if the taxes we impose
on the citizens are not paid, the full force of the law can come down on
the citizen and the sheriff can ultimately come and take his or her
property away. So this is something we have to use very good judgment in
doing. There is a lot of economic history that would indicate that when
levels of taxation get too high, we do not get a lot of the things we
want: the savings, the investment, the economic activity. That is what
this bill was designed to do: it was designed to simplify taxes, it was
designed to lower the burden so that we will get overall economic
growth, and ultimately, we hope, even more tax revenue because the
economy will grow more. There is significant economic history, despite a
handout I saw today, if you trace the history of the income tax, you saw
this play out – you saw it play out in the 20’s. The income tax was new
in the teens to help finance World War I and grew to incredible marginal
rates, then were lowered in the 20’s: you had the roaring 20’s. They
came to an end with a huge tax increase called the [xx] tariff. In world
war II, the rates got high again; and in post world war II, we saw the
same thing as the rates came down, economic activity increased. We saw
it again in 1983, with the ’81 tax cuts, when they finally went into
full effect, you had an economic boom that lasted 20 years. So there is
economic history and I would just site to the minority some quotes from
President John F. Kennedy. In 1963, he instituted what is called the
Kennedy round of tax cuts which led to the economic strength we saw in
the 1960’s. It is a paradoxical truth that taxes are too high, and tax
revenue too low, and the soundest way to raise revenues is to cut rates…
Speaker: [interrupting] For what purpose does the gentleman from
Richmond, Representative Goodman, rise?
Representative: To ask a question please.
Representative: I yield.
Speaker: He yields.
Representative: Representative Bluss, can you tell me what the top tax
rate was when President Kennedy recommended those tax reductions?
Representative: I believe the top rate at that time was 90 and went down
to 70, and then President Reagan lowered the top rate from 70 down to 50
in 1983, and then in the ’86 act it went down from 50 down to 28%. Each
time we saw a corresponding increase in economic activity that more than
made up for the tax cut.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Speaker: The gentleman from Gilford continues to have the floor to
continue to debate the bill.
Representative: There is another point, I think, that really needs to be
made here listening to all the rhetoric – and we heard less of it today
than yesterday. We always here income tax cuts as income tax cuts for
the wealthy. I would point out to the body that an income tax is not a
wealth tax. There is a wealth tax, to a degree, in our municipalities
and counties, i.e. the property tax. The federal tax on estates, which
some call the death tax, is a wealth tax because you add up the value of
your assets at date of death minus liabilities and apply a tax rate to
that. So that is a tax on wealth. Income is taxed annually at whatever
someone makes in income, defined in section 61 of the tax code minus all
the legal exemptions, deductions and credits, and that is taxed, but
that tax, that gross income on that tax, is not necessarily indicative
of</p>

<p id="085:00">
...it can be, but not necessarily. There are high income individuals who
are deeply in debt and would owe zero on the estate tax if they were to
die. So it's not correct to call it a tax on the &quot;wealthy&quot;.
And I know this issue can be demagogue to death and I'm sure it will be
attempted to be, but the big reason for doing what we're doing is
exactly what President Kennedy said and I could read you even more
quotes. We're trying to stimulate economic growth. We as a legislature
and a state are faced with an enormous problem over the next several
years and the problem is basically that politicians in the past have
promised from government a whole lot more than can be delivered at
present trajectories. And one of the ways, other than restraining
spending, which has to be done, is to create economic growth. We are not
going to meet the needs of the state if we don't somehow get economic
growth and increase jobs, and this is designed to attempt to do that
based upon experience in the past, historical experience. I think others
have made the point that we are competing with other states for some of
this industry and this growth and these plants. and it is just necessary
to bring our rates in line and make them competitive with negative
states. But we hope that this is going to work out and help all the
people in the state. One thing President Kennedy is, &quot;A rising tide
raises all boats,&quot; and that's what we're trying to do. I'm sure
we'll get criticized in some quarters for it, we'll get called bad names
and ascribed bad motives, but there aren't bad motives behind this.
There aren't bad motives behind this. We are trying to help all the
people in the State and I heard your adoption of the confidence report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. For what purpose
does the gentleman from Richmond, Representative Goodman rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'd like to just make a couple
really quick points. One is that when President Kennedy and President
Reagan lowered rates, rates were a lot higher. There is a place where
you hit a point of diminishing returns. And second I would just like to
point out that when President Reagan lowered rates to the 28 % I think
was his top rate, they eliminated a lot of loopholes and a lot of places
where people hide money. But even then he had to go back and pass the
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, and had to go back and raise taxes.
Actually I think he did it five times to make his numbers work out so I
just wanted to make that point. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what reason does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was wondering if the gentleman from Richmond would
yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman from Richmond yield to a question from the
gentleman from Harnett?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. I wanted to ask, in your earlier
remarks, you indicate that in your belief this was not tax reformed. And
in the remarks that you just made you spoke to loopholes, or what we
would agree would be called special tax treatment. Would it be fair to
say that the elimination of special tax treatments would be tax
reformed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It would but you trade off lower tax rates for that. I
mean you don't want anybody's tax rates to go up. That's one of the
things I've heard in here today that indicates that people over here
want to raise people's taxes. We don't. I want to be able to have lower
taxes but I want it to be done in a more comprehensive way instead of
just.. You know there have been a lot of attempts here in this session
to have tax reform and a lot of things that trial ??? have thrown out
there. When they got attacked they were brought back down. So I just
think we could do this better. That's my only point that I would like to
make.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask him one additional question, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.

That there is often a trade off between special tax treatments and the
ability to impact rates. And I agree with you on that. Would you agree

treatments does amount to a positive step in tax reform?

Actually, I do agree as far as it goes and I appreciate what you said

Further discussion? Further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the adoption of the committee report for House Bill 998 on it's
third reading. So many as favor the adoption of the report will vote
aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk
will lock the machine and record the vote, 77 having voted in the
affirmative and 36 in the negative. The
conference report for House Bill 998, on it's third reading, is adopted

the courtesies of the gallery to the children of Representative Dennis

welcome them. Representative Riddell, I believe you could fully staff
our pages for the week each week there. Members in consultation both
with the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader.
We are going to go into recess until 1:15. That will allow members to
have a proper lunch. I know if you have already had tomato sandwiches
and so forth. But it does appear that the next few bills could take
awhile and it's session may go on. So with that being said, the House is

that the bill be placed on tomorrow's calendar.

And then on page two again, earlier today we removed Senate Bill 480
from the calendar. That is a roll call bill and in order to finish that
up by tomorrow, we do need to have second reading. So I would move that
Senate Bill 480 be placed on today's calendar, removed from tomorrow's

And members, 480 is on the sheet, is on your regular calendar. It's at

this year what we did in 2011.  I'd appreciate your support.  [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Further discussion for the debate on the amendment for what
purpose does the gentlemen from Rowan Representative Warren rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak to the amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] The
gentleman has the floor to speak to the amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Ladies and Gentlemen the part of the bill that
Representative Cleveland's proposing we delete from the bill is a
provision we included to supersede the exemption for seasonal workers in
the e-verify bill passed last session because it's not in compliance
with the MOU or the e-verify program.  We based that definition in the
current PCS before us on the definition straight out of the department
of labor's  H2A program regarding temporary agricultural workers and I
want to read you part of that because it is almost verbatim what we have
in the bill that he's proposing to delete. It says employment is of a
seasonal nature where it is tied to a certain time of the year by an
event or pattern such as a short annual growing cycle and
requires labor levels above what is necessary  for ongoing operations.
Employment is of a temporary nature when the employer's need to fill the
position with a temporary worker will, except in extraordinary
circumstances, last no longer than a year.  Yesterday when we presented
the bill that's
what we had in there, that it would be less than a year.  When
Representative Brown submitted the amendment to turn this to a study
bill we also cut this back to 10 months.  The reason for that is that
particular definition was selected to accommodate a various consecutive
harvest crop cycles that
require temporary employment but are protracted over a cyclical time.
So we thought 10 months was adequate even though the H2A definition
actually allows as it says here in extraordinary circumstances would
allow to go beyond a year we cut it off at 10 months.  Agriculture is a
$72 billion to $74 billion a year industry in North Carolina and they
run into problems this is no way authorizes the hiring of illegal
immigrants or illegal workers. And I encourage you to vote no on the
amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGE] To what purpose does the
gentleman from Onslow Representative Cleveland rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] To
speak again on the amendment.[SPEAKER CHANGE]The gentleman has the floor
to debate the amendment a second time.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. Using the
H2A definition for our e-verify bills in ??.  If everyone used the H2A
program we would be better off.  But they ignore it.  Presently the bill
says that the temporary employee is 90 days.  And 90 days is more than
sufficient time to get a crop out of the field.  And they could move
from employer to employer with no problem and do the work that has to be
done.  The H2A program is a good program
and as I said earlier if everyone utilized it we would not have the near
the problems in the state that we have presently.  I would encourage you
to support the amendment and put the 90 day provision back in the bill.
Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] To what purpose does the gentlement from
Nash Representative Collins rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the
amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] Well
I know a lot of the farmers in my area use the H2A employees and some of
them don't and I didn't realize until just this debate started the
reason now I guess why some of them don't I thought they were just maybe
skirting the law. But if all they can use a H2A employee for is 90 days
I understand why they don't 'cause the season employees that come to do
agriculture work in my area come up in May and begin to pick cucumbers
then they go through the tobacco season picking tobacco then they
eventually they wind up picking sweet potatoes in November so that's
about a 7 month process.  So if we are limiting them to 90 days by this
amendment I am certainly against it and I encourage you to vote against
the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] . To what purpose does the gentleman from
Rowan Representative Warren rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak to the
amendment a second time.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has the floor
to debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Once again what
I want to stress is
that the caveat we put in e-verify 2 that Representative Cleveland and I
both pushed through here last session is not binding.  It is again a
violation of MOU for e-verify so we need what is in the current bill we
need that for various businesses, agriculture particular, and I think it
is
appropriate to use the H2A definition that is there for agriculture so
again I encourage you to let's do the right thing and vote this
amendment down.</p>

For what purpose does the gentleman from Pender, Representative Millis,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Collins a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Nash yield to a question from the gentleman from
Pender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, in regard to your statements about those farmers
in your district using the H2A program and under the understanding that
the current revised definition of our e-verified opens it up in regards
to seasonal workers.  So it doesn't restrict it for 90 days.  Therefore
that reflects the H2A definition that is not restrictive for 90 days.
So my question to you is I'm having a hard time understanding for those
farmers in your district that are using the H2A program then why are
they having trouble with the 90 day provision that has nothing to do
with the H2A program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was led to believe by what Representative Cleveland just said a minute
ago that the H2A program does utilize that definition that we're now
restricting to 90 days.  That's what I was led to believe by the
arguments so far.  If you could correct that, I'd be happy to understand
that better.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Duplin, Representative Dixon,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the 90 day window is not sufficient.
Please vote No on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Transylvania, Representative
Whitmire, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of the sponsor or, actually, of the bill's sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman...the amendment sponsor or the bill sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That'd be the bill sponsor, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Rowan yield to a question from the gentleman
from Transylvania.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question would be this:  as far as loopholes being potentially
widened, certainly the farm sector of our economy is very important and
I live on the farm that's been in my family for eight generations.  I've
worked that farm for many, many, many, many years of my life.  That
being said, security, domestic threats, labor.  There's a balance here,
and I go with security.  When it comes to going from a year to ten
months or 90 days in weighing that, certainly there are times when maybe
you have your cucumbers early in the year and your sweet potatoes late
in the year under the same farm.  But are not most, question number one,
most of these going from one farm operation to another and 90 days would
suffice for that?  And the second question is are we opening this door
well beyond agriculture to other industries that compete with people who
are here who are also looking for work, and I don't buy the statement
that a lot of times people won't do that type of work.  So, two
questions please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, the first question about the 90 day length, no, it's not
sufficient.  I agree with Representative Collins and Representative
Dixon on that.  The nature of the people who are migratory workers will
start sometimes in Florida and work their way up the coast.  You're
working with a whole different group.  They follow the crop harvest.
And it depends on what type of crop your harvesting whether they come
early in March or April or you're doing late-blooming crops in October.
So that window isn't there, but it was a sufficient enough definition.
That was what the Department of Labor settled on so I figured it would
be adequate for us.
I'm sorry, what was the second question?  Oh, opening the window?  I
believe that any piece of legislation we pass up here can be
circumvented.  Everything we do up here, we try to do with the best of
intentions.  I believe that in my heart.  But what it comes down to in
actual application is it comes down the the individuals sense of
morality, integrity, and character.  Can somebody get around a ten month
window or a 90 day window?  Just as easily either one I would say,
Representative Whitmire.  By the same token this definition and this
provision is not intended to nor does it invite or incent people to hire
people who are here illegally.  And if it did, if we got together as a
body and said you know what let's go ahead and let people in North
Carolina hire whoever they want, it's still a violation of federal law.
So if you have an employer who decides that they're going to take the
chance and hire somebody who is here illegally, then that's the risk
they run.  But it certainly won't be because they've gotten permission
to do so by us using the Department of Labor's definition of a seasonal
worker.  And I, again, suggest everybody and encourage everybody to vote
no on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Avila, rise?

as migratory workers, is there any kind of a review process or a
validation process or questionnaire that they have to be cleared for
inference or do they just walk in and start working? In terms of they're
accepted, they're vetted so to speak, in one area and that carries
through to following farms that they might go to work for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??, what I've learned during this
year-long process was that migratory workers can generally be people who
have come here on a work visa or they can be people who are American
citizens and they travel and I will share, it's just occurred to me, my
very first set of in-laws were farm workers.  They picked apples early
in their lives, early in their marriage, but people who are citizens as
Representative Whitmire said, he doesn't agree that there are people
here who would do those, and he's right. There are people who do that
for a living and they are migratory workers who follow the crop.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Burke,
Representative Blackwell rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I apologize for interrupting the debate
but could I ask to change my vote on House Bill 614 from yes to no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman's vote will be recorded as a no on House
Bill 614.  Is that the correct number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Pitt,
Representative Brown rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Cleveland would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Onslow yield to a question
from the gentleman from Pitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, Representative, could you for this body
please restate your opinion and analysis of the H2A Program as it
pertains to the 90 day window please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The H2A Program has nothing to do with the 90 day
window. If they come in under the H2A Program they're here and they work
here and they work here legally because they're in that program. Now the
people who use the H2A Program have to pay a better wage than the
migrant workers that are moving back but there's no restriction on the
time frame for a worker to my knowledge there's no restriction on the
time frame on the H2A worker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you would agree that the H2A Program is a better
model to be used particularly for agriculture?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry. Mr. Speaker I couldn't hear the first part
of his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could the gentleman from Pitt please restate his
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you agree that the H2A Program is a better model
to be utilized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I apologize.  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And does the gentleman yield to the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So in making this definition of seasonal workers more
modified to more outline what the Federal Government has done wouldn't
that further encourage the agricultural community to be able to utilize
the H2A Program, therefore creating a better model within North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.  I do not think that's the intent of what was done
nor would it make any difference to the people using the program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham,
Representative Jones, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Warren would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Rowan yield to the gentleman
from Rockingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hesitantly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Warren.  My question is if
this amendment were to pass and it would be a 90 day window is there
anything in the law that would prohibit an employer from being able to
hire this person as a seasonal temporary worker for 90 days and then
them not be hired for any period of time, whether it's one day or one
week, one month, one year, and then be rehired again. Would there be
anything in the law that would prohibit that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't believe there would be anything in the law
that would prohibit somebody from rehiring.  In fact I'm sure that
happens in the process.  The problem with that caveat in the original ??
law is that a Memorandum of Understanding is when you participate with a
?? you verify everybody.  Now the problem with that for seasonal workers
and why we have it in there is a job superintendent for a farm, a large
farm, might go pick up one day pick up 50 workers and the next day go
out and get 50 workers and have 35 different ones in that body. So it
becomes very onerous and almost, very difficult thing when you have a
migratory worker who might have worked with you one day and the next day
you've got 5 other people. So the whole process of calling them in in an
8 day period is unrealistic. So that's basically why it's there and the
reason for this superseding that is that you can't</p>

representative Dixon rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House and
representative Whitmire, I am a real farmer. I was on the farm working
this morning before I came to the session. When I leave I will go back
to the farm and continue my work there. I'm not interested in opening
the window you referred to or the possible window, but there is
something that I am intensely interested in keeping open. And that is
the doors to the supermarkets across this state and across this nation
from which we get our food. Much of which comes from situations that
we're discussion here today. At the appropriate time in this body I will
expand my thoughts concerning this. It's not appropriate at this time,
suffice it to say, I encourage you to vote against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on amendment two
sent forth by representative Cleveland? If not, the question before the
House is the adoption of the Cleveland amendment. So many as favor the
adoption of the amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the
court will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. 29 having voted in the affirmative and 82 in the negative, the
amendment fails. Representative Whitmire I just wanted to point out, I
noticed the gentleman when after the question had already been put so I
apologize, that's why you weren't called on to debate. For what purpose
does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth the
amendment and the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust moves to amend the bill on page
12, lines 44 through 46 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Guilford has the floor to debate
his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members, This amendment
would not have been necessary if representative Cleveland's had passed
so I held it off until we saw the vote on that. but basically the
purpose of this amendment is because in the definition of employee on
page 12 of the bill, the term does not include an individual whose term
of employment is customarily one, affected by the seasonality of the
industry in which the individual is employed, or is less than year round
and now that's been amended to less than 10 months. And because
seasonality is not clearly defined and can really be said to exist in
almost every single business, every business has some season in which
the business is stronger than others, many were of the opinion that this
definition the way it read completely eviscerates the e-verify because
an industry can just say, well we're seasonal so we don't have to abide
by it.
And I was gonna do six months changed the less than year round to six
months and I remember back in committee one after this past committee
talking to representative Collins explaining to me the actual operation
of the farms. I'd agreed with him to go to seven, then Monday talking
with the bill sponsor representative Warren, he had agreed with me on
nine. I know the amendment yesterday went to ten but that was a
comprehensive amendment so I didn't want to mess with amending an
amendment. So this amendment is very simple, it just defines the
exception for employee to be someone who works less than nine months out
of the year. I think it's important given how much we have seen...</p>

[Speaker Changes] The affordable care act business is starting to hire
their employees on a temporary basis or limiting their hours or limiting
their employment to get around the law, its something that businesses
look at doing. So I think to protect the verify system, we need to make
this ammenmend to the definition of employee.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentlemen from Rowan,
Representative Warren rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentlemen, Representative Blust is right,
when we spoke briefly here at this area actually the other day, we
agreed on nine months. Later though, when Representative Brown was
getting his amendment together, we took into consideration that there
are crops after September. We have a whole christmas tree industry in
Watauga, Ashe County, so Representative Brown decided on ten month, and
I said well I guess its semantics, I mean, nine months, ten months, I
don’t know if its worth tinkering with the bill for thirty days, but I
would just say to you, come see come solve, its your conscience, and I’m
not gonna get tore up over it one way or the other. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Onslow,
Representative Shepard rise?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir, Mr. Speaker, question for Representative
Dixon.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentlemen from Duplin yield to the gentleman
from Onslow?
[Speaker Changes] Yes Sir.
[Speaker Changes] He yields.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Dixon, as you know, Duplin County, many
of our counties, we have a lot of poultry and pork industry there. Would
this in any way be in confliction with the workers who work in those
industries? Or would they be considered nonseasonal since its usually
year round.
[Speaker Changes] The poultry or livestock industry would not be nearly
as affected as other types of agriculture, ie., vegetables, tobacco,
etc,.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins rise?
[Speaker Changes] Permission to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] I think, as I’ve mentioned before, we have some pretty
have some pretty big farm operations where I’m from. And they do a lot
of comprehensive farming, and the longest I know of any of them to keep
people is about seven months out of the year, and I believe if they
would move from my area to go do Christmas trees or whatever, I think
that period would start over again for them, wouldn’t it? So I’m fine
with this amendment, and encourage you to support it.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion? Further debate? If not, the
question before the house is Amendment 3 sent forth by Representative
Blust, to House Bill 786. So many as favor the adoption of the Blust

Further discussion? Further debate on the bill as amended? If not,
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston,
Representative Hastings rise?
[Speaker Changes] I guess Mr. Speaker, I need to ask one of the bill
sponsors a question.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentleman from Rowan yield to a question from
the gentleman from Gaston?
[Speaker Changes] Yes Sir.
[Speaker Changes] He yields.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Warren, this is a respectful and
friendly question. I realize I’m from a smaller community and not one of
the larger municipalities. But my district has about the same number of
people in it as everybody else’s, so I need to take some time and
clarify a couple of things here. In this bill, I see that the word
employee is mentioned and I’m not familiar enough with the federal law
to know, is an illegal alien who comes to work here illegible to be an
independent contractor, which would not be an employee?
[Speaker Changes] No sir.
[Speaker Changes] They’re not?
[Speaker Changes] It is against federal law to hire a person in the
state or in the country illegally. I will not..
[Speaker Changes] I believe someone has a telephone playing some sort of
song on. I would ask to please silence that. Look’s like its Larry Hall.
Anyway, for what purpose does the. Representative Hall, you seem like a
good person to blame for it. For what purpose does the gentleman Gaston,
Representative Hastings seek recognition, does the gentleman have an
additional question he would like to offer..
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentleman from Rowan yield?
[Speaker Changes] He yields.
[Speaker Changes] So would this allow someone to come to the United
States...</p>

states and work illegally [speaker changes]
No, sir. We have, North Carolina - No state has the authority to
legislate that. We do not have control over immigration laws. [speaker
changes]
Follow up [speaker changes]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question? [speaker changes]
Well, that's exactly where I was headed. If we believe in the supremacy
clause of hte US Constitution, and the law is already set out under
federal law as to how this would take place, why is it even necessary
that we do this bill? And it's a respectful question, I'm not badgering
you. If the law is already in place on the federal level, and we believe
- some might or might not - in the supremacy clause of the US
Constitution, why is it necessary? [speaker changes]
Are you talking about the entire bill, or this section 8? [speaker
changes]
Does the gentleman wish to further refine his question to the gentleman
from Rowan? You're recognized for that purpose, Representative Hastings.
[speaker changes]
Since the other parts are now a study, I guess we're focused on the part
at issue.  Is that correct? [speaker changes]
Follow-up [speaker changes]
I'm going along with you on this. I'm assuming [speaker changes]
So is there a federal law that covers this ?[speaker changes]
This pertains, Representative Hastings, this pertains to our North
Carolina's e-verify law. And the reason we're discussing it is because
the overall bill reclaimed North Carolina, gave us an opportunity to go
back and do two, no three things.  Number one, we had an opportunity to
go in and correct an oversight which would create a level playing field
for our state-based contractors requiring that any government entity,
municipality, county, state entity, that would do contracting work for
services or goods to send out an RFP. If our state-based contractors
were competing with an out-of-state contractor who is not required to
use e-verify, this will require our states not to do business with
anybody that is not compliant with North Carolina e-verify, to give our
contractors a level playing field. Another reason that we had the
e-verify in there was because part 9 of the bill, which established a
restricted drivers permit, it clearly establishes that permit holders
were here illegally. So we had a provision in there which was taken out
by yesterday's amendment that turned this into a study bill, that
directed the Commisssioner not to initiate proceedings against an
employer who did not e-verify someone who applied for a job with one of
these permits. The reason was because the permit already established the
fact that they were here illegally. It in no way, shape or form, though
it was misinterpreted to - and maybe that's semantics or the way it was
written or the way people reading it, some people interpreted it - it
did not authorize people to hire anybody having a permit. It simply
excused them from e-verify. The third thing was to take this opportunity
to do a technical correction on the definition of seasonal worker. So
all of this is not federal. It's a state bill. [Speaker changes]
One more follow-up [speaker changes]
Does the gentleman from Rowan yield to one last question from the
gentleman from Gaston? [speaker changes]
Yes, sir. [speaker changes]
And I apologize for being confused. Sincerely. Is there a federal law
that covers the provisions that you're trying to address in this bill.
[speaker changes]
No, sir [speaker changes]
There's not a federal law [speaker changes]
Not to my knowledge. [speaker changes]
Thank you sir. [speaker changes]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Pender, Representative Millis
rise? [speaker changes]
To discuss the bill in the light of clarifying some questions as a part
of the debate. [speaker changes]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [speaker changes]
In regard to the discussing the nature of this bill, simply germane to
the bill, in regarding Representative Hastings question, in the light of
that - we as a state due to the fact that the federal government has not
been responsible of enforcing its immigration laws. That it is in our
best interest to, as a state, to have our laws formed in a fashion that
is in the best interests of the citizens of North Carolina. Anything
that we do in this state regarding the issue of illegal immigration,
either encourages further illegal immigration or discourages further
illegal immigration. It's important on behalf of the citizens of the
state, for many reasons. One is because it has a direct impact to our
school systems. And it has a direct impact to our health care
facilities. Everything that we do here, due to the federal
irresponsibility of not enforcing the federal immigration laws, affects
the bottom line of the budget of this state and impacts the citizens of
North Carolina. So I say that in light of Representative Hastings
questions, in the light of the reasons why this is</p>

what we do here today and I just wanted to make those comments as a
clarifying nature of the intent of why this bill is before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Transylvania, Representative
Whitmire, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis's comments were very astute and, again, this
subject has got many pluses and many minuses. I wish we had a better way
to address the pluses, as Representative Dixon had addressed with the
farm community. Simply put, as far as making our state more attractive
to folks to come here and compete with folks who are looking for jobs,
and I know the criticisms will be some of those jobs you can't get
anybody to do. I do take issue with that to some degree but regardless,
we are making this to where we are making the folks that are trying to
put hard work back to work, who are here as residents and citizens,
they're competing against labor that will take a half or a third and
we're basically just worsening the problem and demoralizing our own
folks. And with that I hope that we can find a way to make this
discussion better in the future but for now I'll be opposing the bill.
Thank you.

I went home last night and when I go home at night sometimes I have to
be retrained the next day. So could you please explain to me, because
there seems to be some confusion, what exactly has been turned into a
study in this bill and particularly section 10. Is that a study or is
that still in the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. There are 11 sections, I think, if I remember correctly, in the
bill and all the sections, well actually 11th section retains dates of
implementation so there are ten provisions in the bill. All of them,
with the exception of section 8, has been turned into a study bill, sir.
All the law enforcement part. All the parts pertaining the creation of a
restricted drivers permit and restricted ID. The whole bill, sans the
part of section 8, is a study bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Ashe, Representative Jordan,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I'll be pretty brief here. A lot of the
questions have come up about, aren't there federal laws? Aren't there
things dealing with some of the things? Why are we doing what we're
doing? Representative Warren and I have talked with Representative
Brown, Representative Collins, why did we even get in the middle of this
at some point? The reason we are here is because the Federal Government
has left us hanging in the wind for decades on this issue. Something has
got to be done. We had a very finely crafted and balanced proposal to
try to deal with the very complicated and difficult issue of illegal
aliens of unlawful presence, the whole issue. We've done what we could.
Putting most of it into a study was required because if you pull one
little piece it's like that game Jenga. If you pull one little of the
wooden pieces out the whole thing falls apart. Then we have nothing. So
instead of just doing nothing and keeping our head stuck in the sand we
came up with a proposal and Representative Warren worked on it twice as
long as I have. We met with stakeholders from the entire range across
this issue. We need to do something, folks, and let me just read one
sentence from the United States Supreme Court to show you the trouble
that we're in unless we deal with this issue because Congress won't.
This is the Arizona case, the very recent Arizona case. Let me read you
one line in here and see if it sinks in, see what you think about it,
&quot;as a general rule it is not a crime for a removable alien to
remain present in the United States.&quot; That is the current federal
status. That's why we've got to do something here and we've got to do it
to protect our citizens. There are people</p>

Out there driving without insurance, without licenses. There are people
who are out there doing important work in our farms, in other
industries. I'm tired of doing nothing, I'm tired of sticking my head in
the sand. And if we can at least get this part of the e-verify to help
some of our agriculture and other interests. And study the rest of it
and come back and see if the insurance and safety, and other things,
are, we have to get some data on that. And I think we'll be in a better
position. But keep in mind, United States Supreme Court, as a general
rule, it's not a crime for a removable alien to reign present in United
States. I would urge you to please support this bill. And come back in

[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford,
Representative Hager rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. This bill was put forth by the
university folks, if you scroll down the title, pretty well it tells you
what the bill's about. You can scroll down through the items there and
look at what the universities are wanting to do. Most of those will be
in improvements in student halls, in student living, or an expansion of
those things. Very few other things are on there. Please vote green for
this. I think it's important to the universities for them to continue to
improve what they do for our students. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate? For what purpose does the gentleman from
Onslow, Representative Cleveland rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the
sponsor a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman sitting very
far away from the gentleman from Onslow yield to the gentleman's
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would love to as long as it doesn't have
anything to do with e-verify. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
Conditionally. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We could discuss that in private. In a
fast read here, I get the impression that all of these projects are
gonna be financed by bonds. Is that your understanding? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] As far as I understand Representative Cleveland. I'm not the
expert on this but as far as I understand that's true. Not by, not by,
the student fees also, I'm sorry I should have said that. I'm getting a
voice in my background, back here, back here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Onslow has the floor to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We do this every session. We pass a
bill to let the university system continue to expand. And we hear that
the university system needs a billion or more dollars for repairs. But
we still keep expanding. And the biggest part of this expansion that I
have aggravation with and heart burn, is the student fees that they use
to support a big part of it. We actually have some universities in this
state whose student fees rival the tuition we're charging. That's wrong.
And it's getting there because of expansion. And if we as a legislative
body don't pay attention to what's going on and been going on out there
for some time, and I've mentioned this before on this floor, we're not
doing for our constituents and our students what we should be doing.
This needs to be looked at, and it needs to be brought to a screeching
halt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from
Mecklenburg, Representative Brawley rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate

And they will be financed with bonds that will be paid by student fees.
And as the father of the undergraduate at UNC Charlotte and another
graduate at Western Carolina, I'm gonna be paying those. But, one of my
children sent me an email today and she's having problems getting
housing, there's just not enough. We can't put it off. They need a place

Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose do you rise the lady from
Orange, Representative Insko rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. If
you take a look at student fees they vary widely across all the
university campuses. And some of them do indeed seem to be out of step
with the others. Some seem to be too high. But this annual bill that we
have that comes through is really self liquidating. Not all these
students pay for these residence halls. The students who live there do,
the students who use the parking deck pay for the parking deck. So
they're very targeted fees, and not across the board fees and I urge you
to vote for the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentlemen from
Rutherford desire further comment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time
Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
bill a second time. Just real quick let's go to the piece that I most ??
with and look at the University of North Carolina Charlotte numbers
here. Now, when I went there which was not long ago. Maybe a little bit
longer. ?? Hall was old then. If you guys remember that's one of the
four quads that were there, that were originally built in the 60's I
believe. Oak Hall was built while I was there. And that's been many
years ago guys. For this particular example is not an expansion, but is
a renovation. It is to give those students a place to live. As
Representative of Raleigh was talking about, the one without hair. As
Representative ?? was talking, I have two students at NC state. And to
see, having to upgrade those dorms is much needed right now. In some of
what NC state is proposing is also some of the renovations. So this is
not an expansion ??, most of them are renovations if you look at them.
And they're much needed renovations for these kids to have good places
to stay. You wanna renovate to get the data in there, I don't know if
you guys have seen, have seen the kids, how they take tests now. They do
a lot of stuff online. A lot of these renovations will be to get the
data in there ?? get the data, to them, so they do their studies online,
do their homework online. Some of this is technology renovations as well
as housing renovations also within the housing. So please vote for the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Vance,
Representative Baskerville rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry to the Bill
Sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Rutherford yield to a
question gentleman from Vance? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I Do. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. When I first saw
this thing I noticed that it was a little over seven million dollars in
there about a track and a new residence dorm for Winston-Salem State
University, but that is not in this version of the bill. I was just
asking what happened to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That Winston State
University issue got taken out in finance. There is some issues involved
and some questions involved and I didn't take in that, the discussion,
the debate, I was there. But there may be someone else on the floor that
may have some other opinions on it. It was just taken out. The dorms
still in it but the track is not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Davidson, Representative
Brown rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the Bill Sponsor a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Rutherford yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the
Speaker is gonna owe me after this one I think. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
Representative, please explain section four to me if you would. The
first sentence in this bill, it says the Board of Directors may issue
subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, at one time, or
from time to time, special obligation bonds of the Board of Governors
for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of acquiring,
constructing or providing for the projects authorized in section two of
this act. Would this not be a violation of the bill that we passed
that's gonna limit the use of these special obligation funds until we
get them down to a certain percentage of the state total debt? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Brown. I'll have to say I don't know. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'd say that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? mention something. That is
that this bill will be on the calendar tomorrow. If members have some
questions that can wait until tomorrow that may be appropriate to do
that. This is a two day bill. Does the lady wish to propound an
additional question? Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't really have a
question, I just wanted to have a follow up comment. If that indeed does
really negate what we passed a month or so ago, I would have really
serious.</p>

regards to Section 2 that deals with terminal ???????, which I will
speak on real briefly here at the beginning.  And we actually further
clarify and truly define the definition of terminal ????? to make sure
that it's not construed in any way, shape or form as a jetty.  We also
further clarify and remove some obstacles for the four terminal ?????

was impossible for these terminal ???? to be built but we've done so in

does the gentlemen from New Hannover  Rep Catlen rise
[Speaker Changes] To Debate the bill
[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen has the floor to debate the bill
[Speaker Changes] Thank you. I very much appreciate all the hard work
that Rep Millis has put in to it and I urge your support. Just to give
you a little bit of a back ground for years and years since the federal
government built the inert coastal waterways, they have funded the
maintenance of the hamlets and they have also funded a lot of our beach
re nourishment. The inter coastal waterways add a lot of energy to the
water that flows in and out of the hamlets. The federal government no
longer maintains their agreement to fund these projects. Since the
federal government doesn’t fund these projects, the state government
doesn’t give matching dollars because local money is not as gold as
federal money and So the burden on maintaining these hamlets is pretty
much on the back of the local government and they are very important to
our economy. They are important to our fishing industry . And they are
very important to our recreational economy. so we need to do some thing.
So there is need for a tool. And North Carolina is one the few places
that is  over the years  banned the use of such tools. And I understand
that. I have worked very hard over the last 20 years to move sand around
in a friendly way. But there is no money any more. So this bill keeps
the pilot program employed and it  does make it possible and I want to
move the four terminal groins forward
I want to clarify and I said this drawing up yesterday.
Just like every body knows what we are really talking about. Just see
that a circle with a line is the groin field. That’s what a lot of think
 we are talking about here and that’s what they do in New Jersey. And it
doesn’t work very well and it’s dangerous and its ugly .The next line
circle with a line is what a jetty truly is. People have misquoted the
terminal groin issues as jetties quite a bit. Jetties do block sand
movement. They are there to stabilize navigation channels. When you
build a jetty you have to put [??] money in place to move the sand from
one side to another because it will starve the downstream beaches.
Terminal groins are built to the edge of the sand and they do not block
the movement of the sand in water and they are pre-filled with beach
quality sand. What they basically do is stop erosion from an inlet which
is moving back and forth due to inter coastal waterways. It’s a they are
not jetties. They are only constructed at the beach terminus or the end
of the beach and they do not stop sand movement. So there was a lot of
misunderstanding in the past on this issue and so one of the things that
we worked on together is a truly clarify the definition and that’s the
reason I sent out this such a  pretty drawing. Anyway, I request you
support for this bill please
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the lady  from Gilford, rep
Harrison rise.
[Speaker Changes] To send forth an amendment
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
clerk will read
[Speaker Changes] Rep Harrison moves to amend the bill on page 3 line 40
by rewriting the line to read  the inlet
[Speaker Changes] The lady from Gilford has the floor to explain the
amendment
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chair. Ladies and gentlemen of the house.
This amendment will remove the language on page 3 line 40 that says the
inlet manager plant is not required to manage the sea level rise. We had
a healthy debate regarding the sea level rise in this chamber last year.
North Carolina is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. With more
than 5000 miles of ocean front  with estranged shore line and we and
much of it is low lying. and there is the U.S. Geological survey study
that came out last June indicated that we are in a  Sea level rise hot
spot north of cape caterers where our sea level has been rising 3 to 4
times the global rate. And this fall there was another study from
environmental research letter that indicates that the sea level rise
appears to be rising.</p>

faster than previously anticipated, so I think we’re in for a big
problem if we are constructing these items and not factoring in the sea
level rise aspect, and I would just urge your support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover,
Representative Catlin rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The sea level rise issue is very controversial, and
it’s very difficult to get into as part of this amendment. I would say
that if sea level is rising, the worst thing that would happen is it
would cover up the beach and cover up the terminal groin, so I don’t
know where that would have any impact, but as a… I’m a coastal engineer
and a coastal geologist, and when we deal with sea level rise, we try to
take the historic trend, which is basically about a dime thickness every
year. So there are predictions out there that have done modeling that
predict a lot faster sea level rise, but we can’t even predict where our
hurricane’s going with thousands of educated people and computer
programs, so to add this provision would basically put the terminal
groin pilot program back in a dead zone because there is no way to
calculate that sea level rise and how to do that in your early
management program. So I strongly urge that you vote no to this
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on this
amendment. If not, the question before the house is the passage of
amendment number 2, sent forth by Representative Harrison. So many as
favor the adoption of the amendment will vote aye. Those opposed will
vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine
and record the vote. 40 having voted in the affirmative and 73 in the
negative, the amendment fails. We’re now back on the main question.
Further discussion, further debate? For what purpose does the lady from
Guilford, Representative Harrison rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
I really appreciate Representative Catlin and everyone else’s work on
this bill because what the Senate sent over was really problematic, and
I think that they’ve done a really good job of trying to refine it and
limit the impact of the bill, but I’m afraid there’s still a problem. I
don’t know that this is a good idea for us to be hoarding up our
shorelines. It was a good policy we put in place in 1985. We established
this very carefully crafted four project pilot project legislation last
session that we all approved in Senate Bill 110. What this bill does is
it rolls back many of the provisions that were put in place to protect
the taxpayer and the environment, and I think that there’s a chance we
could be committing taxpayers to future mitigation costs that far exceed
the construction costs of these groins, and I think that it seems like
the language also allows for multiple jetties at – or excuse me,
terminal groins, at these locations. So I would urge the members to vote
no on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Pender, Representative Millis rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask
Representative Harrison a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady from
Guilford yield to a question from the gentleman from Pender? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the
light of your debate in regard to removing taxpayer protections, on page
4 of the bill, beginning in line 42 and ending in line 48, is it clear
to you that in no way, shape or form does this loosen the taxpayer
protections, but further strengthens it by saying flat out that a local
government may not use these funds? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I appreciate
your pointing that out. I guess some who’ve looked at this language and
interpreted it are concerned that perhaps the mitigation cost may not be
factored into this, so I understand those can be far more expensive than
the construction costs. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow-up
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield to an additional
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I’m sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On page 4, in regards to not covering the
costs for mitigation, beginning in line 1 all the way down to line 13,
is it clear that the financial insurance, whoever constructs these four
terminal groins for this state for us to see how the project pilot goes
and for us to evaluate the effectiveness of it, that it includes
long-term maintenance and monitoring, that it includes mitigation
measures tied directly to the inlet management plan, and it also covers
the cost of the mitigation or removal of the terminal groin if it
doesn’t comply with the stats of the inlet management plan? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I appreciate you raising that. I guess there’s just difference
of interpretation, but thank you, and I do appreciate your</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I would ask you to
support Senate Bill 223. This bill was introduced by Senator Hise and
it's primarily in response to LME's across the State. As many of you
know in our mental health system, that's a very complex, constantly
changing world that they live in. And it's been quite difficult,
especially in the western part of the State, to obtain the proper
leadership needed because of some restrictions on the ability to pay, to
offer benefits and to do other things. Pay for the relocation and
severance benefits. So that's the purpose of this bill. It's to help our
mental health system work more efficiently and give our local LME's the
ability to retain and attract the best folks possible. I'd be happy to
answer any questions you may have. This does not require an additional
appropriation. It will be funded through the LME per capitated rate that
consumers would be charged. So I commend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of Senate Bill 223 on its
second reading. So many as favors passage of the bill will vote aye,

to help improve the ability to collect property taxes on automobiles.
The idea was to use the tag agents as the agents to collect the property
tax.  The bill that you have before you deals with what fee or what
percentage will need to be paid to the collectors of that tax. It does a
few things, the first part section 1 sets up an advisory committee which
will work, this is something frankly that we have needed for a long
time, it will work with the DMV and with the private license plate
advisory committee to study various things including how much the fee
that we're about to discuss should be. This bill also creates a new
concept called a T sticker what this means is that you know some of our
car dealers now do the tags themselves they were not particularly
comfortable with the collection of the property tax as a part of what
they do so they can issue this new T sticker and then the actual LPAs,
or License Plate Agencies, would administer would collect the full
property tax that was due and also the charge for the plate.  I'd  like
to share a little bit of information with you in the interest of full
disclosure.  I know from the finance committee meeting that some of our
counties have expressed some concern with this bill.  I asked and have
received from our fiscal staff what the costs to the counties would be
based on this bill that you have before you and the answer is the cost
is $3, 463, 476.00 which is a lot.  But then I asked what do the
counties gain for this? Currently the collection rate for property tax
on automobiles is at 86%.  Under this new system where the person can't
get a tag unless they pay their property tax our staff estimates and
common sense I think would tell you that that number will go to nearly
100%  So what does that mean? That means a gain of $72 million.  So I
think that more than offsets the cost.  I'll be glad to get as in depth
with this bill as the members want me to.  I can tell you since this
program was since this bill was passed creating this concept in 2005
folks have known this was out there finally the DMV has begun to work
with the LPA's and to get them set up to be able to provide this very
valuable service to the counties.  And frankly it's a service that I
think the citizens appreciate they enjoy the one stop shop if you will
to do all their tax and tags business at the same place.  So with that I
would respectfully ask for your support. I send it both 305. Thank you
Mr. Speaker.  [SPEAKER CHANGE]. For what purpose does the lady from
Surrey Representative Stevens rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady has the floor to debate the
bill.[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the
House I'm gonna ask you to vote against this bill.  I filed a bill at
the beginning of this session to try to stop this program.  I recognize
what Representative Lewis says about how it is gonna increase and
improve collections but let me tell you how bad it has already been on
the county.  My county alone now has triple the costs of trying send out
its tax bills and do collection.  There was a better way to do this
program and nobody......</p>

<p id="170:00">
...can tell me why we didn't do it that way? OK? This one was going to
be &quot;Let's send out a common bill.&quot; No problem. I have no
problem with that, saving the efficiencies, but instead here's the
system they came up with: &quot;Counties send your tax information to
the Department of Motor Vehicles, because we know they're so efficient,
send your information up there. Let them send a single combined bill but
oh, by the way county, you get to pay for the entire bill. You pay for
the mailing cost. You pay the state to send out your bill.&quot;
Then the bill goes to the citizen. The citizen's supposed to go to the
license plate agency and pay both the tax and the bill, their renewal
bill. All well and good but the county gets to pay for that too. The
license plate agency gets to add a fee and take it out of that money
before they send it back to the county. Then the money turns around and
goes to the state who again processes it and takes a fee and then sends
its money to the county. This is a new fee on top of all that I just
announced to you.
My county is outraged. Several counties were outraged. Why couldn't we
do it like we do inspections? That's the question I've never been able
to get answered by anybody here. Why couldn't we have the state send the
information to the county? Let the county do a single bill and then when
you pay your taxes, they do a check, just like they do at inspection
stations, and you get your license. They would still be collecting 100
percent. They wouldn't have triple the cost of collection, and now add
another $0.71 per bill on top of that.
So Representative Lewis was giving you the party line on that that we're
only collecting 86 percent and this one I'll collect is 100 percent, but
that was what they were promised before it even went here. This is
tripling the cost on our county and it's an unfunded mandate and I would
ask that you vote against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Stevens...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just wondered if Representative Stevens would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Surry yield to the gentleman from Nash?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm asking you this question because I am trying to understand this
issue? I don't understand everything about what you just said about the
two different processes. What I am trying to understand is this: I've
been getting those riot letters from somebody in my county office and as
I read all of them together, the second email she sent me, they were
complaining about the fact that these extra bills, as you were talking
about, was going to cost the counties in North Carolina $4.8 million
over the next 18 months, were her exact words. Then the next $4.8
million over 18 months. So that's $3.5 million dollars a year basically.
Anyway, the next email she sent me said that with the extra collections
that the counties were going to give them additional $45-50 million per
year. So my email response to her was, &quot;Are you seriously
complaining to me that it's going to cost $4.8 million over 18 months to
get an additional $50 million? Where is the complaint? I just don't
understand it?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to respond to the gentleman's question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'm assuming that your call came from a license plate agency.
That's from the county itself. OK. My county says, &quot;We currently
collect 90-95 percent of our bills. We don't collect them all at the
same time. You have to figure it out throughout the year.&quot; They're
saying, &quot;We collect 90 percent of our bills without this and now
we're going to pay triple the cost to do it, to get it out there.&quot;
Now, the system that I said, and that's what I propose to bill and then
have a substitute ready to put it in, would have changed this system
where the counties could've decided how they were going to spend their
money on collection and simply have the license plate agency have a box
check, just like you do for inspections. So it would've saved them
money. Now, the money they're talking about, this $3.5 million, that's
new money on top of the triple cost of sending out the Bill.
My county has a private agency that it uses that cost about $0.75 to do
a bill. The state's going to charge them about $1.25. The county
collects its own money, still has the same number of people hired, and
the license plate agency's going to charge them $0.71 per bill or $1.27
per bill to collect the money. Then it goes back to the state who's
going to charge another fee to turn around and separate out the money
and send it back to the county.
This bill adds another either $0.71 or $1.27 to that expense per bill,
per bill. It created more layers of government than we have when this
was an attempt to consolidate a billing and make it a more simplified
process. We've gone about as convoluted as we can, and I'm just asking
you not to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose...</p>

[Speaker changes.]...does the gentleman from Craven, Representative
Speciale rise?
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] I don't fully understand all this myself so what I'd
like to do...I'm gonna read something that I received from the tax
administrator in one of my counties that just take a minute to do that
and maybe somebody can explain to me...maybe the sponsor can explain it
or whatever cause I don't really fully get it. Just so you know he's a
tax administrator and also on the North Carolina Association of
Assessing Officers...said &quot;this bill among other things provides
for a fee increase to the license plate agencies for collecting fees due
under the new tag and tax together process...or tax and tag together.
Under the current lobby, the LPA's receive forty-eight cents per
transaction from the cities and counties for collecting property tax
under this new process. This bill proposes to raise that amount to $1.06
initially and then drop it to seventy-one cents.  We have not seen any
evidence that the existing fee of forty-eight cents is insufficient.
Further I don't believe that anyone has provided any rationale for why
the fee should be $1.06 and then drop to $.71. The collection fee is
taken from local property tax revenue so that the local governments will
hafta' pay this increase if the bill is enacted into law. We cannot see
any justification  for this.  The LPA's have nothing to do with
determining the amount due nor do they have anything to do with the
distribution of the proceeds collected. They have no additional duties
involved in this new tax and tag program. The only possible additional
requirement that I can see is the size of the bank deposit bag and
usually the bank provides those. Another point, and perhaps more
troubling, is...then the fee increase is that it appears that as 305, it
sets up an LPA Advisory Board as a quasi-governmental board, at taxpayer
expense, in support of contractors who enter into service agreements,
for profit, with another state agency, the DMV.  This makes no sense to
me.&quot; I would ask that you not support this bill and so, if anybody
can explain...counter this, I'd like to hear it.  I'm gonna ask that you
not support it.
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the gentleman from Rowan,
Representative Ford, rise?
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] I ask that you vote against this bill. I've heard
from my county commissioners, they're opposed to it, said it will cost
them a minimum of a quarter million dollars more a year. A minimum of a
quarter million, probably more. And ???? local tag office, if they get
aggravated because now they're collecting taxes and people that are
paying taxes are not usually happy to begin with...if they get
aggravated and they cease operations and go into some other
business..and most of them have other businesses that sell tags, then
the county may get stuck with selling the tags. It's already happened in
some parts of North Carolina.  So I ask that you oppose this bill.
We're already collecting in our county 86 to 92 percent and most...MOST
of the ones that are not collected are the ones that are 8 to 10, 12
dollars.  It does add up but...this will cost my county more and I ask
that you oppose this bill.
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the lady from Orange,
Representative Insko, rise?
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker and Members. What I'm
hearing from speakers are concerns about the process, not about the
concept so I do think that we need to...probably take time to contact
our County Commissioners but the concept is a good concept, it will
bring in alot more money. It will...people owe this money. We ought to
be collecting it. We may need to tinker with this a little bit but the
concept is a good idea and I urge you to vote for the bill and we can
object a third and get more information.
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick,
Representative Iler rise?
[Speaker changes.] To ask the bill presenter a question.
[Speaker changes.] Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the
gentleman from Brunswick?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, Mister Speaker.
[Speaker changes.] He yields.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, if I understand and I have had
conversations about this quite a while and my county thinks it's a great
idea.  They're gonna gain from this because of additional collections.
I've had conversations with certain people about their counties opting
out at some point. Wasn't this bill..wasn't this process set up, as you
mentioned I believe...several years ago...and isn't this just about the
fee...this bill??
[Speaker changes.] Thank you for that, Representative and let me begin
by saying that's a great looking suit that you're wearing today.  Yes,
this process began in 2005. It's been out there, it's been out there,
it's been out there.  Some of the concern that you've heard on the floor
today...frankly it's

probably a valid concern about the way the program was setup. The point
of this bill, though, has to do with the fact that we as a state have
mandated these privately owned license plate agencies to perform a
service and we have to compensate them for that. So this establishes
what that compensation is.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Ashe, Representative Jordan,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the gentleman from Ashe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you representative Lewis. You talked about
approximately 3.5 million dollars of cost to collect approximately 70

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It seems reasonable to me, and I would ask the question of you, would it
not be reasonable that these transaction and collection costs should be
applied to the delinquent taxpayers as opposed to coming from the gross
receipts of the counties who are already owed this tax money and it is
not actually new money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative, I think that would make sense. Obviously if it's a
delinquent taxpayer you've got two or three issues involved. One, you
may never collect the tax so it's a net loss. Two, the fact that the
taxes are collected at the same time the [??] issued there's no lag in
the receipt of the tax money to the counties. I've looked at this and it
just seems to me that if we're going require this, and we are, it's law,
we're going to require this, in fact you may have even seen it
advertised in your local newspaper, the tax and tag thing, if we're
going to require this private businesses to do then we're going to have
to compensate them for that. And so I see your point, and as always, is
a very astute point but I would still ask you to support the bill on the
grounds that we're mandating what these private businesses do and we
need to compensate them for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Randolph, Representative
McNeill, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very interesting discussion. I got an email from one of my county
commissioners earlier last week very, very much opposed to this bill.
Very opposed to it. Didn't want to see it happen, wanted me to vote
against it. Last Friday at 3:00, myself and that commissioner went to
our local tag office and we sat down with a lady that run the tag office
and we had a discussion. She showed us everything on the computer that
would be going on, how the process would work, and we had a very good
long discussion. We were there probably an hour and a half. At the end
of that discussion the commissioner was not as opposed to it as he had
been when the first conversation started. We have since had some,
Representative Hurley and I, have since had some other discussion with
some other county commissioners but at this point I think it is a good
deal for the counties. One point that I made to my commissioner, and I
probably shouldn't say this in open discussion, but the local tax
departments at the county will be doing a lot less work now and they
could actually save some money there by laying some people off and
that's unfortunate to have to say that but if they're not there and
they're not collecting these taxes maybe their services are not needed.
So the county could save some other money that way. It's not a perfect
bill, I understand, but I think in the long run with the percentage rate
of money that's collected and going up I think it's probably a good deal
for the counties so I think you should support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Randolph, Representative Hurley,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Lewis a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the lady from Randolph?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, if we vote against this bill today is that going
to stop the program that's already begun since 2005 that we've been
planning?</p>

<p id="185:00">
with everything in place?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That's a very, very good question.  The short answer
is no. It's going to move forward.  The question that you have to ask
yourself as you contemplate that response though is if in fact we're
going to compensate these private businesses at a rate that they say is
not sustainable for them to perform the work, are we going to either a)
relieve them from having to do this or b) and I know this sounds like an
exaggeration but as somebody who's had the privilege to sit on the
Program Evaluation Committee for seven years now and I've watched the
work that they've done on these LPA's and they've praised how efficient
they are and what a good job they do and they really are at a break-even
point now and I'm concerned frankly if we do not adequately compensate
them their choice may be to lock the door.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you know how much the State has already spent in
getting all these places ready for  this program and they've already put
in everything that they need for this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, thank you for that. I don't know the
exact amount.  I can request staff with the permission of the Speaker to
get that.  I can tell you that like everything there seems to be a small
hitch.  Whenever we try to do something, I know that a week or two ago
when the main State-run DMV Office attempted to begin accepting credit
cards it actually wound up shutting down the whole office for the day.
Everything went off line. So there are some challenges in place but the
State has to your point invested quite a bit, spent quite a bit, to get
this program up and going and it is going to go into effect regardless
the outcome of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I please debate the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady from Randolph is recognized to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It appoints an advisory committee in here which I'm
sure will be working with the counties and with the Tag offices.  I
think as you heard this bill is not going to stop it.  It's just going
to try to figure out an amount that's going to be paid, whether the
county, if they do collect a lot, and the tag offices do need to be
compensated for their work and it is going to take some work off of the
county tax office and it has put a lot of work on our Tag offices but
they are all set up now to do this and I thought it was supposed to go
on line on July the 1st.  So I think we should vote for this and if we
have to come back and address the amount that we pay, whichever way and
however it works, I'm sure we can do that.  Thank you.

[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston,
Representative Daughtry arise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
T[Speaker Changes] he gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. The
house will come to order.
[Speaker Changes] Members, particularly you members that are new here,
this is a bill that has a lot of different parts. Most of the parts
you've heard before either in committee or on the floor. The first part
of this bill has to do with the medical services  provided by the county
for prisoners who are serving in the jails in the various counties.
Presently the counties pay the hospitals the full amount for the cost of
medical services. This bill would simply allow the counties to pay the
same rate that the State pays when they have prisoners that get sick and
take them to the hospital. And that is 70% of the cost of the entire
bill. If its medicaid its two times medicaid. And I think my
understanding is that there has been an agreement worked out between the
county commissioners and the hospitals regarding this bill.  There is
some question as to the definition of being in custody, and I don't want
to get into that part of the bill. I think somebody may have an
amendment about that but I'm not sure. The second part of this bill is
regarding District Court Judges and how they should be appointed  if one
were to resign or die while he or she was in office. Presently the
Governor selects those people who resign or die in office. For those
judges in the ?? Courts as well as the Superior Courts, at the
district...</p>

...the court level, the way the law has always been. The judicial
district, the lawyers would meet and by secret ballot, they would select
three names and they would be submitted to the Governor and the Governor
was required to select one of the three names. This bill is a compromise
that would allow the Governor to select whoever he wanted but the county
bar, the judicial bar, would send five names and recommend strongly that
the Governor select one of those five, but he would not have to select
one of those five.
The other part of the bill regards the Register of Deeds. It's a bill
that I ran some time ago. It was a compromise bill where the Secretary
of State would keep a record of when the Register of Deeds would be
available, would be open during the week for business. It was done at
the request of the State Bar, the Real Property Section of the State Bar
to make sure that you could close loans and file papers in a consistent
manner.
And Mr. Speaker, I'd like to send forth an amendment at this time.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I agree with you. I share that concern, but it's
tied to the passage of House Bill 94 and it doesn't look like that's

<p id="200:00">
The bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, and while I agree with large portions of the
bill, and particularly the first part as it relates to counties, as long
as that stays intact, but we'll see how long that stays intact, Ii have
continuing concerns and can't vote for the bill because of the provision
that deals with the judges.  This goes back to the debate we had on the
floor some time ago, maybe about 2 weeks ago now, and I'll set out why,
although I thank Representative Daughtry, because I think that this is
at least an integral work of improvement, given what was sent over.  The
district judges in vacancies are now chosen by a really good process, as
best you can get in a political environment.  And that is, that when
there's a vacancy, the bar meets, and that county chooses 3 nominees,
sends them to the Governor, the Governor must pick 1 of those 3
nominees.  Essentially, allowing the community to have the input as to
who's going to a judge that they elected, and to have the bar have input
into the merit, and create some sense of merit selection in the process.
 This bill takes that out, and says that now the bar sends up 5
nominees, which is as fine as 3, but the Governor has to look at them,
but then can throw them in the trash can.  The Governor never has to
pick 1 of those 5, and can still go pick their own.  As I suggested, I'm
opposed to this when there was some discussion of this kind of process
when Mike Easley was Governor, and it never came to be when Beverly
Perdue was Governor, and I'm opposed now, and it doesn't matter who the
Governor is.  Judges ought to be to the best they can given the
environment in which they operate, and we operate as much as we can,
giving some merit selection review to the bar, and the people of their
county.  After all, they're replacing someone who's elected by people in
that county.  And it ought not be based on who's the friend of the
Governor, or who made contributions, or all the other things we know
would go in, if we have with any governor, unrestricted capacity, and I
think that's wrong in judicial decisions.  It ought to be that the local
bar has to send in 5 nominees is fine, I think it's actually better than
3.  But at some point, when you're giving the Governor that many, there
ought to be 1 that the Governor has to pick as a replacement.  And if
the population for some reason doesn't like that, or the political
parties don't like that, well in a couple of years, or a year, that
position is going to come up for election.  But it is simply wrong to
take the remaining sort of integrity out of the process.  What ever
merit selection we have, and simply turn it over, and say to the local
community, you've gone through all this trouble of holding a bar
meeting, nominating folks, looking at their records and then, But yeah,
but doesn't matter, we're just kidding. We're going to select our own
person anyway.  And I think that really disses the local bar, and really
takes out the little bit of merit selection we have in the process.  And
so, for that reason, because of that, I'm really opposed, and also
frustrated again by process here.  And again, this is not Representative
Daughtry, who does a great job, but you know, Representative Stevens did
a really good thing when this came up.  And, as I recall the matter was
re-referred, or referred to judiciary.  Well, it went there, but the
judiciary committee never met to talk about it.  So, if we're going to
refer a bill to the  judiciary, we ought to at least have a meeting, in
order to figure it out.  We didn't.    And if the judiciary committee's
not going to meet, and talk about a topic that involves the selection of
the judiciary,  why have a judiciary committee.  And so, for those
reasons I am opposed to the bill, and I'm sorry it's included in other
provisions that are good provisions, or at least they are until they get
amended out, and I'm going to vote no.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Union,

question.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]So do I.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]My question is, regarding, and you accurately touched
on the very point that I'm in favor of this, but I wanted to get your
thoughts on the fact that, because these judges are originally selected
by the people, and when there's a vacancy, we are in a sense.</p>

<p id="205:00">
In our judgement, for those people until the next election.  Give me
your thoughts on the fact that the Governor is an elected body, versus
the bar not being a body, so that you have that separation of power, and
you have some type of response of an elected official being responsible
for these.
I think that's a good question, and I'll try to, Representative, give
you my best response.  My thought is, it's the local people  who elected
that judge.  It is the local bar who has the sense, the best sense,
certainly we don't know in Raleigh, what lawyers are doing their job in
that county, how they've performed in court, are they at the court, are
they responsive to their clients, do they understand multiple areas of
the law.  Because judges can't be just a criminal specialist anymore, or
civil specialist.  And there's no way to really get that.  The people
who have the best sense of that are all of the entire bar in an area.
Now, I recognize that it gives us much more to work with in the wake, or
mech. bars, because there's a lot more people to see and choose from, an
a little less so in rural areas.  But in some sense, it's even better in
rural areas because they really do know everybody in their bar.  And
they really do have a sense.  And I sense is, the 3 nominees that go up
from the bar, you can always end up with a political appointment in a
sense that the bar's sending up their favorite fellow or woman, but the
bar really does try to get it right.  They don't generally as a whole,
send up 3 nominees who don't have those qualities that they think they
would want appear in a judge. Fairness, and deliberateness, and
thoughtfulness.  And I think I would rather judge, and have the local
community with that input, put their successor in for the short time,
than the Governor.  And as I suggested, it doesn't merit to me who the
party the Governor is, and I've seen in all of us who have been here a
little while have seen that process, and how it works, and when it can
be somewhat unrestricted.  And as matter of fact, let's just be clear in
a different matter, there was a lot of consternation on the other side
of the island, maybe rightly so about last minuet judicial appointments
by the outgoing Governor, that may or may not, in some people's minds,
have be made fully on merit, because there was not real check on that.
I view the bar process as a check and a balance, and some merit in what
is otherwise a very political process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For why, does the gentleman wish to prepare a 2nd
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman from Cumberland yield to said
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do you not think, that the way it's worded now,
provides the proper balance of that input regarding the local germane
situation, I do understand that, with the balance of the elected
accountability.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No, and here's my reason why, Representative.  I'm
perfectly great with the change from 3 to 5, and if this said that the
Governor had to choose 1 of the 5, I'm with you.  But it says the
Governor can just ignore all 5.  So we could put in that the bar
nominates 10, but if the Governor doesn't have to choose 1 of those 10,
what good's the process.  Now we hope the Governor would restrict him or
herself to those 5, but there's absolutely nothing in there that
requires that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]What purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Lucas rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, this
bill is identical, the original version, the Senate version of this
bill, is original to a bill that I initially filed the House this
session.  And it dealt strictly with inmate costs.  And how we wanted
the local folk to have the same level of compensation as the State.
That was my intention of the bill.  As the bill that's come back now, I
don't even recognize to my original bill.  I don't recognize this bill.
We had no inquiry about our speculation or input about this bill, and
I'm sure that Representative Daughtry is doing his very best to clean up
this bill, and I respect him for that.  I have high respect for
representative Daughtry.  But this bill now represents some version of
Prego of Heinz 57,  It's got too much in it.  It's all in there.
Judges, registered deeds, and some of that's good.  But these are all
stand alone bills, some of them we've already voted on, and.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover represent ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker to comment on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman have afforded to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker remember that the house win ?? section 4 first came to light
was in government community and it was an individual bill which at that
time only contained 4 senates.And that is a vacancy in the office of
district court judge it'll be filled for the unexpired term by the
appointment of the Governor and that was it.And at that time, being an
attorney, knowing very well the process that have been taking place, I
went to the bill sponsors and said I can't live personally with not
allowing input from the local board. Because that is how it has been for
years, even though we may not be saying that Government is bound by that
nomination. I still think we need to put it in there that the local
board does have input because I think it's important for the lawyers and
the local board to have some input for the Judges they will be going
before with their cases. And the sponsors agreed to that. And that
amendment was added in the committee. Now that it has come back, it has
changed a bit meat and potato kind of guy, like to hit nail on the head.
The way I see this if you want to lame the governor and tie his hands to
whom he can appoint to fill in the blanks, you can vote against the
bill.  Because the system we now have, where the board will nominate the
three appointees that the Governor has to choose from for a man in
effect. If you want to give the Governor the leverage to choose whomever
he thinks might be the best person for that position and not be bound by
the recommendations of the local board, then you vote for the bill. But
at least, either way I'm glad we still have language that would allow
input from the local board because I think that is very important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose the gentleman from Wake represent the ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman have afforded to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr.Speaker.
The gentleman from New Hanover with regards have framed the issue
exactly as it is.And you can use that for the vote accordingly. I am
happy that there is at least provision which allows the local board to
provide input but as the gentleman from Cumberland said in his debate
that there is absolutely no requirement for the Governor to look at it
or even consider it. He can go straight in the round ?? cabinet as they
say. And this for those of you who have successfully like the gentleman
from union avoided interaction with the legal system, this may not sound
that important. But it is because in the end the quality of our judicial
system relies on the quality of our judges.And we important that we have
a system of checks and balances. And that's what we learn about our
government from fourth grade onwards. Checks and balances, I think there
may have even been a cartoon about that on Saturday morning cartoons,
right after how a bill becomes a law. But checks and balances and
important. The system we have now is not perfect and in fact pulls in a
body outside of Government, the local board, to play a part in this
system. It's not perfect but it does serve as a meaningful check on the
power of the Governor.I know our current Governor is going to get good
advice from his counselor whom I used to practice law with. Governor
Perdue got good advice from her counselor, Governor Easley got good
advice from his counselor. They are going to stir him to make the right
choice. But I don't know that I trust that for future governors even at
the federal level. And I hate to say that the feds are doing something
better than we are but there are meaningful checks there. The President
for federal judges is required to get the opinion of lawyers. He can
pick whoever he/she wants to. But remember, that's with the advise and
consent of the senate. An extremely meaningful check on the which would
other wise be unfettered power of the President. I don't think we at
Legislature want to get in in the business of Judicial confirmations. We
already got enough on our plate right now. In absence of that, I think
it's absolutely crucial to have a meaningful check on the power of the
Governor in appointing judges and because of that unless that ?? we
change in the bill, I am gonna have to vote Against.</p>

For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Floyd rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, when I first saw this bill I was really
impressed, like my colleagues from Cumberland County. I say it was a
bill that I would support because my county had asked us to try to
recoup some of this medical cost. And then on the other end of that my
registered ?? opposed the bill because of what impact it would have on
the registered deed office. So then I walked around, I threw up my hand,
what do I do? I'm confused because the bill may be confused with the add
on and the registered deeds in the county Board of Commissioners. And so
to me, the bill started off as being good and then it started off like a
hamburger. So I'm lost now, Mr. Speaker. So if some of the changes could
be made in the bill I think it's a good bill. As Representative Glazier
mentioned, you can send up five but I don't have to ?? any one of the
five, so why send up the five? I'm not obligated to select any of the
five, so the bill itself has become too complex. And at this particular
point in time, I cannot support that because the register of deed going
to be upset if I support it on that end. The county Board of
Commissioners going to be upset because I didn't get their costs and I
compromised with it. So right now, I can't support the bill in its
present form.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 321 on its second reading. So many as favor
the passage of the bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The
Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. Seventy having
voted in the affirmative and thirty-nine in the negative. House
Committee Substitute 3 for Senate Bill 321 passes on its second reading
and will remain on the calendar.
Senate Bill 341, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 341, a bill
to be entitled An Act to Establish an Expedited Process for the
Modification of Inter-Basin Transfer Certificates and For Issuance of
Inter-Basin Transfer Certificates in the Central Coastal Plain Capacity
Use Area and the Coastal Area Counties, and to Amend SL 2013-50, An Act
to Promote the Provision of Regional Water and Sewer Services by
Transferring Ownership and Operations of Certain Public Water and Sewer
Systems, to Make a ?? Water and Sewer District. General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston,
Representative Daughtry rise? For what purpose does the gentleman from
Pender, Representative Millis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Out of respect to Representative Floyd, I will debate
this very briefly. The bill does exactly what the bill's summary, it
actually discusses and it also does as exactly what the short title
explains. This is regards to permitting, in regard to inter-basin
transfers. It is only, actually, the language is specifically aimed at
streamlining the process and making it more affordable. Roughly it costs
about $5 million and about on average of five years or more to actually
complete an inter-basin transfer permit, whether a new one or an actual
modification. This will actually provide a process that will take less
or equal to a year and less than $1 million. So this is a very important
regulatory reform measure that has been worked out extensively in
coordination with the department and I ask your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Yancey,
Representative Presnell rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I ask someone, maybe Leo or someone that has been
here for awhile, is this the inter-basin transfer that Mitch Gillespie
fought for quite some time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Johnston yield to a question
from the lady from Yancey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding from looking around that is, it is
not the bill that he fought. Is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady wish to ask a question or debate the
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Has anyone spoke to DNR?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady wish to direct a question towards
Representative Millis from Pender County?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Pender yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.</p>

<p id="220:00">
Has anyone from DENR been informed about this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am, DENR has been. This is actually a DENR bill. It's been done
in coordination with the Division. The individual that you actually
mentioned is actually understanding of this bill. This is not taking
away any aspects of our regulation in regard to regulatory, excuse me,
in regard to inter-basin transfers, but rather streamlining the process
to be more efficient for the modification of someone who wants to
actually transfer water from one basin to another. So no deregulation,
just a more efficient permitting process. Hope that answers your
question. I'll entertain any more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So Mitch Gillespie of DENR is fully involved, he understands this, is
that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Yancey wish to direct the question to the gentleman
from Wake, who may be able to answer that? Does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Dollar, yield to the lady from Yancey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I gladly yield. And let me just assure you, this has nothing to do with
the Catawba and the Yadkin and those rivers. What it has to do with is
actually the Neuse and the Cape Fear. And what this net effect of this
provision will do is allow us, the Western Wake Partners, to make some
modifications to a current inter-basin transfer agreement that we have
because this area, this metropolitan area, sits right along the ridge
between those two basins. We consolidated our water systems, we
basically had two water systems in this region. They work very well
together. This simply allows the Western Wake Partners, which is a
conglomeration of a whole host of water folks, to make some
modifications to their inter-basin transfer agreement without having to
spend several million dollars and entail about seven or eight additional
years. All the public hearings will be held as normally do, but it
shortens the process literally by about seven or eight years. I would
definitely appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Pitt, Representative Brown,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forth the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative B. Brown moves to amend the bill on page 15, line 8, by
rewriting the line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brown has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this amendment is a very simple
amendment, just some clarifying and technical corrections. It's made up
of two sections. The first section is some clarifying language
particularly dealing with House Bill 488. It only affects Greenville
Utility Commission. And then the second part of it is just some
technical correction dealing with the severability clause and I urge
your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? For what purpose
does the lady from Buncombe, Representative Fisher, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the amendment sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Pitt yield to the lady from Buncombe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With greater trepidation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Brown. My question is, you may recall a bill
with the number 488 that had to do with the moving of the water system
from the city of Asheville to the Metropolitan Sewerage District, the
MSD, in Asheville. My question is, first of all, does this exclude
Greenville from 488? From the effects of 488?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I said in my presentation of the amendment this actually deals with
488. Presently, Greenville is already excluded from 488 because we do
not meet the population threshold of 120,000 people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a follow up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Representative Brown. My next
question is do you know of any other city in North Carolina other than
Asheville that that would affect?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What would affect?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That 488 would affect?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's really not germane to this bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well it is, in term of
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wait, the Chair would ask the members to direct the conversation through
the Chair. Does the lady wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you agree that inasmuch as the amendment that you have offered
relates to 488, this question relates to 488?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I suppose so.

purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover Representative Catlin rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] to debate the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman
has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now just to make you
aware that one of the driving forces behind this bill was for coastal
counties. We have intervasive transfer problems in our coastal regions,
particularly Brunswick County, Representative Ilers district, that a
five foot high hill in the middle of the county will make it where you
can’t run a water line from one side of the county to the other.
Fortunately my county got grandfathered in otherwise we would not be
able to take water from the river and pump it to the beach or take
sewage from the beach and communities and put it in the treatment plan
in the river so that’s one of the very important part of this bill. It
helps the intervasive transfer on the coastal communities it does have
very almost invisible coastal ??. so I urge your support of the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson,
Representative McGrady rise?[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I completely agree with the representative from New
Hanover County. I think we’ve got three different water systems in this
state and you've got to recognize the coast is different than the
mountains, it's different then Piedmont. This is a well-crafted bill,
bottom line. I'm not a big proponent of ?? and transfers but you need to
recognize that the coastal plane has some issues that need to be
appropriately addressed and this bill does it and I would recommend your
vote for the bill[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion further debate on

Senator Brock’s bill, and when he presented it in education, he told
about his motivation for creating the bill. And it came from talking
with a group of middle school students and said he routinely asked
students what they think would make a good bill, and this idea actually
came from a Cherokee youth who said, “Why would they not let you use
Cherokee as your language when you’re going to college, the language
that you need to graduate?” He thought it was a great idea and so it
became his bill. This would require that the UNC constituent
universities develop and implement a policy to allow Cherokee to be used
to qualify as their foreign language, which is kind of odd, but foreign
language requirement for graduation purposes. I am an enrolled member of
the eastern band of Cherokee. My grandfather was actually one of the
Cherokee youth who was sent to a retraining school to take the Cherokee
out of him, and they were punished for speaking their language. The
Cherokee language almost died out, and they’re now teaching it in
schools again and is actually a course you can take at Western Carolina
University. It’s not offered at other constituent universities, but it
can be taken through Western. And many Cherokee youth are now taking it
in an emerging program in the schools in Cherokee on the reservation,
and if they came to college and could show competency in that language,
it would count as their foreign language, exactly like a child who came
competent in Spanish or French. I would ask your support for this bill,
please. Thank you.

it’s a good effort.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Buncombe,
Representative Fisher, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to speak on the bill just
briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think you heard be say this before, and I just want
to refresh your memories. This, I think, is a very worthy bill of
passage, and one reason I believe that is because I have visited the
school where they teach the Cherokee language. And it’s very impressive
because when you walk in there is a line that you see on the floor, and
when you cross over that line you’re speaking Cherokee from then on. And
it’s an incredible way to preserve this heritage, and I think this is
really an affirmative way to show how important it is to have preserve
that language. So I do support the bill, and I hope that you will join
me in that. Thank you.

Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House, this is an agency bill.  The
commissioner asks our support of this bill.  What this bill will do is
improve enforcement components of our animal welfare law by transferring
that authority from the Department of Health and Human Services to NCDA.
 It allows for better enforcement of the current 72 hour holding period
for animals picked up by animal control, to go forward and those animals
may be ID'd and then their rightful owner may be found if that's
possible.  It provides for better allocation of our spay and neuter
funds that help reduce our unwanted pet population, does several other
things.  I'd be happy to answer any questions that members may have.  I
think Representative Harrison does have an amendment; I am not opposed
to that amendment, and I don't think the department is either.  It is my
understanding that the Senate does not oppose her amendment as well.

Representative Harrison moves to amend the bill on page one, line eight
by rewriting that line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this will
add a new section six to this animal welfare bill that deals with the
confinement of animals in vehicles.  We had legislation on this that
passed unanimously in Judiciary B earlier in this session and this is a
provision that was in this bill.  It had a healthy debate in committee.
It simply clarifies our state law that allows rescue personnel to rescue
animals that are suffering or are trapped in a vehicle.  And there's
some question about whether the state law currently allows that.  But
there are many local ordinances that have been adopted, but it's not
clear that the state statute allows for this.  We've had several
high-profile deaths of service dogs in hot cars, and I could cite you
statistics, but I don't want to keep going on this debate on how
temperatures affect cars whether it's sunny or not.  So I would like
your support.  As Representative Ramsey indicated, the Senate sponsors
do support the bill; the AKC supports the bill; we had wide bipartisan
support on this legislation that was filed earlier this session, and I
urge your support of this important animal welfare provision.  Thank
you.

Committee substitute for house bill 618 the bill ?? enacted to amend the
firearm restoration law by shortening the time period a person must wait

a person who has more than one nonviolent felony may petition for
restoration of firearm rights after waiting an additional period of time

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative
Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman this bill is about changing the timeframe to
restore the opportunity for convicted felons of nonviolent felonies to
be able to apply to have their rights back. A few years ago you used to
be able to, after you served your sentence, five years later you
automatically got your rights back if it was a nonviolent felony. You
didn’t have to do anything, you just got your rights back automatically.
Few years ago the law was changed, and they said you have to now wait 20
years and then you have to go to a judge and pay a fee and apply to get
your rights back. What it didn’t do was grandfather those folks that had
already had their rights restored that now lose them again because of
this 20 year timeframe and this bill, I initiated this bill because of
just such an individual who got caught up in this thing who’s now
married, has a kid to take care of and everything else and he had to
give his guns up when they changed that law. The situation now, what
this bill will do will knock it from 20 years down to 10 years. It
raises the fee from 200 dollars to 250 dollars when you apply, so if a
felon has not been convicted of a violent felony, after he’s been out of
trouble, hasn’t had any trouble with the law for 10 years, he can pay
250 dollars and go in front of a judge who will make a determination if
he gets his rights back to own a weapon. So again this is for nonviolent
felonies and it also does not include drugs. If it’s a drug dealer or a
drug user, even though it may have been nonviolent, it’s not included
under this so they still are not gonna be able to do it. So I think this
is fair, ten years is a fair waiting period, and I hope that you will
support this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and let me start off by saying to Representative

stated in JB other than</p>

<p id="250:00">
[Speaker Changes] the drug issues and let me explain why. I mean, let’s
sort of be clear that the sole purpose of the bill is to get firearms
into the hands of felons faster. And that bothers me immensely. But I do
understand the point that the representative is making. And the question
becomes sort of what period of time, and I have an objection to the
change, but my bigger objection is to the second part. So the smaller
objection is, we’re moving from twenty to ten. I don’t know whether ten,
or fifteen, or twenty is a good time. But what I do know, and I know
representative Jordan spoke to this a little differently in committee,
is that we don’t allow past offenses to be expunged until fifteen years
or longer. If we’re not gonna allow past offenses to be expunged for
fifteen, fifteen strikes me as certainly the reasonable period of time
to allow a prior felon to get a firearm, or petition for one. Now there
are differences and I make no bones about it, and thats why thats not my
major objection. It is an objection and I think because the ten years is
arbitrary, we have fifteen in the law for its functions, it ought to be
the same kind of thing. My bigger objection is the issue of multiple
felonies. And I don’t much care whether it was violent, I mean I think
its good that we have the violence and the drug cases out of here,
because the original bill allowed drug offenses to be in. If someone has
multiple felonies on their record, and this prior law said, “You know
people make a mistake and you get the right to get your firearm rights
restored after you’ve fulfilled your sentence if you haven’t made any
others&quot;, and I think that’s fair. But when people make multiple
felonies, these are not misdemeanors, they have been convicted of
multiple felonies, and not in the same transactions, because that is
taken care of. These have to be in multiple transactions. If someone has
done that, you know, we end up waving our constitutional rights in a lot
of the criminal law, when we forfeit our right or we give up our right
to freedom because we violated the law, we give up our right on lots of
constitutional rights when we go to excess. There is nothing in the
second amendment that at all requires states to give former felons, let
alone repeated felons, their firearms back. And from a safety point of
view, I have real concerns about repeated felons having access. There
may be ways to do it, and there may be limited ways to do so. The
circumstance Representative Speciale brought to the committee may have
been one of those. The problem is that we are now opening it up to allow
petitions, and I recognize that the judge could say no. But we are
allowing petitions across the state, with the political issue that is
firearms these days, for anybody with multiple felonies. This doesn’t
even say two prior, you could have eight prior, and this opens it up to
it. Well I guess for me, thats a safety issue. And there is a point at
which our concern for public safety has to trump other concerns. And I
guess thats my biggest objection to this bill. I could live with the ten
years, even though I disagree with it. I probably even could live with
it if we put two felons in with the maintaining the fifteen year
timeframe. But I can’t for the life of me, see a good public policy
reason to allow someone who could have three, four, five, six, seven
felonies on their record, to be suggesting that we want to give them any
right to get their firearms back. I think that’s something they
forfeited by committing repeated felonies against the public. Thank you.

[Speaker Changes] To ask bill sponsor a question.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentlemen from Craven yield to the gentlemen

[Speaker Changes] I yield.

[Speaker Changes] Actually, Representative Glazier may have answered my
question, but I’d rather hear it from the bill sponsor. Does this bill
allow someone convicted of, and you mentioned in the bill digest simple
possession, but multiple times (one after another), can they then get
their firearms rights back? Is that what this bill allows?
[Speaker Changes] If it has anything to do with drugs, no. Is that what
you just asked?

The first group; trafficking, manufacturing, etc. Possession multiple

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to ask representative specialty a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Craven yield to the gentleman

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is one question that may help clarify and I agree
with your answer. We've got the drug offences out. What it does allow
however, is someone to apply with multiple felonies on their record.
Outside of violent felonies or drug felonies, so it dos limit check ??,
forgery, any felony that's out there, security fraud; pick a felony. It
does allow anyone with multiple felonies, unlimited felonies, to apply.
Would that be correct?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] We've had some discussion here about multiple

says the court may grant a petition. Does that mean the judge has

entitled; technical changes to small group health plan. And we changed
the date because the President has backed up one of the requirements and
we didn't want the small employers to have to undergo that extra expense
of meeting the requirements of the ACA before 2015. This is the very

Thank you sir.
I noticed changing to January 2015 because of the change that's been
made in Washington, I've heard news reports that there may be an effort
to change the other part relating to individuals and put it off a year,
so would it necessitate us maybe coming back to make a change in that if
that happens, if they do it after we've left for the summer?

The gentleman is recognized to respond to the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now if there's a change in individual health plans, that would not have
an effect on the state health plan because the state health plan is a

Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a bill that came over from Senator

that allows the expansion of natural gas and propane in some of these
larger farms, specifically in the east. Unfortunately, Rutherford county
