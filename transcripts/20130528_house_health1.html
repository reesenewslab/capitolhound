We call this meeting to order. The ?? serving the committee this morning
are, Cindy Beaver, Emma Hashtrim and Madison Hendrick. Thank you for
your service this morning. Sergeant Arms, serving the committee this
morning are Fred Heinz, Reggie Sills, John Brandon, Mike Clampitt, thank
you gentleman. We have one bill before the committee this morning,
Senate Bill 208 Effective Operation 1915 BC Waiver. There is a PCS
before the committee without objection. Representative Dollar present
the bill. [Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee. What we have here Senator Tucker sent over to us in Senate
Bill 205 frame work which what we have done through a number of
venerations and I want to thank the staff, Jan Paul, Walker Regan, Dr.
Porter, Sarah Riser and I think some others that have worked on this, is
to refine the bill that Senator Tucker sent to us. I think it was termed
at one point in time The Red Flag Bill, and those that are familiar with
that will certainly know that we’ve kept to that spirit and refined it
further. Let me just try to explain and ill try to keep it relatively
brief and obviously we’ll be available to answer whatever question you
might have. This is actually the third, or at least in my view, the
third in a series of bills. General Assembly made a decision in 2011 to
expand what’s called the 1915-B and 1915-C Waiver state wide. Those
waivers, under those waivers we operate in Medicaid our Mental Health
Services, our Intellectually and Developmentally Disabled Services, as
well as Substance Abuse Services. The state had established a pilot some
seven or eight years ago with Piedmont Behavioral Health, that pilot
demonstrated both tremendous strengths in terms of the provision of
quality services and as well as considerable savings with regard to
state funds, it was actually a nationally recognized model. So, the
decision of the General Assembly in 2011 was to expand that state wide.
Now, since that time, since the passage of House Bill 916 the house also
passed last year House Bill 191, if I remember correctly, it was a bill
that with some further refining, addressing some managerial issues,
governance issues, there was a committee put together of stakeholders,
that bill was crafted, it was passed in furtherance of making the
transition from the local management entities into the pubic mange-care
organizations. The target date was set and will be met, and is being met
July 1 of this year for the entire state to be operating under 1915-B
and 1915-C Waivers. We knew it would not be an easy transition and its
has had its challenges, but the key, I think in Mental Health is for us
to have a plan and stick to it. I think that has been the thing that has
troubled the state over the year, we don’t always stick to a plan that
we make. This time we are trying to stick to it and we’re also trying to
make adjustments as we need to make those along the way. Senate Bill 208
in my view is sort of the third bill in this series, some of the issues
that have come up, there were questions with regard to the Secretary’s
authority to transition to a smaller number of LMNCO’s. As many of you
know there were forty some groups that were years ago</p>

Advisory board. As these LME MCOs get larger our counties have expressed
an interest to continue to be engaged. They're engaged anyway because
they're appointing the members of the LME MCO Governor's Board, but
we've also provided for an opportunity to have an additional advisory
board of county commissioners. It can be established to, sort of,
relieve the concern about continuing to have input from the, from the
counties. We are also in this process eliminating under section 9 the
ability to have a single county LME MCO. Everybody is gonna have to
operate in the state under the same set of rules and regulations. So
we're taking care of an issue that was there. Mr. Chairman, I covered a
lot of ground. We certainly will attempt to answer any questions or
probably will call on staff if folks have questions that they want to
ask. I would just simply sum up to say that what we are committed to,
and what I hope this committee will endorse, and this general assembly
will endorse, is a continued commitment to have an effective waiver
program statewide in the area of mental health. Mental health is a
difficult area in need of reform. I believe that we are, have
established a structure to have one of the best mental health systems in
the country. But we have to continue to work at it to make sure that
it's operational, and to make sure that, that our goal of having
statewide effective operation of the 1915 BNC waivers is the reality
moving forward. Mr. Chairman I'd be pleased to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of concerns, if I
may. Legislature in 2001, as I recall, did mental health reform. And
then about 2007 it seemed like everybody was surprised and concluded,
well my goodness, it's not working. And it was almost as though we spent
six or seven years walking away from a reform that had been put in
place, that was supposed to ensure patient care in communities outside
of the traditional psychiatric hospitals. And it wasn't happening. My
question is, as we move to these new LME MCOs, is there something in
this bill, or in the plan for the operation, that is going to provide
that continuing monitoring process of patient care and to guard against
complaints that I hear often at home of concerns that MCOs and LME are
gonna satisfy the state financially by keeping down costs by denying
needed services. So, what's the plan for monitoring how well this is
working so we don't get surprised down the road that it isn't. And how
are we going to be sure that the care is happening rather than just the
financial management?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well it, I would answer that in a couple of ways. One
of the things that we did last year in House Bill 191 was to change the
government's model. That will not be fully in effect until October 1 of
this year. So, and in that governance, what we did was, we ensured that
on the LME MCO board, that we would have additional financial and legal
expertise so that folks could successfully operate what is essentially a
small insurance, well not a small but an insurance company, a
significant insurance company. In addition to that, we balanced that by
bringing back what had been lost over the years, and that was
representation on those boards of consumers and of the CFAC??, the
advocacy folks in the various areas. So, folks from substance abuse,
mental illness, and IDD would all have representation, voting
representation, on the actual LME MCO boards. And the reason why the
element was brought back was to ensure that the...</p>

<p id="15:00">
Boards would be able to, would be responsive, and the voices that you’re
talking about would be heard, right there as those boards are making
those decisions. And we’re in the process of transitioning to that. And
that will not really be fully complete until October 1 of this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the department have any role in monitoring these local
LMEs as it relates to whether services are being provided, quality of
services. For example, something as simple, maybe it’s not simple except
to state it, as whether or not a person who’s got a mental illness is
taking a medication that if they take it, they tend to be able to
function and stay out of emergency rooms and stay out of problems with
the law. Is that kind of data monitored by somebody other than the LME
MCO or to determine that the LMEs MCO is not itself overlooking its own
shortcomings, notwithstanding the ability of some of the board members
to question it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. Yes. Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
short answer is yes, but for probably a little more detailed answer, if
the Chairman wishes to recognized Kelly Crosby from the Department of
Health and Human Services, to talk about how they monitor the LME MCOs,
and the other thing that I would mention too is obviously individuals if
they feel they’re not receiving appropriate services, they have an,
there is an administrative appeal process internally and then ultimately
with OAH. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Crosby? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Kelly Crosby,
Division of Medical Assistance. To start back to your earlier question
about monitoring utilization. We don’t just monitor solvency, because I
hear your concern that the MCOs will be staying within their budgets but
cutting services. We do monitor appeals and grievances on a monthly
basis, and authorizations and denials, so we actually know how many
services are denied on a monthly basis at the MCO level. We also monitor
the number of appeals and the number of appeals that are overturned at
OAH. We also monitor annual access. We require all the MCOs actually CMS
requires all the MCOs to do a gap analysis annually of all the services
to ensure that there are adequate services provided to their attachment
area. When NCTracks comes live beginning in October, we will start
collecting shadow claims. So a copy of every claim that an MCO pays to a
provider, so we can monitor utilization just like with did with our old
system. We can actually know how many people are served by service, how
many units they’re getting, how much those services are costing the
MCOs, so we can actually track per service. You know, this month there
were a thousand individuals, next month there’s only 850, what happened
to those 150 individuals? We also have annual reviews and part of our
annual reviews when we go on-site, we do look at the administrative
operations but we actually do chart reviews. So we look at services that
were authorized and denied. We do a sampling of those to be sure that
the correct clinical decisions are being made by the clinical folks at
the MCOs. The MCOs also use something called Gold Star Monitoring. It’s
something that’s in process but that’s the piece I think that you’re
getting at to really at the provider level, are the providers doing the
right thing for their clients? Are they making sure people are taking
their medication or actively engaged in treatment? That’s really hard to
do on the individual level but the MCOs really do monitor their provider
network to make sure that they’re providing the best quality of
services. And finally, we do have consumer satisfaction surveys that we
do do annually, so we see how consumers like or don’t like the services
they’re receiving or not receiving. And we also collect annual measures
of utilization from the MCOs so things like ED utilization and hospital
readmissions, we do look at on an annual basis just to ensure that folks
aren’t missing low levels of care and ending up in the ED or the
hospital so there are a lot of different ways we monitor patterns of
service and patterns of care, to look at some of those bigger questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one quick comment and then I’ll be quiet and let
somebody else have a chance.</p>

<p id="20:00">
It seems to me that as we, I understand, are moving towards more
electronic medical records and the filling of prescriptions that
especially with people that we have a concern whether they're being
compliant in taking their medications as they should, that if somebody
is electronically filing for reimbursement for a medication, and if
we've got a medical record for someone who's on Medicaid saying they're
supposed to get it every thirty days, it ought to be sort of a
technological assignment that doesn't sound to me like it ought to be
tough to say is Joe Blow being compliant in taking his medicine, and if
he isn't is somebody following up with him?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Crosby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Kelly Crosby, Division of Medical Assistants. I agree with you, and I
would say that, through CCNC who is our medical home for most of the
individuals with serious mental illness who are on these types of
medications, one of the things that CCNC does do for Medicaid recipients
is look at their medications, try to justify the medications against
each other, look at who's refilling these prescriptions. CCNC is doing a
lot of this in partnership with the LME MCOs, they do have to have
access to all those medications through their database so they're able
to see some of our higher end individuals who have mental illness to
make sure that they're refilling their prescriptions, that different
prescriptions aren't counteracting each other, and I know that at least
one, maybe even more of our of our MCOs have actually hired specialty
pharmacists to actually look at this. So we do use our pharmacy data to
make these type of decisions. It's really more at the - people can fill
their prescriptions, and you can monitor that, but really it is the
individual provider that has a relationship with the person, that knows
that they're actually taking those medications or not, so that's what I
was referring to before about the MCOs having to monitor their provider
network to ensure that that, those clinical interventions are happening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Is the question for the sponsor in regards to
the contemplated further MCO development for the rest of the Medicaid
delivery, are they going to overlap these MCOs as we see them now for
behavioral healthcare, to cut out confusion or perhaps add to the
confusion, is there going to be an Eastern, Central, and Western MCO,
contemplated at least in the HHS proposals that we've heard floated
around that will actually be proposed for these same regions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think ultimately, well, The General Assembly will make the decision on
what kind of Medicaid system that we have in the state. What we launched
into here in 2011 was again an expansion of an incredibly successful
pilot that started out in five counties, it's expanded now. PBH has
become a cardinal innovations - none of these things are easy, and what
we're doing in this senate bill is a further refinement of that process
so, I think the general assembly is, in my impression, is very committed
to having a successfully operating statewide 1915BNC waivers for our
mental health substance abuse and intellectually and developmentally
disabled services, and I would expect that we would want to continue to
keep that strong and moving forward, down the road, that's certainly the
intent of this legislation in which we're further clarifying, we're
ensuring that these LME MCOs are going to be strong, if they have to
merge, how they merge, how they operate, what the standards are, and
obviously ensuring that our partner, our very critical provider partners
all across the state will be paid, particularly if they're transitioning
to fewer LME MCOs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield.

Thank you Mr. Chair. I had a couple of questions. The first one was in
reference to the fund balances in section 5B on page 5, and my question
basically is, I think that change, if I'm correct is due to...</p>

him me off with the CMC vision emerging commenced here. how has that
worked the existing situation through the prorating funding from the
transfers as a portfolio with the NCOs emerged as well that will work
and in the staff maybe better to answer the question, but what we
thought we have had, prior to has-been enemies transitioning into MCI's
full which we had procedures and then contracts and like to do that with
this is doing more with the merging of an element of an existing Army

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair about our letter felt with regard to specifically how that
has worked in the past research staff would need to defer either to our
financial staff of the department or fiscal research staff, not who is
who was present out with Bogart how that had actually come a practical
standpoint, operated on the ground in the past. I don't know Ms. Bush is
president for fiscal research has anything to add. we know we haven't
had is we are just now having our first in CO merging with another MC,
which is see of the merger as process with the Western Highlands and
smoking them. and it's my understanding there there close to a contract
agreement for Hal that is merging together and it I've been in certain
respects, it's going to be the HSK seven speak for how how to make that

forward well considering the circumstances

thank you Mister Russert have a couple questions on one of the things
and presentations, as well as in private conversations with managed-care
companies him a Taliban advantage of something that they are not able to
do is provide services that are necessarily paid for by Medicaid. in
other words, what was a perfect example, we heard repeated several times
by our director of Medicaid was the issue of the lady repeatedly going
to the emergency room because she didn't have air conditioning to the
McKinsey has with their budgets. the debate under there, so they free of
that same type of the restrictions and they can have a flexibility to
really do they see a need that is an claim on the list that they can
take care of it where they do manage to the Iranians. he has also
managed eight dollars, as well as federal Medicaid dollars and in terms

work and do that sort of thing in these communities. People know where
resources are that are outside the realm, and obviously they work as
they can to help people identify additional resources, whether it’s an
air-conditioning program or fuel program that’s run through some other
part of state government, making sure people get hooked up to those
resources. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s language in here about an LME-MCO disengaging.
What is the process for one of the clients or service people who are
receiving services disengaging, and I mean by that moving… if they move
in the state from one MCO to another? What is the process? Because we
recently heard some issues and I actually had run a bill on the county
of origin that was kind of a stumbling block. What has been put in place
to make the movement of our citizens from one area of the state with
this new setup more convenient and no lapse in services and things of
that nature? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I think we’re hopeful your bill’s
going to pass the General Assembly because I think it takes care of
that. I don’t… That’s not really part and parcel of this legislation.
Ms. Crosby… Well at the direction of the Chair… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms.
Crosby. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know if Ms. Crosby has comments she
wants to make about those individuals. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m Kelly
Crosby, Division of Medical Assistance. Right now, at least on the
Medicaid side, and the state funds follow, there’s a contract for a
particular catchment area. That’s how they set the capitation, that’s
how they enroll providers, that’s how Medicaid eligibles get services;
they know their catchment area. That’s the LME that’s on your Medicaid
card, so to actually have one county go to another LME-MCO, it’s a big
deal, so a lot of things need to get changed at the system level in
terms of resetting the capitation, making sure providers all move to the
other MCO, consumers all are able to maintain their services, so getting
the waiver approved by CMS to move one county to another LME, so were
that ever to happen, and I think Smoky Mountain and Western highlands
merging together is a good example of that, what they have done is put
together a project plan for us, and it’s something that we monitor with
them on a weekly basis because on a state level we’ve got to do all
those things in terms of tell CMS we need to change the waiver
application, that these new counties now belong to this MCO. We have to
change to capitation rate entirely and get it actuarially certified by
CMS. We have to have a transition plan that says if you are a provider
formally enrolled with Western Highlands, Smoky will be able to just
accept you into their provider network. If you are a recipient, how are
we going to do outreach and education to all the recipients to know that
they can maintain their services, hopefully with the very same provider
who’s now just a Smoky Mountain center provider. So it really is…
there’s administrative things we have to do, but there really is an on
the ground level project plan that has to happen in terms of educating
providers and consumers and making sure that to the consumer at a
provider agency, people are transitioned into services, and that’s
something that we’ve required all along throughout this transition, that
MCOs touch every provider and all recipients to ensure that folks are
able to transition from one provider to another or one MCO to another,
but it’s a lot of work and it’s quite complicated. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair, a clarification please. I was asking actually the consumers
changing. So if you lived in Buncombe and you move to Raleigh to
Alliance, what process do they go through when the provider that they’ve
been using in Buncombe and they’ll need somebody new, what’s the
step-by-step process you use for that person to reestablish services and
get payments and things of that taken care of. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Kelly
Crosby, Division of Medical Assistance. I’m sorry I answered the wrong
question. That’s not as… That’s a bit of a messier answer, to be
perfectly honest with you, and I think that is why you’ve introduced
your bill. Individuals are tied by their county to particular LME. Their
county in our Medicaid eligibility system determines which LME they’re
assigned to, and we know that that is challenging for children and
adults who have a county of eligibility in one LME but may have a
residency or a treatment facility several counties away or many counties
away, so what actually</p>

<p id="35:00">
...happens is two things. Sometimes people just move and they have to go
to the new county DSS and register their new address and get a new
county of eligibility. Therefore they get a new LME on their Medicaid
card and they’ve got to engage with services there. At that point, when
they go through that process and they get a new LME, the LME is
notified. They know every month new eligibles are. They have to provide
outreach and information about their provider network and their services
to engage in a new county. That is if they have moved. Probably the
worst part about that process really is is that sometimes the county of
eligibility can change can take 30 to 60 days and that is something that
we’ve got a group trying to figure out how to streamline that for
individuals who literally just move across the state and have to get
re-established in a new county.
Probably the more challenging, and again we do have a work group looking
at this too, are those individuals who may have a county residence in
one area and they’re just being placed as a treatment provider somewhere
else.  So we have providers across the state all over the place who have
to enroll with different LMEs. Some of them only have to enroll with an
LME for one individual that they’re serving and it’s pretty complicated.
I do believe we have a very dedicated group looking at both law around
eligibility to see if there’s anything we can do to switch county of
eligibility a lot easier and quicker, but also besides that, while that
gets done, what can we do for providers who are providing services for
single people across multi-county lines. To do a very quick
standardized, uniform contract so the individual can maintain their same
provider, the provider can get paid in a timely fashion and not have to
wait to go through a lengthy enrollment or credentially process with
another LME. I think, ideally, we just really want to have a statewide
uniform credentialing for any provider. Yes, an LME can choose which
providers they want to be in their network, sure, but all providers are
credentialed and enrolled in Medicaid, if you will. The LME can choose
which providers they want to deal with. So providers it doesn’t have to
be difficult no matter where an individual lives they can go, they can
maintain their same providers and providers can get paid. It is not a
neat process right now. Not at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have just a couple of questions. One has to
do...I think, Representative Dollar, you mentioned that all LMEs...the
phrase I use is the back room functions that there’s something in this
bill that would authorize this secretary to standardize the back room
functions or did I miss that? I think that’s been one of the big
problems with the mergers is that a lot of LMEs have their own financial
system or their billing system and they haven’t been able to….it’s
caused billing problems.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Obviously that’s being worked on. Let me refer that to Ms. Paul. Or Mr.
Chairman, if you could recognize Dr. Porter, I think she can respond to
this question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Porter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pat Porter, consultant to the General Assembly. Could you ask the
question one more time again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It has to do with….let me put it this way: I believe that House Bill 916
authorized the department to ensure that the LMEs that were coming on
board with NCOs would adopt the backroom functions that were held by
PBH. That didn’t happen. That’s created some problems and so I
understand that there’s a process going on. I’m fine of PBH needs to
change. Some of this needs to be negotiated, but how is that going of
getting the backroom functions the same. Especially if an NCO fails and
has to merge, if their backroom functions are different that’s going to
make their merger more difficult.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are actually three things going on in relation to that. The first
one is internal. The council community programs has been working with
each of the 11 LME/MCOs to begin to standardize their backroom
processes, information technology, claims, billing, contracts, so that’s
going on within that group so that they can transmit information one to
the other and to that...</p>

I will insist on that. the second thing that's going on is that the
department is working okay to make each of them more compliant with the
standards that they have said the third is within this bill. this calls
for standardized contract that hasn't been in place online that
aluminium CIOs. some of them have a contract. this not entirely, but
significantly different from the other only NCOs, and this requires a
standardized contract and that will help considerably follow-up,

that is that it that is no, I didn't seem to be any of them small that

there was a reason why the NCOs. originally I think we had it in the

that they would actually know their providers and very well personally
