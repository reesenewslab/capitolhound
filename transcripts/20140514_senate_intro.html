Mr. President, thank you for a brief moment of personal privilege out of
order. Members of the Senate, there is a, today, a vacancy in this
chamber and it is, at least partially, covered by the flowers that are
seated next to the Lieutenant Governor. They are there in memory of
Senator Nesbitt. It's interesting that this is the first session that
we've had since, I think, 2004 where Martin Nesbitt has not occupied a

Speaker: Tom and Martin from last year, probably immediately after some
toe to toe, they had gone through involving some part arcane matter. No
offense to the folks in Ashville, dealing with the city of Asheville,
but If you want to come by and look at the picture, they are engaged in
a good conversation there as was the case with Tom and Martin on a
regular basis. And I know all of you have, or share those same memories,
so we are going to miss Senator Nesbitt and Mr.  President if it is
appropriate, I would like to, as we adjourn today, to adjourn in memory
of Senator Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr.
[Speaker changes] Thank you Senator. Senator Apodacas, for what purpose
do you rise?
Senator Apodacas: Mr. President, Mr. President I have a motion please.
Mr. President: Senator Apodacas recognized for a motion.
Senator Apodacas: First Mr. President, let me make a quick observation.
Itâ€™s finally good to see Senator Brock and Senator Stein not look like
the youngest people in the room now. We have Senator Jackson, actually
they look rather elderly compared to him, but anyway, that being said, I
move that we do by adjourn, recess, excuse me recess until one fifteen.
Mr. President: That objection to sentence stands in recess until one
fifteen.
