...disclosure, I'd like to be recused from voting on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So noted.  Representative Holloway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Representative Hager, you bring forth a lot of
really good bills to this committee, and normally I would just come in
here and vote for this and probably have no questions.  But this morning
I received an email from my county commissioners that had a lot of
concern about this bill, particularly the part with the 500 dollar cap
on consulting costs.  And I was curious why we here at the state want to
limit what counties can spend for consultants.  And part of their
argument is they don't have, necessarily, the resources to do some of
this in house.  And from my understanding, consultant fees are a lot
more than 500 dollars, and they just got a lot of concern about that.
And I was curious as to why would we do that in this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Great question, Representative Holloway.  In the P.C.S. it's
moved up to a thousand dollars.  If you look at it, it's twice as much.
Part of what we see, and I've got an example here, when the tower's
originally built, it goes through a structural analysis, as many of you
may or may not know.  I've got a structural analysis that is sealed by a
professional engineer on the front here.  When the co-location is done,
that structural analysis by the tower company happens again.  The
structural analysis by the co-locating company happens again.  Because I
assure you that the insurance companies of these tower companies, and
the tower companies themselves and the co-locator companies, don't want
these to fall either.  Now if we continue to push these limits, we've
seen as many as five, six, seven, eight thousand dollars for these fees.
 And what happens is it makes it uneconomical to co-locate some of
these.
Now, this is only for co-location.  This doesn't...the thousand dollar
cap is not for the original design of the tower, not for the original
tower.  And if it's a substantial improvement in the tower, and that's
identified in the bill, the thousand dollar cap is not for them.  This
is for what is called a less than substantial change in the tower.  So
it's looked at a couple times already.  So you've got that already built
into the system, and I actually have got a report here, be glad to show
you, of what the tower company does themselves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one quick follow-up, Mr. Chair.  So, Representative Hager, the
thousand dollar lift in that cap, from 500 to 1000, do you think that
will satisfy my county commissioners?  I mean this isn't my training; I
don't deal with this; this is more their concern.  They just emailed me
with concern and they're a good bunch there, too.  And when they do
that, always a red flag pops up.  Is that going to ease their mind and
is their an opinion from the commissioner's association or any of these
groups?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there's a...we do have support of the... and I could be wrong,
please stand up and tell me, but I thought we had the support of the
League of Municipalities and the county folks also.  So, I think we've
got that; they've looked at it; they've bought into it.  And we've
actually modified some of this bill for some of these issues they had.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, the only other request I have is, if it's possible, maybe we
could just here from them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, the Chair has no objection to that, but let's
exhaust the committee first, if you don't mind.
Representative Samuelson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was actually going to move at the appropriate time, so I can wait.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will note that and come back to you.
Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to...I guess really the bill's sponsors have already answered this,
but it was my understanding as well that this is a consensus bill that
everybody is on board with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? could I see you for just a second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we have just a couple people who asked to speak, and the
Chair's going to recognize Patrick Ballantine.  Mr. Ballantine, if you'd
please approach the microphone, address...identify yourself for the
committee and the audience.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My name is Patrick Ballantine.  I have
recently been retained by Monroe Telecom.  They do business in North
Carolina as the center for municipal solutions.  And what they do is
serve as a facilitator for the cell tower issues.  They are hired by
local counties and municipalities to help facilitate the permitting of
these cell towers.  My client's business model is to make sure these
permits are allowed, that these cell towers and co-locations, et
ceterea, do occur because that's how he makes his money.  But this bill
goes too far.  We're concerned that what this bill would do would, in
effect, take out any independent technical assistance needed by...[AUDIO

<p id="10:00">
In small and medium sized counties. We’re okay with cell towers, with
adding to cell towers. But we just need to make sure that they comply
with the applicable codes, building codes and other safety measures.
This is a matter of public safety and protection of private property.
And, and we believe that this $1,000.00 cap is still unreasonable when
you look at something that’s maybe 30 years old that’s been added to
several times that’s gonna get added to again. We’ve got at least a
dozen, a dozen locations in North Carolina right now where the industry
would want to add onto an existing tower where there’s a load of in
excess of 100% of capacity. So this isn’t a hypothetical issue. It’s,
it’s a real public safety issue. So we would urge you to remove that cap
to allow local governments to consult with independent technical
assistance so they can facilitate the permitting here. We’re not talking
about aesthetics. We’re not talking about what color it is. I, I know
there’re, there’re different communities that have different standards.
We’re simply concerned about public safety and the protection of private
property. And, and we believe that this bill would, would usurp the
local governments authority to a hire an independent technical expert
assistance. And it’s, it’s like that jenga game, I mean it’s basic
physics. The more you add on to something, the less stable it becomes.
And this is a matter of public safety. And I appreciate you time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Valentine. Representative Hager did you
want to respond? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah I do. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I
would address, I would point everybody to on the PCS that my line
numbers may have changed but it’s under local authority for, for all the
substantial improvement and on the collocation. It, it says that except
as expressly stated nothing in this part shall limit a city from
regulating application to construct, modify, or maintain wireless
support structures or construct, modify, maintain collocated wireless on
a wireless structure, based on consideration of land use, public safety
and zoning issues. So, so the cities and counties have a right to reject
this based on safety issues already. Now we’ve got a consensus bill here
and we have the folks that are making the dollars from this are the ones
coming to you saying don’t approve this. I’ve got some, some calls here
of we generally see in some of the counties that use consultants. You
can go up as much as $9,600 in these consultants. And some jurisdictions
that don’t use consultants are in the $100 to $500 range. This is kinda
where we are guys. And you’d you’d be surprised the city, the ones don’t
use consultants are normally the ones that you would think would be
small counties, are big counties and some of them are small counties
also. So with that again I would ask you for adoption of the bill. Mr.
Chairman thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke you had a
request from the, for the chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you Mr.
Chairman. Last week some of my constituents were here and wanted to
speak and I came in a bit late and don’t know if they were able be here.
And I’m looking, trying to look back. Maybe they are not here. I
appreciate your offering them time if they had been here. I do want to
ask [SPEAKER CHANGES] Like to comment on the bill sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
 Yes, yes, yes sir. Thank you. First of all, Representative Hager, I
kind of agree with Senator Valentine that I don’t really understand why
this bill has to put the cap on what cities and counties can pay. I
mean, why are we meddling kinda in that issue? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chair. Thank you Mr. Luebke. What, what we see especially in,
in, and you probably don’t see it in your, in your district and some of
the bigger counties don’t see it in their district. But in a district
like mine where it’s not really economical to put up another tower cuz
you don’t have the absorption/g, you have the number of density of
people. Every dollar you spend makes that more uneconomical. So what
happens is the folks in the rural districts end up not having broadband,
not having mobile services which keeps our children not having access to
internet issues, not being able to use their computers as they have, not
being able to research. Trying to keep the cost cap as low as we can
provides more areas, it gives them more economics to provide more areas
to serve. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Maybe I’m misunderstanding. I thought from reading the
bill it was, this, this, this was the reference to $500 and now $1,000
as Representative Holloway said a moment ago had to do with the fee that
you could pay to a consultant. I guess that strikes me given what
lobbyists make around here $1,000 cap is pretty small, is a pretty
stringent cap. So I just wondered why is that necessary to even be in
the bill?</p>

<p id="15:00">
Something like that why shouldn't it be up to the decision of the
counties to decide what it's worth to them to get council. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Representative Leubke I appreciate the question I
think that I'm glad that we are not having a lobbyist decide where we
put cell towers and collocations but the issue is that number that
thousand dollars whether it's five hundred dollars or ninety six hundred
dollars guess who has to pay that it's the person wanting to collocate
that antenna, it's the person wanting to bring more broadband to a place
where you might have five people per square mile not five hundred people
or five thousand or fifty thousand per square mile so you  just can't
make the economics work so if you're having to pay ninety six hundred
dollars you're probably not going to bring an antenna probably not going
to do it if you're going to pay one thousand dollars that becomes, the
economics become better because it all goes to the bottom line who's
putting that antenna up that's who has to pay these issues and some of
the contracts have been based on if you find something or you got
something on a conditional you know we would want you to do this for a
reason and we're paying so this limits a lot of this conditional
consultants if you call it that and if you read the bill so it's based
on economics Representative Luebke. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I
speak on the bill? Mr Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, thank you Representative Hager for the explanations
my, the neighbors from the neighborhood groups in Durham were concerned
I think because they felt that the bill allows essentially too much to
be done to existing towers like adding on to existing towers that will
have impact on them they already have a tower close to them that they
are worried about additional and then that as they read the bill the
city has limited opportunity or county has limited opportunity to
challenge these changes and they are not happy to be as close to cell
towers as they are in Durham, in urban Durham so it seems to me that the
bill is I know you've referenced it as a consensus bill but they've
raised pretty good points with me about how it really doesn't really
protect enough of the citizens who are living close to these cell towers
so I can hear by the motions that people have wanted to make that the
votes are in on this bill but I think with Representative Holloway that
there's a lot of concerns here and I've gotten concerns from individual
county commissioners about it to so I would urge everyone to think twice
about the bill but I know it's passing anyway, Thank You. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Hager, [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke I
appreciate your words as I always do but it does limit the jurisdiction
of the seasoned counties still do have the safety issue in the bill.
They can not have a they cannot pass an application until they are
satisfied with the safety issue of the bill now they can negotiate of
course with the cell tower with whoever is wanting to collocate but
please remember this doesn't cover these rules of the thousand dollar
limit only covers the not the substantial addition and it's outlined
here not a new tower but just collocating the antenna that keeps it
under the substantial modifications. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Representative Hager. Members we have three people yet to speak on this
bill I just want to remind you we will take a vote on this bill shortly,
Representative Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairmans, I
will try and be brief I want to say two things. First I hope the
committee will support the bill, we very badly across the state and I
think especially so in more rural areas need to get wireless available
and high speed for economic development and for education purposes and
this is a step in that direction because it would provide some clarity
for the carriers that are trying to assist that by not running into
needless obstacles. Secondly, I want to call the committees attention to
a case that I think sort of illustrates why this maybe is appropriate.
It may not suggest that we shouldn't revisit the fee at some point in
the future if it proves insufficient to the need but in 2010 there was a
decision made in the US district court for the southern district on New
York when a wireless carrier brought suit against the city of Mt. Vernon
and in that particular decision there were some interesting things that
were said. One was that the ordinances pursuant to which consultants
fees were shifted to the wireless carrier were held invalid and the
court said in that instance that without a codified limit on fees that
could be assessed this was in contrast to a charge of only five hundred
dollars for other special use permits but in the case of this wireless
carrier they imposed fees...</p>

And $6012 thousand just NAR and, of an existing facility , and Mr. Cadiz

unreasonable delay encouraged by the consultants that they make
unnecessary question applications and information that delayed the
process for four months and that and they were required to consult of
which require to disgorge the consultants say that they were saved
because of lack of basic four now not suggesting all consultants fall
into that category, I think it gives a suggestion that this limitation

Mr. chairman here’s the adoption.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you very much.  Members do you have any questions for the sponsor
representative dollar you’re recognized/
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. chairman.  My read on the bill will actually will result
in repairs and improvements being made sooner but I do have one quick
question that I hope I know the answer to. From the public staff if
there is a member of the pubic staff Mr. chairman I’d just like to post
one quick question to them.
[Speaker Changes]
Okay we do have somebody here so. If you will please approach the
microphone and identify yourself for the committee
[Speaker Changes]
Sure. Good afternoon, I’m Donna Downey I’m an attorney with the public
staff.
[Speaker Changes]
Miss Downey my question is the provisions of this bill do you believe
that consumers are adequately protected with the provisions of this
legislation.
[Speaker Changes]
Yes representative we’ve worked with the bill sponsor and the advocates
with this bill and we are satisfied with it.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. chairman I would further offer a motion for favorable report for the
proposed committee substitute for 7/10 does it have a referral anywhere?
[Speaker Changes]
It does to finance. But we’re going to take that motion and come back
thank you sir.
[Speaker Changes]
And if you wouldn’t mind approaching the microphone again.
[Speaker Changes]
Donna Downey again.
[Speaker Changes]
Hi just to follow up to the question could you just specify or summarize
what the consumer protections are in here and I said this just because
this issue with the private water companies are very controversial
around this state.
[Speaker Changes]
Sure What we perceive to be the consumer protections in this bill is
that first off all this mechanism can only be implemented in the contact
of a general rate case. And it gives the commission the digression to
determine whether its appropriate another thing is there is a pin the
amount of money that can be spent and recovered in between rate cases if
its determined or if the company incurs more than that they need to come
in for a rate case and so and then also the other thing we did was
narrow the scope of the tax of improvements that can be recovered by
this mechanism .
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you very much.
Members seeing no other questions before the committee – recognize
representative Dollar’s motion put before this favor we will report to
the PCS on favorable to the original tot eh original with the referral
to finance all in favor please say aye those opposed say no. the ayes
have it representative Hager you are up again for the third time.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This bill is a bill after speaking with NC state
university and the representatives from the UNC charlotte folks. They
came to me with an issue where they would love to the folks not in NC
state because they can already preform these energy hours within their
buildings on their campus but the rest of the UNC system could not.
With the expertise we have that our epicenter UNC charlotte Engineering
centers at A&amp;T I don’t know if I said a whole lot about UNC but
we’ll leave that alone. And the energy department sat and ?? east
Carolina we thing they have the expertise within their departments to do
these now they will function as project managers once they do these
energy audits and identify areas where they’re having problems with a
bowl where they’re causing heat.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative You’ve done so well in life I regret interrupting you but
we need to have a motion to accept the PCS before us on this bill and
thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you doing this it will allow them
to perform their self-audits determine where their efficiency issues are
and coordinate the contracts with private industry to make these happen.
Basically it keeps the dollars in house say they already have the
expertise it keeps them from having to hire one of the three efficiently
consultants in the state at a high dollar cost.
[Speaker Changes]
Does that conclude your presentation?
[Speaker Changes]
Sorry yes it does gladly will take any questions
[Speaker Changes]

years I think it’s a great deal and at the appropriate time I’d like</p>
