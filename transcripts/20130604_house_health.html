[SPEAKER] Ladies and Gentlemen, if you would be seated. At this time
we’ll call this meeting of the House, Health and Human Services
Committee to order.
I’d like to begin by recognizing our pages that are with us today.
Paiges ,if you would stand and be recognized when I call your name. We
have Jordan Hall from Vance County, sponsored by Speaker Tillis. Sandy
Golsby from Hartford County, sponsored by Speaker Tillis. Lindsey
Jackson from White County, sponsored by Representative Jackson, and
Parker King from White County, sponsored by Representative Starnes.
Welcome to our committee and we hope you’re having a great week at the
General Assembly.
I’d like to recognize our House Sergeants-at-Arms today. We have Bob
Rossie, Marvin Lee, Antwone Marshall and Doug Harris. Thank you all for
what you do for us today.
Members as you look at your agenda, we’re going to pull House Bill 742
from today’s calendar. So we have three bills before us. We’re going to
begin with Senate Bill 542, Senator Cook, you’re recognized to present
your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Chairman. This bill is designed to protect
folks in adult care homes and nursing homes from drug induced
incompetence of their care providers. Under this bill applicants for
employments in these homes must pass a drug test as a condition of
employment. And employees must pass random controlled substance testing
as a condition of continued employment.
This bill provides protection from civil liability for the home officers
and employees for failure to employ people based on testing results. The
Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of
Administration says the bill has no physical impact. DHHS already drug
test applicants who are employed at the state long-term care facilities.
Most private nursing homes are currently drug screening employees. This
bill is enthusiastically supported by the North Carolina Senior Tarheels
Legislature.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Committee, any comments or questions?
Representative Stevens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I understand it’s supported by
the Senior Tarheels and I think it is a good idea but what are the
nursing homes saying about it? Because apparently a first test is
required of every employee and then submitting for random testing
afterwards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As I understand it, most of the homes now are drug
testing. This just simply puts, sort of clarifies what they’ve already
been doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions or comments from the Committee?
Seeing none, the Chair would entertain a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I make a motion that we give favorable report to
Senate Bill 542 with the ?? referral.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila removes for favorable report to
Senate Bill 542. All members in favor signify by saying aye. [aye] All
opposed no. The bill passes. Congratulations Senator Cooke and welcome
back to the House of Representatives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Thank you. It’s good to be back here. You
folks aren’t near as rowdy as I remember. [laugh]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You should have been in our last committee meeting
this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Our next item is Senate Bill 137. Senator Tillman,
welcome to the House. You are recognized to present your bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, thank you for hearing my bill. Thank
you, Committee. It’s always good to be over here with the House. We did
have to knock a few of the House edges off of Senator Cook. And it’s
more than a one year project, Mr. Chairman. We are working that yet. It
may take more than years I have left to do it but we will get it done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is out of order. [laugh] You may
proceed.
SPEAKER CHANGES] I've been that way most of my life. [laugh] Senate
Bill, 137, I have asked to have an amendment drawn by the House that</p>
