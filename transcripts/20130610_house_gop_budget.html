<p id="00:00">
We want to begin by thanking you all for joining us here today. We want
to welcome our budget leadership, our subcommittee chairs and our full
chairs, we're going to be introducing them in a few minutes. These
ladies and gentlemen have worked mightily for the past several weeks to
help craft budget that I think that everyone in the House should but,
feel great pride in, and hopefully, we'll be supporting as we move
forward this week in the Appropriations process.
Obviously, once again, we have crafted a budget that balances state
spending with our income, sets priorities and does not raise taxes.
Two-years-ago, we crafted a budget that fixed a multimillion dollar
deficit, that we had inherited from the previous leadership. We did so
by reducing state spending, setting priorities and living within our
means. We also did so while cutting taxes by more than a billion
dollars.
Because of the sound decisions that we made two-years-ago, we are on a
more stable financial footing than we were in 2011; therefore, we've
been able to craft a fiscally responsible economically sustainable
budget for North Carolina. The budget was posted online last night and a
number of you have already seen it. We have been, it has been in full
view of the public now for at least thirty-six hours, I think, or at
least it will be before the first votes are taken on this document.
You may have noticed, well, some of, some of the folks, now, I think,
and some of the staff are going to be unshaven until the budget passes,
or something like that, I don't want to, I'll let the Speaker comment on
that if he comes. The Speaker had intended to be here with us, but he's
been held up because of the weather, and he hopes to join us before the
press conference is over. Let me say this, the House's budget proposal
is realistic, it is reasonable and it is responsible, and it places
North Carolina's fiscal house on a sound foundation for the future.
I'm pleased to be joined today by all of our subcommittee chairs, but in
particular, I want to introduce and then they'll be coming up here just
in a minute to give you some, more of the details. Representative, Linda
Johnson, from Cabarrus county, Representative Bryan Holloway of Stokes
county, and Representative Justin Burr of Stanly county. The four of us
full chairs have worked mightily on this budget and I want to publicly
thank them for all they have done to craft what I think is a very fine
document. As I say, they'll be reporting on the very subject areas in
just a moment.
Let me begin with just a very brief overview of the House Budget.
In the first year, we spent around twelve-million-dollars less than the
Senate and around a hundred-eighty-eight-million less than the governor,
holding the net growth in our budget to about 1.9% over the current
year. In the second year, we spent about 1% more than the Senate;
however, we are 2% below the Governor in the second year. In the middle,
really between those two, and the primary difference is the difference
in our tax reform packages between what the Senate provide for and what
we have passed in the house. But just like our colleges in the Senate, I
would note, that we have had to address a number of mandatory
obligations, most notably, Medicaid, which was underestimated in the
Governor's original budget, we have had to adjust for that in the
House's budget.
Now, also, as I have alluded to a moment ago, the House has passed
historic tax reform, and that is included in our budget, the
ramifications of that tax reform. The House has placed
two-hundred-million-dollars in the Savings Reserves Account, and also
placed two-hundred-million-dollars in Repairs and Renovations Fund,
meeting both the targets of the Governor and the Senate in that regard.
One of the things that we wanted to do was bill back a number of funds
that have been sorely depleted in recent years and we've been able to do
that. We have funded the state health plan, we have not added to the
state's debt. We have chosen not to issue bonds or tickets?? of
participation in our budget. On the state employee's side and teacher's
side, we are providing five-days of leave to save employee's and
teachers this year, and these are full days, these are not expiring
ones. Much more importantly, we have set aside a reserve of a
hundred-and-sixty-million-dollars for compensa-</p>

and salary increases in the second year of the budget. We are fulfilling
our obligations as we live within our means. Our plan is a common sense
approach to providing the services our citizens need in the areas of
education, healthcare, public safety and job development, and with that,
what I would like to do is bring up the full chairs to go over some of
the details of some of their budget areas, some of the highlights, and
what we’d like to do is have all three of them talk about their
highlights, and then we’ll come back and entertain questions. So with
that I would like to turn it over to fellow Chair, Representative Linda
Johnson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Hi, I’m Representative Linda
Johnson and I represent Cabarrus County. Representative Dollar was
explaining that each full chair has areas that they work on, and my
three areas are education and general government and IT. We work with
the sub-chairs; some of my sub-chairs are here today. Let’s start with
education. The House budget focuses on education by stressing the need
of for innovation in schools and protecting dollars that directly impact
the classroom. The House budget proposal provides 11.5 billion for
education. It includes 7.9 billion to the K-12 system, a cut much
smaller than the Senate’s cut and similar to the Governor’s proposal. It
funds several initiatives that focus on school choice, technology,
innovation and school safety. The education budget restores the funding
for the teachers’ fellows program and reduces the LEA flexibility
adjustment. We provide 26 million in lottery funds for digital learning
initiatives in the K-12 budget. The community college system receives 1
billion in the House budget. The House planned budget’s 2.6 billion for
the UNC system, which is only a reduction of 5.5, it is larger than the
Senate’s but smaller than the Governor’s. The House education budget
recognizes the importance of education in the success of North Carolina.
One other area I handle is general government. The House budget on
general government focuses on efficiencies in state government, and do
that by setting priorities. The budget directs the Department of
Cultural Resources to seek non-state resources to fund historical sites
and museums, while funding historical sites appropriately. It fully
funds the House plan for voter identification. The other area I handle
is IT, and of course we know this is the first time we’ve had leadership
in this item, that it stands alone, and what we are doing in this budget
is investing in the security and safety improvements and efficiencies.
Now I’ll turn it over to Representative Burr. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Chairman Johnson. The two areas that I oversee is the Health and
Human Services Subcommittee and the Justice and Public Safety
Subcommittee, and we’ll run through those with you. First, the Health
and Human Services budget takes steps to protect our most vulnerable
citizens and ensure that critical services continues, such as the
alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers, protecting our psychiatric
beds and improving the ways those are funded locally, funding a new
statewide tele-psychiatry program and funding additional Medicaid
assistance programs. The Health and Human Services budget, as mentioned
by Chairman Dollar, funds the Medicaid rebase and takes steps to
continue to reform and ultimately fix our Medicaid program in North
Carolina. The Health and Human Services plan establishes a short-term
assistance for group home recipients until a payment solution can be
implemented statewide. Under the House budget, we also fund an
additional five thousand pre-K slots, bringing the total to around
thirty thousand, and it also changes</p>

The eligibility due to the 130% of the federal poverty level that is
house bill 935 that has passed a part of that house bill. And the JPS
section of the budget, the JPS budget, continues the houses commitment
to ensure the safety and security of all north Carolinians, the JPS
budget provides an additional 25 million needed for the viper system so
that can continue to be implemented across the state. our plan restores
16 natural positions that were eliminated to ensure that those rural
counties have a minimum of 4 masterites where needed. We increased the
funding to expand electronic monitoring for probationers. Fund
additional probation and parole positions to meet the requirements of
the justice reinvestment act. We add an additional 19 scholarship
positions, and the state crime lab and we expand existing programs to
fund a substance abuse treatment for high risk offenders. And those are
the 2 areas and some of the highlights for those that we have covered,
and i think we have some of the sub chairs here as well, and i want to
thank JPSM they teach us sub chairs for all there work they have done,
and at this time turn over to chairman holiday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you chairman bur, the 2 ares that i work
primarily on in the budget were transportation and NER. And i would just
briefly go through those and we will start with transportation. The
transportation budget the house transportation streamlines government by
eliminating 631 vacant positions working to implement government
quarries transportation plan and conforming to house bill 817.
Transportation budget focuses on funding projects associated with
economic development, opportunities to increase job development
potential. The plan maintains the fair structure and rates for currently
told ferry routes. The house provides more than 300 million dollars for
resurfacing. Now on to NER. NER budget includes funds for a new program
focused on growing a bio energy sector in north Carolina., The house
budget funds a clean water trust fund. Our plan funds wildlife resources
commission at a 11% reduction. NER budget also funds the rural center,
biotechnology center, grass roots science museums, High point market
authority, Johnson and wells, and RTI, and ill turn it over to chairman
dollar
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank y'all very much and again i want to thank our
full chairs and our subcommittee chairs for all the very fine work they
have done, we will be pleased to entertain any questions you may have.No
we have factored into our budget the cost of the tax plan that passed
the house last week and is up for final consideration tonight, that is
factored into this budget, its more or less revenue neutral or close to
being revenue neutral in the first year, and in the second year we have
been able to sync that up with our available resources, and im very
pleased to see that we are going to have historic tax reform this year
in the general assembly
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well since both you and the senate both have different
tax grants. don't you have to sync up your ideas for the tax plan first
before you get together and work out the budgets? those spaces have to
be the same right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well well leave the tax plans to the finance committee
and well focus on the appropriations, but we do have space in the
budget, i believe, to harmonize and make sure that we are all in sync by
the time we close session in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Few weeks, that's good to hear. We learned about a
month ago that we would have a surplus tax collections over 4 million
dollars this year, but we still don't have, you still don't have state
employee raises or teacher raises, what would you say to people who say,
we have tax collections that are over what we expected, but again for
the fourth time in 5 years no pay raises
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Most of those over collections were actually non
recurring dollars, so in other words they weren't actual increases in
ongoing dollars, recurring dollars. So in the budget at the end of the
first year we have roughly 110 million dollars recurring coming out of
the first year and around 162 million dollars recurring at the end of
the bi-enium, and of course.</p>

<p id="15:00">
you know, you can put this together. We've reserved 160 million in the
second year for compensation and potential compensation and salary
adjustments. You know, you have to really pay attention to the recurring
dollars because that's what you have to use when you're looking at
salaries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up ??. How much do you know how much of what it costs to have 1%
raise for state employees?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
1% ?? is $165 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Percent employees and teachers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that does not, and let me just add, it's more than that if you look
at DOT, the highway fund, you have to account for that as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. You include the ?? opportunity scholarships in, could you
talk about what the price tag is on that, on ?? out of the ledger on how
much it's gonna cost the state, and I guess how much it would save the
state on the other end?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well we have to get to the dollars. I think the net of that is somewhere
in the range of $10 million one way or the other, but it's relatively
small peas, it's almost the size of a pilot program, as it is in the
House budget. Land.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could someone talk about higher ed and the NC gap program and increase
in out of state tuition, is there a lawsuit behind those things? What
are you trying to do with higher education and the UNC system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The NC gap program is a program that we will take the last group to come
into the UNC system, which has unfortunately not a good track record of
attaining a graduate degree. So we're going to suggest that they attend
and get their A degree from a community college, and then guarantee
access back into the university that has accepted them in the first
place. It's gonna raise the graduation rates for everybody, it's going
to allow those kids that may well have not finished their undergraduate
degree to at least obtain an aa degree, and improve our workforce
education I think quite a bit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With that and the tuition increase, is this a way to try to control
admission to the university?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, presently UNC system is among the lowest best values in education in
the country, and it's going to continue as one of the best values in
education in the country. But we've got to be able to sustain the costs,
the ever increasing costs of textbooks and teachers, facilities, etc. So
we're trying to get the best bang for our buck and especially North
Carolina residents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? how many people how many students might use that NC gap and will they
be told you can't come in, or we suggest you go someplace else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No we're not gonna be telling anyone they have to do anything, we're
going to afford them an opportunity to improve their chances of getting
a quality degree. So and from the numbers frankly from the top of my
head, I don't recall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to say one thing. Last year we attended a conference with 13
of the major states in that- the 13 states that have the most
universities. And during that, we discusses how can we help students
reduce the amount of money they owe after they graduate and how can we
help them stay on a 4 year course? And we came back to North Carolina
and looked at our numbers and looked at the different universities, and
looked at East Carolina university who has a program similar to ?? and
saw what successes they were having, so we did it this way in the
budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The house budget includes the same provision, the Senate budget about
the lottery funds, and it basically strikes out language from back when
the lottery was created to provide a percentage of the revenues to
certain areas, what's the impetus of striking out that language and
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There's been a lot of that language that has been not withstood in the
budget for a number of years, so we're actually just making conforming
changes to how we have actually operated those funds for the last number
of years. And there's some differences in that between the House and the
Senate version, so we're obviously going to be talking with out
counterparts in the Senate, that should come up in the final version of
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you look forward to conference and negotiations with the Senate</p>

<p id="20:00">
...the key differences about the budget and tax reform. Seems to me it's
going to be a big player here. What is your message to them? Do you feel
realistically that you can reach an agreement that's gonna be okay for
both sides and our Speakers here now in terms of the timetable? Do you
feel like you can beat the timetable to get out of here how you planned?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We always meet the Speaker's timetable on the House
side. But, do our best, right? I would say if you look back at last
year, where the total hole in the budget was somewhere in the range of
two and a half billion dollars, and we didn't have a governor that was
helping us out in the process, and we were able to get that done even
with a veto mixed in. So, we are confident that we will be able to work
with the Senate work with the governor and between us, craft a budget
that I think North Carolinians will be very pleased with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why did you decide to repeal the Child Fatality Task
Force, I guess would be next July. What's the logic behind that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There had been some discussion from Committee members
and the sub-chairs and others to look at that. That was a Task Force
that was put in place, a temporary task force at one time that had been
extended over time. And, it has made some good recommendations, some
we've accepted, but I know recently a number of the things they've
continued to recommend are proposals that we have eliminated in the the
general assembly, printing presses and things that fund local nonprofits
here in Raleigh. But we want to make sure that our Chairs of the
subcommittee, they're going to continue to work on those issues. The
local Child Fatality Task Force is left in place, so that when there is
a fatality they can continue to look at that. It's simply removing a
layer of that process here in Raleigh, and we'll continue to focus on
those issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Laura?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course the eugenics funding is in the budget, and
this eugenics funding conversation. This has been a sore spot between
the House and Senate for a couple of years, has anything changed? Will
we see this come through in the conference report?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, we are going to do our best. And the Speaker may
want to speak to that a little bit later when he comes up. Mr.Kent?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] my questions as well. Where that ranks on the
priority of getting things done, a bargaining chip that will fall out by
the wayside down a way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think generally speaking, they are almost done
in this state. Unfortunately, there is no way for those living victims
to receive compensation for that in the court system. What the provision
essentially does is afford individuals who are still alive, who are
victims of some rather heinous liberal policies, to be compensated.
Other questions on the vote?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In regards to supplement for teachers who have
advanced degrees, could you explain? It sounds like there might be some
confusions. Is that totally maintained? Is that changed? Is it different
from the Senate's doing away with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House budget continues to supplement for those
teachers that go through the National Board Certification process. We
will be discontinuing the supplement for Master's degrees. We've had a
difficult time and, fact is, nearly an impossible time getting data to
support teaching outcomes as a result of advanced degrees versus that
hands on experience one gets with National Board Certification. Laura?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was struck by the budget provision that gave almost
a half a million dollars [??EEFMT] to expand the charter schools in
rural areas. I'm wondering if you're interested in also setting up a
charter school board, but wouldn't that be the job of the charter school
board to the [??] charters in rural areas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Wait a minute with Chairman Horn to comment on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As you know, there are a number of very rural
communities, rural LEAs throughout our state. And often, those LEAs are
really not enough people that can easily come together to possibly look
at or form a charter school option. So this is some money that will help
them get organized...</p>
