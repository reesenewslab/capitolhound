and then how this might be different if the bill passes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We also have the Public Staff here if you would ask them questions but I
can give an overview. The Public Staff was created by the General
Assembly in the 70's to represent the using and consuming public before
the commission. So they can intervene, they can bring matters before the
commission. I believe, as Representative Cleveland was describing
before, they also give technical and other guidance to anyone who
appears before the commission and then they also intervene on behalf of
complainants and give consumer assistance to individuals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I would like to hear from the Public Staff themselves, so how would
that, what I think I hear you saying is almost like, me as the public,
they are my voice in front of the Utilities Commission. So how would
this bill make that different?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that may be more directly asked to the bill sponsor about his
intentions but I believe that it would reinforce the idea that they
represent the using and consuming public. I think the PCS has tried to
address concerns that this would limit them in their current scope of
action.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. I've heard what I think his intent is. The problem I have is
when I read it I'm not sure that that's what it does. So that's why I
was asking staff, based, because you all are the ones that draft it and
oversee it, what does it actually do. I think he stated what his intent
is but what does it actually do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, we do have the Public Staff, we'll give three
minutes after questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill states the Public Staff shall not give any advice, guidance, or
opinion in any proceeding or other matter before the commission that is
not in the interest of the using and consuming public. Presently the
Public Staff, and I'll quote, well I won't do that, presently the Public
Staff does not do that. Their focus is not on the using and consuming
public. Their focus is on what they think is legislative or
administrative intent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But the legislators are elected by the consuming public and so, I guess,
I would have thought that just as I'm a representative of my district
here if I write, if we pass laws here for the interest of our
constituents and they're trying to figure out what we intended, which we
did for the interest of our constituents, why would that not be
representing the public?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've been here long enough, and I think you have, to know that many
things get passed in the General Assembly that are not really in the
interest of the consuming and using public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, well, a couple of things. One, I worked, in a former life, I
worked three and a half years doing personnel at Commerce and during
that time I worked rather extensively with the Public Staff, they were
one of the agencies in the department. And I really, and I&quot;ll just
say this now and I don't say this piece of it as a reflection on the
bill, per se, but they were extremely professional and extremely
proficient. They were one of the best groups that I worked with and I'd
had problems with certain divisions and agencies, Public Staff wasn't
one of them. They were one of the ones that had their stuff together,
they were, they had a very high and commendable, and I hope this is
still the case, but at the time they had a very high and commendable
threshold for employee performance that was very beneficial. But, so
I'll step off of that and ask this question because I'm still kind of at
a loss at exactly what we are getting at. I personally think the Public
Staff's done a pretty good job over the years, at least that's been my
observation. But in line 18 where it says, &quot;Public Staff shall not
give any advice, guidance, or opinion in a proceeding or other matter
before the commission that is not int he interest of the using and
consuming public,&quot; who is going to make the determination that some
piece of advice, guidance, or opinion that is on a matter or a
proceeding before the commission is not in the interest of the, I mean,
who's going to make that judgement? Who's going to sit and say,
&quot;Ah, you said this, this,&quot; I mean, is it just going to be
folks' opinion of their opinion? Who governs that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the beginning of your statement, the comments you made are true, in
the Public Staff I have no problem with their efficiency, competency, or
anything else. They are extremely good at what they do and</p>

<p id="05:00">
I'm sure that they will fall below and if we tell them that you have to
strictly work in the interest using the consuming public I have
confidence that's exactly what they'll I have no problems with the
manner in which the public staff as perform the duties my problem is
there represented other physicians and using in considering stand
Follow-up  Mr. so you are saying that with this will be a self-governing
matter from understanding it correctly but further can you give us know
forefather examples of where they has they if the standard had been in
place that they would have been in violation of the I can think of to
tout my character I personally have been involved in an and not think it
is in the details I could do that but it was tumescence as I get
involved in that I mean they were not representing the consuming and
using public they were doing as they say they were too following
legislative intent intent and doing what they thought the legislature
100% recall question but were not privileged to the examples the first
one was about 45 years ago and it did involve some feet racing that they
were doing what's in my estimation several others probably many others
was not an interest in using it in consuming public and the latest one
was when intent when energy hearings as a help is about thank you to the
chair concern here is the the year the interest of using in consuming
public is a subjective what I consider to be in the the interest of the
general public and what someone else might consider could be two
entirely different things in the we give you were an example the
promotion of conservation for instance might be considered by some to be
a positive and in the interest of the general public and somebody else
might not consider that to be something that should be pursued that the
support of the diversity in the and innovation in generation capacity if
for is to shoot you were to take of you of you that what we are using
now let's say that all of our generation capacity right now is
coal-fired and that the because is coal-fired it's a each cheaper then a
mix that will have some natural gas fired of baseline generations atomic
plants with baseline generations some solar plants that that that mix
might produce a higher rate for instance that if we state will hold the
problem might be the state would call we got all the that would work for
the old ways as we move to the to the mix it may cost us a little bit
more but will be healthier and that consideration by the public staff in
its comments wrist is Enrique's under the existing legislation I think
it is appropriate and something we can begin of them but I'm not sure
what happens with the bill that you are proposing whether or not it it
number one changes anything because of the subjective nature of the
definition or if he changes it in such a way that some of the other
considerations are being precluded so I guess that's a very long whereas
the question are you tempting to preclude</p>

<p id="10:00">
These other considerations from the public staff when it makes a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No I am not. If the public staff in their
deliberations [AUDIO DROPS], and the work they do, they consider all
these things. And if in the mix of things it works for the using and
consuming public that's fine and dandy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dockum [SP].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I don't mean to belabor the
point Representative Cleveland but just to kind of follow up on
representative Dollar and I too have always heard excellent reports on
the public staff. To give an example of say Representative Hamilton and
I form a group, say Hamilton and Dockum [SP] for better electric rates.
And we want to come before the utilities commission to advocate for that
but we need help that we're an official group or entity here that's
stated in the bill, help me here, are you saying that the public staff
could not help us with out argument or give us legal advice?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding is that an issue has to be before the
public staff and if you have an issue before the public staff then they
can assist you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This would not necessarily be before the public staff
it would be before the utilities commission and we would solicit help
from the public staff to make our point. Are you...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not trying to preclude that at all, no
Representative Luebke, and I'd like to make it perfectly clear again I
have no qualms, doubts, or anything else about the efficiency,
competency and the professionalism of the public staff. They do an
excellent job. But I'd like them to represent the use and consuming
public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Commission, Chairman, well, representative Cleveland,
what you just said I don't know why we have this bill. Because...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well if you, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, let representative Luebke finish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess it's a question but then I'd like to continue
with some comments. But first of all, no, why do we have this bill if
what you just said you don't question the professionalism, you don't
have any problems with the kinds of information they provide the
utilities commission. Given what you just said why would you want to
just withdraw your bill at this point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me read something that was sent to me some time
ago in an email from a public staff, a member of the public staff. And
it says the public staff does not have the right to advocate positions
contrary to mandates passed by the general assembly, nor would it
presume to do so. And I go back to my original  statement, their
representing legislative intent or the administrations desires. Their
charge is to represent the using and consuming public and that's the
rationale for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm thinking about the public staff. I remember the
public staff was established by governor Hunt or governor Hunt
recommended it to the general assembly in 1977, and the language you use
now, the using, consuming public was at the heart of that recommendation
and went into place. I'm just saying and you can interject if you
disagree with me but recently the public staff negotiated with Progress
Energy and as a result of their negotiations Progress Energy dropped its
recommendation or its request by 50%. I don't have the numbers, I don't
have the time to dig them out this morning but they ended up saying,
okay, we agree, we'll only ask for 50% of what we originally had. So
they went forward to the utilities commission which is the decision
maker you referenced a moment ago, public staff charging fees, public
staff doesn't do that. Progress Energy went to the utilities commission
with only half the request in terms of dollars taken form peoples
pockets and industries pockets than what they were going to do. Now if
that isn't representing the using and consuming public I don't know what
is. So my question is what's wrong here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well my first response would be if I were looking for
an increase in cost I would look for the highest amount I could find and
hope for some baseline someplace. And my second response to the second
portion of your statement is the public staff I am not personally
aware...</p>

[0:00:00.0]
…Of anytime that the commission has changed any public staff
recommendation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if I may just one more thing Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just say that if the public staff currently have with private energy
one, that’s tremendous service on behalf of the using and consuming
public whether it’s households or it’s industry. So, it’s hard you to
examples are not that all persuasive to me that they are not acting on
behalf of the public, they make reservations, they make recommendations
to the commission, commission is not required by law to accept their
recommendations it’s for them to consider. The Governor Hunt put it in
abdicated for this in 1977 right after he was elected in 1976 because he
felt that the public wasn’t represented well enough on the Utilities
Commission that the Utilities Commission probably had a bias in favor
with the companies and the Governor wanna to provide some kind of
balance. I think the public staff agree with the ___[01:06] that I think
over the years they provided that balance and it’s a wonderful thing.
So, I can’t support your bill and other members will not support as
well, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think my question is already been ask someone I was just having little
trouble to understanding exactly what the bill does and one of your
sponsors you said that if the public staff goes through deliberations
and considers everything then they can still go ahead with these
hearings so they work everything and one example you gave of a violation
that passed was when energy hearings, I think Representative Dollar
already ask the question but I didn’t quite understand what the answer
was and the future for example say that the public staff consider
everything and they decided that it was in the public interest to have
more wind energy hearings. Who will tell them they were in violation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess if someone wants to take them to court and tell they were in
violation they could do with that, who tells them they were in violation
or not? So, the question is…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland from my understanding what you are trying to do
with this bill is just ____[02:42] the original mission of the public
staff not necessarily change their role but ___ what their original
intention was and am I correct what I’m saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I want them to focus on using and consuming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, you are not trying to change this entity at all you are just trying
to strengthen clarify language to help and conduct their mission more
effectively.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You could say that I wanna refocus and it’s really are representing the
using and consuming public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar and Representative Warn looking to public staff
Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well, the couple of things, one I’m little bit confused about
the legislative intent because from the memo that you had if they are
supposed to follow legislative intent like every other agency unless I’m
missing something here now. It may have been legislative intent from a
prior legislature that I would disagree with but if that’s the case then
it’s my obligation to say, “Okay, I’m open to bill and I’m gonna change
that legislative intent.” That’s just my observation but otherwise we
try to get, we usually get more problems with agencies not following
legislative intent than actually following the legislative intent. The
other thing was I’m not sure about the comments of Governor Hunt but I
do know that the public staff and they can correct me if I have got this
wrong, when they were constituted and as they develop they basically
sort of handling the negotiations and all these complex cases. And they
have the financial and legal firepower basically in that group to handle
those negotiations and I believe Representative Dockham was talking
about they interact with whether it’s utilities, ___ [04:56] General’s
Office or the lawyers…

All the various ?? parties in a rate case most of the time trying to
negotiate a proposal to in most cases keeping us out of superior court
with these matterw which I think is a very good thing for us. I would
have one question for you along that line and that is have there been
any of the utility companies or the attorney general's office or the
many user groups or folks that work with the public staff on a regular
basis that have come forward and expressed a concern? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The only concerns that I have received was when I filed my initial bill
and they were concerned about not being able to work with the public
staff and that was the reason for the PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But in terms of bringing
the bill forward, that was not as a result of concerns from those groups
saying this needs to be changed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just
wanted to ask the bill sponsor if he would consider tabling the bill and
maybe recalendaring it when we have a little more clarification for the
purpose of the bill and maybe an opportunity to provide a little more
background for the basis of the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Cleveland. Jim Cleveland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will withdraw the bill at
this time and we will recalendar it later. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Since the
public staff is here I'd like for you guys to just be patient for 3
minutes, let the public staff speak. Mr. Gruber, you're recognized for a
period not to exceed 3 minutes. Please introduce yourself. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Robert Gruber, and I've been Executive Director for almost 30
years. Before that I was counsel to the Utilities Commission. I want to
say that I think our staff has gratified by Representative Dollar's
remarks and I think we've tried to be professional over the years and I
think it's clear that we've, I've never heard anybody say that we acted
in a political fashion at the behest of any administration. I was
appointed in 1989 by Governor Jim Martin and I don't believe he regrets
that appointment. We have our, we're supposed to represent the public
interest, you're right, that's not always clear what it is. We do the
best we can from reading the statute and making interpretations of the
statute. There's a policy section of the statute that lays out the
policies of the state. There's also a statute if you want to, 6215,
which is very detailed about what the public staff's duties are and it's
very clear that we, what our duties are and that's to do our best to
represent the using and consuming public in all these matters. I'm a
little, some people have said well this bill doesn't do anything, but
I'm afraid that if you add language to a bill at some point lawyers are
going to argue under statutory construction principles that it does mean
something and it could lead to vagueness about how we're supposed to
proceed and what our responsibilities are so I'm, maybe at this point
it'd be, if you'd like, Mr. Chairman, I could answer any questions
anyone might have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any questions for Mr.
Gruber. Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have one. I'll ask
you the same question I asked staff. If this bill passes what will the
change be for you because some were saying well it's just clarifying
language, some seem to think it's doing the opposite, it's unclarifying
the language, so if this were to pass can you anticipate how you would
see it impacting what you all do? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Gruber. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It's not clear and I guess that's the problem. It's not clear
what changes it would cause and I guess you all have heard many of you
say many times if it's not broke don't fix it, and I don't know exactly
what the problem the bill's trying to</p>
