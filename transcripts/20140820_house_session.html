Committees and permanent sub-committees, Representative Moore is
recognized to send forth the committee report, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative T. Moore, Chair, Rules, count [??] and
operation of the house committee report, senate bill 729, [??]
management act of 2014, recommend that the house do adopt the conference
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Calendar without objection for today's calender?
representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to make his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker I move that senate
bill three which was the Jay Mack [SP] modification bill, at least the
version we would eventually be considering, be recalled from the clerks
office and placed on the calender for immediate consideration. And I
would be asked to, be recognized to debate the motion please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, this is senate bill three, I've spoken to the
democratic caucus today, I've spoken to the republican caucus. I think
most all members are in the loop on what this is about but I in
abundance of caution want to make sure that everyone knows what this is.
Many of you may recall we received senate bill three several weeks ago
from the senate and it was the clean Jay Mack [SP] bill. The Jay Mack
that was one of the provisions in 1224 yesterday but it's also a
provision that's been approved by a wide margin in another bill that we
did. What that does, that is designed to save the jobs for the evergreen
project up in Western North Carolina. That's the power plant that has
been required by the EPA to make all these upgrades and so forth, and
there are real concerns that the plant may leave the state, if it does
so it's a - leave a paper facility and it's been there for many many
years.
This is the first of a number of procedural motions if the house would
indulge and would grant it, that would allow this bill to be back before
the body to be acted upon. By going this route we would be essentially
be going back to the second version that came to us, version two, the
version that came to us form the senate allowing us to adopt that
version and then simply having it ratified by both bodies, go to the
governor, would not require any further action on the part of the
senate. We have concurred with the senate and they understand that we
are doing this today also.
It is vitally important I think as the members form Western North
Carolina spoke on it yesterday to that region of the state, but we have
a series of procedural votes we need to go through to simply have the
bill before us. I would ask the body to vote with us on the procedural
votes and then at some point today we will taker a recess, the rules
committee will review the bill again to give it an appropriate view in
committee and then it would be added to the calendar for this afternoon
later in the day. Mr. Speaker I'll be glad to answer any questions if
there are any, otherwise I would ask the body for support in this
motion. And there will be other motions to follow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the motion? If
not the question before the house is the motion sent forth by
representative Moore for the house committee substitute of senate bill
three. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no, the clerk will open
the vote. The clerk allot machine record the vote, 97 having voted in
the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes. Representative
Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an additional motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker Ii move that the house suspend the rules
to allow a motion to reconsider the vote on the third reading of senate
bill three with that vote having occurred more than one legislative day
prior to today. Again that Mr. Speaker if I may be allowed to debate the
motion briefly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just briefly. Representative Cunningham, does the lady
wish to be recorded on the prior vote?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Recorded as yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has been recorded as yes. The gentleman has
the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again this is just another one of the procedural
votes, I appreciate your affirmative vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the
question before the house is the motion to suspend the rules for
consideration of the house committee substitute, reconsideration of the
house committee substitute for senate bill three. All in favor vote aye,
all opposed vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk allot

the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes. House bill 729
the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To the president of the senate, the speaker, house
representatives, this conference report to solve the difference between
the senate and the house representatives on senate bill 729 bill to be
entitled the company has recommended that the senate and the house
representatives adopt this report, conference [??] for the senate,
senate Apodaca Chair, senators Berger and Wade confluence [??] of the
house, representative McGrady Chair, representative Hager and Moffett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair recognizes that a darned important member
for this bill is out of the chamber, we'll be at ease until we find
Representative, oh, there representative McGrady is. Representative
McGrady the gentleman is recognized for a motion and then to debate the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion I believe I guess is to accept the
conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To adopt the conference report. The motion is properly
before us, the gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I was in support of the conference report,
I chaired the conference committee and I'm proud to say that all the
conferees on the conference committee for the house have come together
to sport the bill. This was a bipartisan committee, unfortunately
representative Samuelson and Representative Glazier are not here today
but both of them have communicated their support for the bill and both
were critical actually in getting us to where we are. I'm intending only
to go over five points with respect to this bill. There are a lot of
different issues in the bill and differences between the senate and the
house, but there were only really five that had some prominence. Note I
didn't say they were important, I just said they were had some
prominence 'cause I think some of them are actually not that important
in terms of passage of the bill.
I would want to note though what we're doing here again. This is the
first in the nation effort to address the coal ash management, coal ash
issue. No other state has undertaken what we're undertaking today. We
had no model to use to come up with the bill and that's why it took the
time it did. It's a very long bill and given that the amount of time
it's taken us to get where we are with respect to coal ash, some of
these coal ash ponds are decades old and some of them nearly a century
old. Frankly it shouldn't be unexpected that it took us several months
to get to the point where we have agreement as between the house and the
senate. What I really like about the bill is it recognizes that there's
no one size fits all option here. We've got different coal ash ponds in
different parts of the state and they each need to be dealt with in
different ways. A coal ash pond...</p>

<p id="015:00">
In the mountains is very different than a coal ash pond sitting at, near
sea level down in a bunch of water. And they really need to be looked at
separately. Moreover, we couldn't come up with one solution here. If we
wanted to dig them all up and put them in landfills, we do not have
enough landfill space to do that. This requires a multifaceted approach.
There are gonna be some of these coal ash ponds that are dug up and put
in landfills. And that's what's gonna happen. There are gonna be some of
these coal ash ponds that the ash is used for beneficial purposes, for
structural fill. I suspect there are gonna be some of these coal ash
ponds where the coal ash, when dried, will actually be burned again so
that the coal ash has the chemical composition that could be used in
cement. And I'm just saying this because there are various things that
need to be done, and I think the bill is really important because it
recognizes a one size does not fit all. The bill is gonna lead to
specific plans on each one of these coal ponds, coal ash ponds. And once
the plans are in place, as a recommended initially by Duke, then
considered by DENR and ultimately approved by an independent third
party, the coal ash management commission, will have plans, will have a
prioritization, which ones need to be cleaned up first, and then this
will lead to the clean up of the coal ash ponds. I would tell you, I
think we're doing it in a cost efficient way. And I, most importantly as
I suggested, I think there are some new technologies that we need to
provide for because we do not have enough coal ash, enough landfills to
put all the coal ash that we've got in place. Bottom line for me, and
people know my background, at the end of the day if a pond is polluting
one's neighbor's land, that pond is gonna have to be cleaned up. We can
talk about compliance boundaries and all sort of technical issues, but
that's the simple truth here. If  you've got a pond that is polluting
your neighbor's land, those ponds are gonna have to be cleaned up. And I
wouldn't be supportive of this bill unless I knew this to be true. So
let me get to the five, and only five issues that I intend to touch on
unless others have questions. First, the moratorium. The Senate bill
initially had a moratorium that basically said that Duke Energy could
not recoup its costs through rates until January of next year. Meaning,
it can't begin a rate case. It doesn't mean that it gets decided right
then. That's when they can move forward. The House bill had a much later
date. In the conference bill we have gone with the House version. And
this is one of those issues that has some recognition but I frankly
don't view it as a very important issue. And the reason it's not
important is because we can come back next year and deal with the cost
issue. We made a decision not to deal with the cost issue in this bill.
If we had put the cost provision in this bill, we would not be cleaning
up these things because we'd still be talking about the cost issue.
These costs are not gonna be incurred until Duke starts cleaning them
up. And so, it is premature. And legal ?? this is not ripe yet for us to
take this issue. And if we took it, this issue, right now, we wouldn't
be moving forward with a bill that requires Duke to do what this bill
requires it to do. Secondly, the variance. The House has a provision
that allows the coal ash management commission, upon recommendation to
Duke, to move some of these dates. Now, Duke will tell you that these
dates are wildly aggressive, and they don't know if they can meet them
all. Well, that may be true. I don't wanna be in a position where they
meet most of them, and one pond is out there, and we don't have a way to
allow them, because every one of these ponds are very different, to
comply with the law. If, if they make the appropriate showing, they can
get a variance. And what is in this bill that's different than the one
we passed is I thought it was appropriate that some complained that the
variance, the variance provisions were sort of wide open. They can be
used over and over again, over some period of time. Which could mean, in
theory, that something didn't get cleaned up.</p>

<p id="020:00">
And so the variance provision has been tightened, And I would direct you
to page 26, lines 35 through 40, where the tightening has occurred. So
in this position, the senate compromised with us in putting the variance
provision in and we compromised with the Senate in terms of making sure
that it couldn’t be liberally used. The next issue is the location of
the new Coal Ash Management Commission. The House bill housed the Coal
Ash Management Commission at Deener. The senate bill housed the Coal Ash
Management Commission at the Division of Emergency Management of the
Department of Public Safety. The conference bill goes with the senate
version. And there’s a good reason for that. I think we need to
recognize that there is a federal criminal investigation going on right
now. And the Senate’s argument was that we need to put this thing
somewhere right now, somewhere other than at Deener. Deener does not
have the credibility right now, perhaps. And so let’s set it up in a
neutral site. If we set it up right, and it starts running. This is
going to be here for a good number of years. We can always move it over
to Deener when a lot of this other stuff gone on. We acceded to the
Senate position with respect to the location of the new Coal Ash
commission.
The next two issues are the ones that probably have gotten the most
public discussion in defining what the low priority site is is the issue
that, in fact, was what caused the break down in all of our negotiations
with the Senate. If you look at pages 20 and 21, particularly on page 21
lines 4 through 10. That language is where the disagreement was. If you
remember back when we debated this bill on the floor, many of you put
forward amendments seeking to add this site, or that site, to the list
of high priority sites. And the reason people were doing that is because
they didn’t want this other Coal Ash pond to be capped in place. Well,
we have gotten to that issue. The ? has heard you. And we believe that,
in fact, most of the Coal Ash ponds that are out there are not going to
be capped in place. But to assure you of that, we wanted to reflect in
the low priority criteria that fact. And the key issue here is, as a
general matter, a Coal Ash pond that is sitting in water and water
capable of running through it. No matter what comes in at the top. You
can put a cap on it. Sitting in water, is not going to be capped in
place, unless there is a technology that precludes that pollution from
moving on to your neighbor’s property. And again, I could get more
detailed here talking about compliance boundaries and what not. But the
fact is that were trying to clearly say to everyone that there are Coal
Ash ponds that are not appropriate to be capped in place. And most of
those frankly are the ones that you tried to move forward and most of
them are along the coast because the water table is pretty close to what
these ponds are at. And we were insistent and frankly we brought down
the General Assembly over our insistence on this provision. For me, this
is the single most reason to support the bill. It strengthens the bill
in ways that we wanted to get there. And its based on the science. It’s
based on Deener telling us that they do not believe that a pond that is
sitting in the water table ought to be capped in place as a general
matter.
And finally the last issue is the compliance boundary. The compliancy
boundary issue we debated at great length. I wish Representative Glazier
was here, he can better explain it than me actually. But the conference
bill is the House position. So we’ve been through this before. We have
takes the House position. Basically it does reverse a Superior Court….</p>

<p id="025:00">
Decision related to the compliance boundary, which in my opinion, and
the opinion of many Republican lawyers, was wrongly decided. That gets
me back to why I wanted a Democratic lawyer on my conference committee.
And I charged Representative Glazier to look at this thing, and he and I
worked on it, and we tried to see if there was some other fix here, and
in the end we didn't, he was of the view, as was I previously, that the
superior court decision was wrongly decided and the appropriate thing
for us to do, since we are the ones that determine what the law is, was
to fix it, and fix it now. This is the only piece of the coal ash bill
that has application beyond coal ash. It would relate to municipal
landfills. It would relate to municipalities that spray their wastewater
on land. You have other compliance boundaries, so this is a, actually a
bigger issue than just the coal ash. But we have voted on this, and this
position is a House position, and despite what you might have heard in
the press, being criticized for our position on the compliance boundary,
I will tell you the Senate insisted upon the House position on the
compliance boundary. This was not something we negotiated at great
length with the Senate. This is where they were. So that is the
explanation of the five big points. There's a lot more there. I, mister
Speaker, I didn't ask, but I assume I can have staff on the floor with
me, since they're already here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's been sort of implied for about 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's what I figured. And so, if there are other questions I'll try to
respond to them, but I'm gonna, I'll stop right there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That, ladies and gentlemen, because of a rules committee meeting and
other matters and providing you all with some time for lunch, we are
gonna carry this debate on to noon. If we have sufficient time, we will
take a vote. Otherwise, we will continue to debate when we reconvene at
2pm. Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative McGrady would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There's much in your presentation that I find to be very positive. One
thing however troubles me, and that's, my constituents have been
concerned that in the fall out of all of this that they're going to end
up as rate pairs, having to, as they say, tote the note. And in an
earlier iteration of this, there was a moratorium that would have
extended to sometime in the next legislative session in order to give
this general assembly the opportunity to weigh in on that issue. That
moratorium seems to have kind of vanished in the bill that's in front of
us until I think January. And so I was wondering, since it's somewhat of
a long bill and I might have missed something, what assurances can you
give me for my constituents that won't be left whole in the bag.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, responding to your question, the moratorium language is on page
three. The change is simply between the dates. You are right in
characterizing the moratorium as being in place until January 15th of
next year. We come into session shortly thereafter. If Duke applies for
a rate increase based on its cost for cleaning up coal ash ponds, any
legislator here would be able to introduce legislation like the
following week. And as we all need to recognize, I assume these rate
pieces go on for some period of time. I am, I am, I would bet my house
on the fact that if we want to take up the cost issue, we can do it next
time. As to the substance of what you were asking, I would ask, I would
suggest that this isn't in one of those issues that is neither one way,
all one way or the other way. In instances where Duke has been negligent
in its handling of coal ash, my view would be that those costs have to
be borne by Duke and the shareholders. But I feel like we also need to
recognize that we're, right as we're standing here, I'm standing here
now,</p>

<p id="030:00">
We are generating electricity using coal and the cost of the coal that
we're currently using in the disposal of that ash is not, in my opinion,
appropriately the shareholders of Duke. That's the rate payers. That's
the cost of doing electricity so I think this is going to be a situation
that the General Assembly may want to weigh into. We wouldn't have a
bill if we weigh into it now, there's just no way. The issue is way too
complicated and it's not read right. They haven't incurred the cost
necessary to put forward a rate case and therefore we, when we come back
next year, and I may even work on a bill related to the rate, we can
take that up and we'll have plenty of time to do it. I can't assure you
what we'll do or what the public utility commission will do, but my
personal view is that there's a sweet spot somewhere in the middle here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is
recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. I did want to ?? the House I did want to give a lot of credit
to our colleagues Representative Hager and ?? and Callan and Millis and
you Mr. Speaker and especially Representative McGrady for the leadership
on this issue as our Representative McGrady our state has dealt with
this issue including the state of Tennessee that experienced a billion
gallon spill in December of 2008 so I think this is a good step for our
state to be taking and I heard in rurals that discussion about the lack
of federal regulations. I think the feds have been trying to work on
this but have been prevented by pressure by Congress but we might have a
federal rule but in the meantime I think it's important for North
Carolina to act on coal ash. It's a very toxic substance. It's got all
kinds of carcinogens and ?? in it and we have known cancer clusters
around some of these coal ash ponds so this is a real public health
problem so I'm glad we're addressing it. I just wish this were a
stronger bill. I have a couple of problems with it and I'll be brief.
One relates to the cost and the other relates to the compliance boundary
language. I think just as this body did in the clean smoke stacks debate
I think we could make the policy determination that this cost is not
going to be born by the rate payers of North Carolina. We heard in the
environmental review commission that the cost to clean up could be as
much as 10 billion dollars and that would translate to 20 to 30 dollars
a month on the power bills of our constituents. I heard from my
constituents when I was knocking on doors in May that this was just
unacceptable to them. We know that the public is very anxious about the
cost of this not being born by the rate payers and I appreciate
Representative McGrady's point about Duke being negligent. I think a lot
of people feel like the fact that these ponds have been leaking toxins
and contaminants into our waterways for decades is some display of
negligence but it's going to be a future determination. The other
problem I have with this bill relates to the undermining of Judge
Ridgeway's decision. Judge Ridgeway ruled that existing law required
clean up of the source of the contamination in these coal ash ponds and
what this bill is going to do is undermine that decision. I think that
that was a very important ruling that protected the public health as
citizens of North Carolina so for those two reasons because the cost
issue and because of the reversing the Judge Ridgeway decision I'm going
to encourage you to vote no on the motion. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Grier Martin please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the motion. Representative Martin I will add that we're going to
end at noon so you can continue it over if we have to come back at 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I read it Mr. Speaker that I may be the only thing
standing between the body and lunch. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members
first of all I think it's clear that the bill before you represents a
great deal of really good work by folks on both sides of the aisle
particularly the gentleman from Henderson. I think we've got to this
point really for two reason. One is that we have a horror story. We've
seen what happens now to our citizens, to the people of North Carolina,
when we have some of those spills. But you can take a horror story and
it'll just lie there if you don't have folks like the gentleman from
Henderson and many other who have been apart of this to get it to this
point. In the end though in spite of all the good work and the many good
provisions in this, it's the cost issue that is the sticking point for
me. That now having seen the horrors of a coal ash spill in North
Carolina I can't now vote for a bill that I have to go back and tell my
North Carolinians leaves them still at risk for a coal ash spill and
also may stick them for the bill of the clean up so for those reasons
and with great respect to the gentleman from Henderson and all the folks
who have worked for this, I will be voting no. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

<p id="035:00">
members, I agree that this is a much better bill and I applaud the work
that's been done on it. There's a provision here that, for me, is not
acceptable and I also agree with Representative Grady that the capping
in place of provision has been improved greatly. But all of these sites,
maybe with the exception one or two, all of these sites are currently
leaking contaminants and capping is not going to stop that leaking. My
parents have a piece of property in California that is a superfund site,
it's contaminated with hexavalent chromium. It may be in the cleanup
process for decades. So when something like this happens it can affect
multiple generations and be a danger, a health danger, and I just think
that this is too weak and that we could do better. So I'll be voting no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate your response to questions so far and your explanation of
the five key points. On one of them, the defining the low-priority
sites, I, is, whenever you make the determination that if the coal ash
is in water and there will not be any pollution going beyond the site to
some other property owner and so forth that you could indeed cap that in
place. I understand that to be the case?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But if there was-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, excuse me, Mr. Speaker. If there was pollution going to a
neighboring site and issues then this bill says that that coal ash will
be removed and not capped in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill says that if the pollution crosses the compliance boundary,
which may or may not be the border of the property, that the, in this
case Duke Energy, is going to have to stop any pollution continuing to
cross the compliance boundary. This comes back, Representative Queen,
to, it's going to really have two choices. If it is, if Duke's coal ash
residuals are leaking into, past the compliance boundary, one of the
options it's going to have is to be dig it all up and move it somewhere
else or dig it all up and put down a liner and put it all back. The
other possibility, though, is a different type of cap in place. You
could, in theory, put pressure outside the compliance boundary that
pushes that polluted, dirty water back to the pond in which it came. In
theory, there could be something that you put in the pond that would
attract those pollutants, those toxic metals, or whatever. And so I'm
guarded in response to you because it's a very important question but
the answer is complex. My guess is that, more often than not, the
solution is going to be dig up the coal ash pond and move it somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if the commission determines that this technology/solution might
be indeed viable, who determines the, is it a sustainable solution and
will it be monitored so that indeed it, I guess just monitored so indeed
the solution that was intended is sustainable, is that part of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, I would direct you to page 21, lines 4-10 and that
is the sum and substance of the answer to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you, is that yes or no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the responsibility lies ultimately</p>

With the coal ash management commission. But the language that was
critical to me was that if they're gonna use something other than
digging it up and putting down a liner and moving it somewhere, they had
to demonstrate, they had to design, they had to demonstrate that
whatever they were doing, was actually going to prevent that pollution
from moving. And again, that was, you have hit the, the heart of the
dispute that brought this bill nearly to an end several weeks ago.

inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the end of session it's like silly season
in NASCAR. You hear so many different things. Medicaid is a big issue
and I reckon my question to you: do you foresee us coming back dealing
with medicaid and/or possibly incentives later down the road? I know
things go around the chamber and go around. Do you foresee that? I know</p>

[Speaker changes.]...the governor but I mean you are the Speaker of the
House, do you anticipate...foresee...anything to that effect?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Ray????????, just speaking candidly, I
do think that there were some matters in 12-24 that the governor and the
Secretary of Commerce have expressed grave concern about the potential
impact on some immediate opportunities.  I am not the Governor nor would
I pretend to know what he is thinking but it would be logical given
the...some of the imminent situation related to the
negative...potentially negative outcomes of that bill failing yesterday
that it is within his power to call us back to a special session. I'm
not certain that he would do that. There will not be any
call...obviously constitutionally with the appropriate number of members
could call ourselves back but the only adjournment resolution that the
House was willing to accept was one that does not have a provision for a
special session. I find it highly unlikely that we would call ourselves
back for that purpose.  I find it highly likely that in the
interim...that there will be a lot of progress made on trying to address
Medicaid reform but that would most likely be a matter that would be
taken up under another Speaker and another session.
[Speaker changes.] Point of personal privilege?
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Well, ladies and gentlemen...for the freshman
especially...this is a...we're goin' home folks.  We had a member that
was on our side of the aisle, Larry ???????????, that he always wore his
purple suit at the end of session and so...some of our members here have
purple on so ladies and gentlemen, I hope you have a good safe trip home
and, in honor of my friend and one of my passed colleagues, Larry
??????????????, purple's for him. Thank you. (Applause.)
[Speaker changes.]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm also pleased to report
that our friend and colleague, Representative Jeter, is doing well tho'
I think he had been ill overnight and was seriously dehydrated and we
expect him to be released from the hospital today and get him back up to
the energetic level we all like to know and love him by.  Representative
McGrady, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Point of personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, I just rise to thank publicly a large
number of people who worked on a very difficult bill. Representatives
Hager, Samuelson and I started with this bill, joined by Representative
Catlin and then a host of others...Representative Millis...and it's been
a long road, and, as I indicated earlier,  it's been one where I've
tried to be very collaborative and so Representative Harrison,
Representative Glazier among others have made some significant
contributions. It was funny at one point, the Senate was upset because
there was language in one of the Democrats' bills that looked peculiarly
like my language and the reason that was was it was my language. I was
working to try to build...let's say a car....all on the same platform
and so I worked collaboratively with Senator Apodaca and the Senate bill
was more language of mine than they would probably be willing to concede
and we ended up in a good place. I wanna particularly thank you, Mister
Speaker.  Despite what a range of television ads have said, you,
throughout this whole process have had my back, and, at any one point,
you could've cut a deal that was something other than where I wanted to
get us. As recently as Sunday night while I was getting on a plane to
come back here, thinking I wasn't going to have a bill but we have a
bill. We have a bill because of some really good work by a number of my
colleagues and the support of my leadership.  I just wanna thank you for
that.
[Speaker changes.] Notices and announcements?  We are gonna take up the
adjournment resolution...I'm just trying to take care of any other
remaining business before hand. Representative Cunningham, please state
your purpose
[Speaker changes.] Point of personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] The lady is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker. I wanted you all to know</p>

Left here that this session has truly been a challenge. But I also want
to remind you that the Suicide Resolution passed in this House
unanimously. And I really appreciate the bipartisan support on that
issue. It went to the Senate, and it sat in the Senate Health Committee,
because I followed it. But do believe, when we return here, you will see
another Suicide Resolution that will be presented in this House in the
next session. Thank you all. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Pittman,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Moment of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized for a point of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I want to say in
front of everybody that, although that you and I have disagreed on some
things long away, I do admire your grasp of ?? things and your
leadership ability. And I do believe you have done some very good things
here. And I believe if you get to go to Washington, you'll do some good
things there. And may God bless you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative
Brandon, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Moment of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Gentleman is recognized for a point of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Since we're being bipartisan, I do
want to make sure that I would like to stand up and say how much it has
been an honor to serve under you, Mr. Speaker. We have made a lot of
music together. We have made people together. But I wanted to let you
know that I've had many bosses and I've had many people that I have been
under their leadership. And it has been a tremendous honor to have
worked under you. You have been tremendously fair and have never lied to
me. Everything that you said that you were going to do, you did. I
never, ever had to worry about you saying something to me and I had to
worry about it not being true later. That is what a true leader is. We
don't always agree politically, but I think you're a tremendous servant,
and the state of North Carolina is better because of your service. And I
appreciate you for it. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Moore
will take up the Resolution, and we will do the adjournment. And thank
you for those comments, Representatives Pittman and Brandon. House Joint
Resolution 1276 The Clerk will read it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senate
Committee ?? House Joint Resolution 1276. A joint resolution ?? for the
adjournment sine die of the 2013 regular session of the General
Assembly. The House resolves, the Senate concurring. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Moore is recognized to debate the Resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you. Mr. Speaker, members, a lot of folks have
been waiting for a long time for this one. This is the Adjournment
Resolution to send us home. This would be the Sine Die Resolution, which
would mean the session is over for this year. A lot of times we have a
ceremony, if the Senate is in session and we're in session, where we
would open both of these doors, the bell would get rung, and Ms. Weeks
would drop a handkerchief. We thought we were out of handkerchiefs
because we've been here so long people have been crying, and they were
all dirty and they couldn't find any handkerchiefs. That one came from
Ray Starling, by the way. But we won't get to do the handkerchief drop,
because the Senate is not going to be in session until 7:00 tonight. But
the effect of this Resolution would be, once we adopt it we would then
thereafter come back in for the normal Adjournment motion that I would
make at the end of session. But it would be the Adjournment Sine Die and
we would vote on that. That is the plan. If I could just, sort of
debating the Resolution but sort of a moment of personal privilege if I
might, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized for a
point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I
want to echo some of the comments. I want to thank you, first off, for
the opportunity to serve as Rules Chair. We try not to mess up to much.
Every now and then some mistakes happen, but the Clerk tries to help
sometimes. I want to thank you for the leadership you've provided this
House these four years. I'm going to miss you. I know a lot of other
folks are. I certainly hope to see you on a larger stage doing bigger
and better things here in the coming months. But I wanted to take the
time to thank you, to thank Denise, to thank the Clerk staff, to thank
your staff for making this a very productive, maybe a little long, but a
very productive session. Thank you the honor of serving with you. And I
hope the members will join me in expressing our gratitude for your
service and also for the Clerk. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.</p>

Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Floyd would answer a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reluctantly, Mr. Speaker, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, are we hitting the red or the green button on this
one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If it's to leave it with Shelby it will be green.

Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the motion to concur in Senate Committee Substitute for House
Joint Resolution 1276. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine record the
vote, 95 having voted affirmative and none in the negative. The
resolution passes. Now, I know you think we're all done but we actually
have to adjourn. That will be ratified tonight. So the remaining matter
of business is one where, hopefully, we can convince Representative
Blust to vote with us. Representative Moore is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives, meeting in regular session of
the 2013 General Assembly has concluded the business for which it was
convened and I move that the House adjourn sine die subject to
ratification of bills and resolutions, messages from the Senate, and
pursuant to House Joint Resolution 1276.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore moves, seconded by Representative Stam, that the
House of Representatives, meeting in the regular session of the 2013
General Assembly adjourn sine die subject to ratification of bills and
resolutions, receipt of messages from the Senate, and pursuant House
Joint resolution 1276. Those in favor say aye. All opposed say no. The
aye's have it, the House stands adjourned. Ladies and gentlemen, the
motion carries. The message will be sent to the Senate that we adjourn
sine die.</p>
