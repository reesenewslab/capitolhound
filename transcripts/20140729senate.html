The Senate will come to order. The sergeant at arms will close the
doors. Members will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery
will please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer
is the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain, all members and guests
will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please pray with me. Lord, you're gracious to bring us together today
with all of our different stories and lives. You bring us into this
chamber to work together and Lord, you are the maker of all things. You
hold up creation. While all must change and no decay you are unchanging,
always new. You are our solace, you are our shield. You are our rock,
secure on which to build. You are the spirits' tranquil home and you
alone is our hope fulfilled. You, Lord Jesus, are the strength of our
living days and your loyalty endures forever. Your loyalty endures
forever. And we make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, the journal of Monday, July 28th, 2014 has been examined
and is found to be correct. I move that the Senate dispense with the
reading of the journal and that it stand approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection the journal for July 28th, 2014 is approved as
written. Members, leaves of absence for today are granted for Senators
Parmon, Van Duyn, Blue, and Curtis. Members, we have serving us today a
Nurse of the Day but I don't believe she's in the chamber. Nurse Ayanna
Whitfield from Winterville, North Carolina is our Nurse of the Day. If
she comes in the chamber later before we adjourn I will see that she's
recognized. Senator Barringer is recognized for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I request a moment of personal privilege to
send forward a Senatorial Statement out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor. Send forward your statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Today I stand to honor Thelma Zaytoun who has
been a loyal volunteer at Rex Hospital for the last 50 years. Mrs.
Zaytoun has volunteered more than 20,400 volunteer hours at Rex
Hospital, benefiting the patients, visitors, physicians and co-workers
as she unselfishly devotes her time and energy to service and
fundraising to the benefit of Rex Hospital. Mrs. Zaytoun supported the
establishment of the corner gift shop, which opened in 1980, and
assisted with the hospital's relocation from St. Mary's St. to Lake
Boone Trl., which included helping move new mothers and babies on buses
at 4:00 AM in the morning. In December of 1988, to commemorate their
45th wedding anniversary and to celebrate her love of nurses, Mrs.
Zaytoun and her husband, Joe, who's also with us today established the
Thelma K. Zaytoun Scholarship in Nursing Foundation which has helped
dozens of nurses at Rex Hospital further their education and improve
care at the hospital. Mrs. Zaytoun faithfully served Governors James B.
Hunt, Jr., Michael F. Easley, and Beverly E. Perdue on the North
Carolina Volunteerism and Community Service Commission and Mrs. Zaytoun
was awarded the highest North Carolina civilian honor, the Order of the
Long Leaf Pine on February 1st, 2005. She's a proud advocate and
supporter of Rex Hospital and shares her enthusiasm for the hospital,
its excellent care with coworkers, patients, and visitors. Mrs. Zaytoun,
you deserve recognition for your 50 years of outstanding volunteerism at
Rex Hospital. Thank you so much.
[APPLAUSE]
Senator Barringer, thank you for that. Members, one of the real
strengths of North Carolina is the volunteers we have in communities
across the state. Mrs. Zaytoun is an example, and a very fine example,
of what is best of North Carolina and upon the motion of Senator Tamara
Barringer of Wake County the Chair is happy to extend courtesies to Mrs.</p>

For about, probably til 2:30 if we could, and I'd like to ask the

Thank you mister President. Members, it's my pleasure today to present
Anna Spangler Nelson as our nominee for our Board of Governors to
complete the term by Fred Eshelman, who resigned about a week or so ago.

Senate ironically this bill came back to us from the House leaner than
it was when it left. All these provisions that are in this bill at this
point in time were in the bill went it left the Senate. There was one
provision that was in it that is not in it at this point in time. It is
probably appropriate that it not be there. I would recommend that we
concur so we can at least take care of this matter. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you Mr. President. Members, every provision in this report you
have seen and voted on out of this chamber once before with the
exception of the amend the horse industry promotion act and basically
what this did was change two little words but this language would allow
the horse industry promotion act to continue receiving the already
established referendum for feed that is being bought by horse owners and
I would ask that we adopt this amendment and I ask for your support and
a vote of yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Carrying
on, the question before the Senate is the adoption of the conference
report on second reading to House Bill 366.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 1133, Technical and Other Corrections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell's recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. I'd like to say that
when we see this bill come through that we know that we're close to at
least leaving sometime soon. We hope. The bill, as you can see, is
rather an extensive one, had a pretty good discussion about it in Rules
this morning. A couple things I'd like to point out, this is what went
into it, at least in terms of selections that came from lots of folks.
At least that's the paperwork I have. This book is the General Statutes
of North Carolina as they existed in 1943. I think I made the point.
It's really interesting reading if you go back to '43, which was even
before, wait never mind. What I would propose to do, Mr. President, I
would love to answer questions about it there. I would be glad to go
into nauseating detail about each and every section. We did have that
opportunity in Rules this morning. There were questions raised about
several sections. There were some pieces that were taken out at that
time. Some of which may be returned at some point in time. There were
some suggested amendments that are being drafted as we speak. We will
object to third reading, I will object to third reading on this bill at
this point in time, or when discussion is over, so that you can have
further opportunity to look at the base bill and that we can have,
hopefully, what will be a series of, or at least one, Omnibus amendment
to it. But with that, Mr. President, I have the detailed information on
each of these sections and I will be glad to try to go through each one
or, if members have questions, be glad to suggest, to try to answer
those. The bill is not entirely technical but it is pretty close. It is
technical clarifying, insofar as I'm aware there are no truly
contentious non-technical matters. At least, if they are contentious, we
have not located that contention as yet but I'll be glad to try to
answer any questions going through it. It is very, series of lots of
issues in the, trying to explain or go through each and every one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Hartsell will yield for a question or two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will and I expected no less.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, there were just a couple of things here which I was
seeking a little clarification. I wasn't in Rules this morning so they
may have been discussed there and if they have then I apologize to my
colleagues who were there. Let me ask you this, I had a question come up
to me about section 57, the revisions here that were proposed to be made
to the North Carolina Economic Development Partnership Modifications,
could you explain to me exactly what this particular modification would
accomplish?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I recall there were some of these sections that were removed in-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Were they?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
-in Rules this morning and that may have been one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This was section 57, I don't have the actual bill before me but I was
going through one of the detail legislative summaries that was
distributed this morning in Rules. If you don't have it available we can

?? I really quite quite sincerely, Mr. President, I would love to answer
your question but if it might be possible to defer that until tomorrow
because there were some sections that were removed and apparently this
may not have been removed. I’m just not sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up, Mr. Care?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, I ask if you would
yield for a follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
??Yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Likewise dealing with section 62 which
repeals the elimination of the dues kickoff?? for public school
employees. It makes a reference to an ?? ?? already permanently in??
enforcement of this probation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The section repeals the
statute that the courts have permanently enjoined enforcement of that
probation so we’re simply repealing it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So this would’ve been the language
that was put in in that midnight session a few years back that would’ve
eliminated those kickoffs? Is that what it is deleting or is it deleting
the capacity to provide for the kickoffs? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is
eliminating session law 2012 section, number 1. That’s what it does. For
whatever, you can characterize anything you want, but I’m just saying it
simply repeals that section that a court has permanently enjoined.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that explains it. Thank you Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Senator Bryant, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Hartsell a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell do you yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell I wanted to ask a question about section 18. I’m trying
to scroll to it now, that’s why I’m sitting down, Mr. President, I know
that’s not the right protocol. I’ll stand up ??. Can you tell me what
section 18 does, and if that’s technical or substantive or how is it
different from the current law? [SPEAKER CHANGES] My note is that it
corrects a citation from rule 29 to rule 24 of the rules of civil
procedure, to correct the citation itself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does it
expand— [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, a further question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does it expand the authority of the legislative officers in any
way? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s not designed to, it simply corrects the
citation, to make it the appropriate citation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One
more follow up, Mr.— [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a moment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield and let me simply say, confessions are sometimes good
for the soul. Senator Cohen in one of his last axes?? just mentioned to
me that the annulment which initiated this was handwritten and whoever
placed it in the statute could not understand, read, or read Senator
Cohen’s writings. So we’re just making the right section. And he just
confessed that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, a further question or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just have one more question, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So, and I maybe shouldn’t,
I’m embarrassed if I don’t know this but currently the President pro tem
of the senate and the Speaker of the House can intervene on behalf of
the legislature in these actions? That’s the current law? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate, Senator Tucker, for which purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to ask Senator Hartsell a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, do you yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Hartsell, I don’t know if you know all these answers in this lengthy
bill, but I presume you do, since you can find interesting reading in
the 1943 statues a normal person would not, but as Senator Apodaca says,
these food service requirements that are in this bill for the aquarium
and the museum, etc. they are still required to have the food
inspections by the appropriate county that they reside in, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would assume they are, yes, there is no exemption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, the other question— [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Tucker, a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, Mr. President, I have
two questions, I have more question again, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield for another question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator

The firearms that are repossessed by the Sheriff’s Department, are they
able to be resold if they’re in good shape, satisfied to working order
or will they be destroyed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I recall, the section your speaking of, they’re were 5 or 6 counties
where they had to be destroyed. And this puts those counties in
compliance where they can be sold.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. One more question Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, in this type of corrections bill, are we requiring
every pruning company, tree landscape company or what ever that prunes
shrubs or vegetation in front of a billboard to require to have a
vegetation permit from the Division of Highways?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This time you stumped me Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will have to get back with you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very well sir, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, you indicated something about a normal person. I think under the
root ?? definition sense Senator Hartsell has a law degree; he does not
fit the definition of a normal person.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President for that clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Senator Ford, what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if the bill sponsor will entertain a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields. .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, on section 57, Department of Commerce Contracting
Functions. Are you aware that the contracting entered into pursuant to
this section is exempt from article 3, ?? Chapter 143 of the general
statute has been removed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I’m aware, yes. If I weren’t, I now know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.	.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I understand you correctly say that, that section has been removed
from this technical corrections bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There was one section relating to these contracts that was removed in
rules today. They’re working on additional language to try to address
it. I do not know whether this is what was addressed and we will look at
that on ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last follow up Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, would you work with me if that’s not the case?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Hearing none. Question for the Senate is
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of Senate Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Hartsell. I just want clarification on this and
Senator Ford kind of started a question but I just want clarity. What in
article 3 and 3C of chapter 143, you can tell I’m not a lawyer, is that
the provision that referrers to minority women in business enterprise
MWB contracts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which, if I might?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bottom of page 53, sentence…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What section of the bill is what I…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 57.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again Mr. President and Senator Robinson, it may, but again, there was
an amendment this morning. I’m not sure, it appears to be in the bill
but it was supposed to be removed from the bill in rules this morning.
And we’re working on the prospect for an additional amendment to be
considered tomorrow to address the language as to how it impacts what,
where and who. But I’m not even sure if section 57 is supposed to be in
the bill at this point in time. I’m not saying it is or isn’t. I just
remember the discussion with the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Really, just a statement that I ask, as you look at that if that is
that, well your objection at third reading…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re objecting third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Hearing none. Question for the Senate is a
passage of the senate committee substituted to house bill 1133 on its
second reading. All in favor will vote aye. All opposed will vote no.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
State your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. We’re having such a productive session here,
I’d like to move the bill formally read in, House Bill 272, DoT Changes,
be placed before us for immediate consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered.  House Bill 272. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 272. DoT/DMV Changes 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, I have you as the spokesperson on this bill. Senator Ford
is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, House Bill
272, this bill includes several recommendations from the joint
legislative transportation oversight committee and other various
transportation provisions that require the General Assembly’s attention
before we adjourn. This is a fairly technical bill and I know of no
opposition and I would appreciate your support. Section 1, Ladies and
gentlemen of the Senate, it is a consumer service initiative that allows
the hearing of the interlock violation to be heard in the county where
the person resides as opposed to the county where violation occurs.
Section 2, single license plate renewal sticker. DMV has requested this
change to allow  for only one sticker on the license plate rather than
two. This modernization effort should simplify the process for customers
while saving DMV about $70,000 annually. Section 3, permanent
registration for plate clarification motor vehicle owned by federally
recognized tribe. This is a technical correction that ensures that
federally recognized tribes are treated like other local governments.
It’s consistent with DMV policy and an opinion of the Attorney General.
Section 4, clarify application for dealer fee disclosure requirements.
This provision clarifies that the dealer online registration fees are
not covered by the highway use tax. It is consistent with existing
practices so that there’s no financial impact. Section 5, motor vehicle
license probation authorized service of hearing order, motor vehicle
dealer licensee. This allows DMV increased flexibility in working with
automobile dealers by allowing the division to place a dealer on
probation rather than simply denying or suspending or revoking a
dealer’s license. Section 6, change to motor vehicle dealer license
service of hearing order. Allows DMV to serve hearing orders in dealer a
salesman hearing in a variety of ways as set out in rule 4 in North
Carolina rules of civil procedure. License and theft is currently
sending out certified mailer and sending employee out to the customer to
hand over...hand deliver orders that call for a license suspension or
revocation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, excuse me, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Senator Ford yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Senator Ford yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, before you started on this bill, was anybody against it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As Senator Lucas used to tell me, you might want to stop while you’re
ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I’d like to stop while I’m ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage Senate Committee Substitute to House
Bill 272 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote
no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record
the vote.
Senator Newton, aye.
46 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, House Bill
272 has passed its second reading and will without objection...</p>
