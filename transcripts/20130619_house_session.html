Whirligig Park in Wilson.   I am humbled to speak of the legacy Vollis
Simpson, and encourage all of you to come to Wilson.  A long, long life

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Tolson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House.  I had the
pleasure of visiting Mr. Simpson's workshop, and you talk about an
inspiring situation that it truly was for me.  To walk in and see stuff
piled everywhere, it sort of reminded me of the shop we had at my home
farm.  But he was a creative genius.  He took that scrap metal from
anywhere he could find, or anybody would give to him and created some
magnificent whirligigs.  It was truly inspiring just to see a man that
didn't considered, and I think Representative Martin explained to me
right, he didn't think of him as an artist, but he was a true genius in
what he did with those scrap metals and putting them together.  I hope
that you, and Representative Martin referred to this, I hope you will go
on-line and look at the pictures that she sent.  It would just inspire
you to look at the work this man did, and it was just a hobby for him as
he started out. I doubt he ever thought it would be as world-wide known
as it is, but he was truly a great artist, a true asset to the Wilson
County area, and I hope that this whirligig park is completed, as you're
traveling in our area of the state, that you will take time to go by and
visit and see the mastery of the work that he did, and the legacy he's
going to leave for North Carolina for years and years to come for people
to enjoy.  It's just really inspiring to see his work and I commend the
resolution to you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This was an amendment I put forward yesterday to
protect property rights of innocent landholders. An unintended
consequence is it completely fouls up laws related to lawsuits by third
parties. It would not be a trivial exercise to correct the problems this
amendment would create. And rather than try to do committee work on the
floor, it is my intent to withdraw this amendment and try to address
that issue in a separate bill at a later date. I ask for your support on
reconsideration. [speaker changes]

About just before session. As I look at it more though it seems that the
FERC, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for those of us who don't
work with it everyday, it did allow each of the 50 states to opt out if
it wished, but it seems to me as I'm reading it that the commission
thought it would be more competitive if states did not opt out. Or they
said if states want to opt out they could but on the other hand for
reasons of competition they could choose not to opt out. So we have
chosen to opt out, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. We've chosen to opt out because of
reasons, the technical reasons I explained. I don't think you want to go
home and see a ground fault on the circuit that wasn't owned by the
company utility go bad and the whole city of Durham or the whole city of
Raleigh be in black.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you first Representative Hager, I appreciate
that. I thought about this and appreciate the topic about the technical
nature of it, i just have to look a it this way. That if FERC at the
federal level decided it was something that was useful to allow
companies who are not located in one state to none the less own
transmission lines. If they thought that was a reasonable idea and made
such an order, that seems like a good idea form the perspective of
competition. Now Representative Hager has talked about technical issues
but what I see overriding it is that we are restricting competition, we
are preventing other companies from coming into this state and competing
with our existing utilities on the question of owning transmission
lines, which in turn could save consumers some money. So while I
appreciate Representative Hagers explanation it seems to me this really
is in final analysis an anti-competitive bill and I at least am gonna
vote no. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. This bill comes to us from
Sanchez [SP], Hunt, Rabin and Harrington, it passed with one descending
vote in the senate and was in transportation I believe yesterday. And it
just gives the Department of Transportation the ability based on
engineering and traffic investigation that they determined 75 miles per
hour is a safe and reasonable limit, that they have the ability to set
that rate. And I believe in the bill it may contain information about -
this is not in, it may be in municipalities but is normally in rural
areas, controlled access highways.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Wish to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm gonna oppose this bill although generally I agree
with almost everything that Representative Iler says and does and
usually vote right along with him. but the reason I'm gonna oppose it is
because the tolling bill, house bills 267 that we sent over to the
senate, they're sitting on them, apparently are not going to pass it. So
if you're concerned about your interstate possibly being tolled as I am,
and as your remember that was a bill that dealt with interstates across
the entire state, it wasn't just picking one out. One of the few
bargaining chops that we'll have with them is that they can create new
lanes, make those hot lanes where people can drive through the state
faster and pay for it and thus pay for those new lanes without having to
toll the lanes we already have. The faster we let the speed limits go on
the roads we have we've got no bargaining chips left, and what the DOT
is eventually gonna try to do is come back and toll our interstate
starting with I-95. So for that reason I'm gonna oppose this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I don't see anything in here about tolling and I
think it's a stretch to the comments we just heard.</p>

Everyone’s entitled to their opinions, and again, the bill says they may
set these based on their engineering and traffic investigation, and I
see very few areas where this is going to apply, and if you drive the
interstates today, you’ll know that 75 is pretty much the average speed,
and I take I-40 from here to the Wilmington area, and I can guarantee
you 75 is pretty average already on those interstates, and I believe
they’re going to be doing 75 miles an hour in Wake County probably or
anywhere like that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know this is one that
reasonable people can disagree on. I’m going to be voting no on the
bill, in many respects because of the comments that I read that were
pretty eloquent actually from Representative Dollar that were in the
paper and Representative Carney, but I add a couple of points. Life is
fast enough, and I don’t know; I’m sure it will add a little bit of time
to get somewhere if we move up the 5 miles per hour where DOT wants us
to do that or allows us to, but at what cost? It would seem to me, and I
suspect, that insurance companies are for the most part opposed to this.
We’ve argued a lot on this floor about trying to reduce and keep North
Carolina’s rates low. I think that there’s no question but that there
will be additional safety issues raised by this, and it will be
incumbent I think on insurance companies then to look at that data and
potentially increase rates. Whether that occurs or not I don’t know, but
it strikes me as a reasonably possibility. I’ve looked at a map that was
provided by a colleague of where the states are that have raised the
rate, the speed limit, and they are all places where there’s lots of
cattle and lots of plants and not lots of people, and that is not this
state, and finally I look at our demographic, and I look at our
demographic in our sister states where the travel is going to be up I-95
and on I-40, and our sister states are not the ones that are increasing
it, so you’re going to have… we’re going to be an exception within an
area, which I think creates its own problem, but we have a lot of young
drivers in this state, and I guess maybe going back to my school board
days, the call I always hated, as any of us would as a parent, were the
accidents and the deaths at schools, and almost inevitably they were
near the summertime and they were as a result of speed. We have an
enormous number of young people in this state and we have an enormous
number of more senior people, of which I consider myself, whose reflexes
are not what they once were, and so for the little bit of additional
gain this might get, because I view the safety costs as far exceeding
the benefit, at least for right now my vote will be no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. With all due respect to the
sponsors of the bill, I’m going to have to vote no on it as well, and
I’m going to just share with you a few reasons for my vote and you’re
going to have to vote your conscience and decide what you believe is
right. I sent an email to all of the members about an hour ago just
showing you the map of the United States that showed the 16 states that
have miles per hour posted speed limits above 70 miles per hour, and I
would just note that virtually all of those states are large western
states. They’re states that have long, flat highways and they’re states
that have much less density in their population than our state does. All
of the states in our region of the country, it’s 70 miles per hour or
less. I would also note that quite frankly, I’m glad that we have a few
miles per hour of grace if you will. For whatever reason, I’m glad that
we cannot get a ticket for just going one or two miles over. I drive
here on the interstates as I know that you do a lot, and quite honestly
I’m not very impressed with some of the driving that I see on the
highways, and I hear two schools of thought here. I’ve had some of my
colleagues say “Well it’s really not going to make any difference
because the average speed already is 75 miles per hour and people
already drive a few miles over.” Well in my estimation if the posted
speed limit goes up 5 miles</p>

Then the driver is gonna go five miles per hour and if it’s not, why are

gonna change the behavior or it’s not. And I don’t like the
ramifications either way. Because I don’t like the idea that if you run
the posted speed limit up five miles per hour and they’re still giving
tickets to the same rate, you just took away my grace. What if the tires
on my car aren’t quite the right size? Or what if I have improper
equipment? Or what if I’m being just a little bit lax and I’m two or
three or four miles per hour over, I don’t wanna get a ticket for that.
But I also don’t think that we have roads in North Carolina that people
need to be driving 83 to 85 miles per hour on because of what has
already been mentioned. Final thing I would just add is that I think
that the people on our highway, not all of the people but many people
are more distracted today than they’ve ever been before. We all seek
people on cell phones, many of us are probably guilty of doing that at
times. But I just think for all these and many reasons, safety reasons;
I just don’t see the redeeming features of this bill. And maybe people
can tell me why they think it’s such a good idea but I can’t vote for
it. So, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I speak in support of the bill and you know, most of
us are big fans of personal responsibility in today’s technological
world. Our equipment, vehicles, road improvement, etc. are generally
much better than they were quite a few years ago. And I think the key
thing here, as it says in the bill itself that DoT determines on the
basis of ?? and traffic investigation if it’s appropriate, if it’s
prudent. And with that, I ask you to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanna speak in favor of the
bill also because when I first started driving a long time ago, the
speed limit was 70 then and we’ve gone all the way down to 55 and now
we’re coming back up to where we’re giving the DoT, the option to set
the speed limit and I thought we weren’t gonna get politics out of
transportation. If that’s so, then we need to let DoT set speed limit.
If they deem that the road is safe for a 75 miles an hour speed limit
and the DMV says people are qualified and capable of driving at that
speed with the cars that are on the road now, mostly it would save time
and money. I drive three hours each way every week to get here. I would
like to see this bill passed. Thank you.

twice as big as yours, I have still not been able to fill those shoes.
I'm still trying. And you were always so supportive of me and gave me
such good advice both personally and professionally. I always called you
the Energizer Bunny. Those of you who knew her know why.  It was always
imposable to slow you down, or to catch up with you. You traveled every
mile of your district. Not only during election time but during the
entire twenty years you served your people. From Onslow to Jones to [??]
to Craven and to [??], it didn't matter how late, or how long the
journey was as long as your people needed you, you were there. Senator
Preston, as you know I've always called you that, even as well as we
knew each other, and I think you know why. It's because of the deep
respect I have for you, and will always have, and the grace that you
have shown at the legislature, and in your district Senator Preston.
Senator Preston did you know, or have any idea how much you were
respected and loved by your peers in the general assembly?  Legislators
on both sides of the aisle praised you for you dedication to education.
Especially special needs children. You were our go to legislator for
education in both the House and the Senate. You were everyone's friend.
I remember how proud you were of the legislation to help our fishermen
the Marine Fisheries Act. You told me how hard you fought for the rights
of the fishermen. How you reminisced how tough you had to be to go up
against some of the big boys in the legislature. Even though you were a
gracious southern lady, you were a fierce debate opponent. You always
fought for the underdog for what was right. I remember a story you told
me about the most important campaign contribution you ever received, and
how it was from a little lady who had quarters a nickle and a dime
wrapped up in a handkerchief. Less than a dollar. And that that small
donation meant more to you than any other large donation that you had
ever received. That showed your compassion and love for the people no
matter what their station in life. I don't know if you had a hint of the
fact at how the women in Pamlico, Craven and Carteret counties had
planned to get you the Long Leaf Pine Award. And we were told that you
had to be a civilian in order to get that award. And we had planned to
honor you as soon as the New Year arrived and your term was over. And we
did get that award for her. She had to receive it posthumously. It was
so deserved, as were so many of all your awards you received throughout
the many years. When they would read your bio with all the events even
as they would mention half of the achievements and awards I would just
sit there and keep reading and reading and reading. And I would say how
can one person be doing all those many things. And I remember you were
the Energizer Bunny and I was so proud of you. Proud to call you my
friend and mentor. Many have asked me if we ever had any disagreements
on legislation. And I said no, not really on legislation. The only one
disagreement that we've had we faced it with humor. It was about, you
called me about my deer eating your flowers. I always fed deer and she
would call me about my deer had just eaten the mums that she had just
planted. She hadn't even gotten to enjoy them for twenty four hours but
they were my deer that I had been feeding definitely came over. We lived
about six blocks from each other. And they were definitely my deer, not
anybody else deer but my deer. And I was so afraid that you would
actually ask me for a DNA sample when I told you that those were not my
deer. That if you would feed the deer corn just like I did you wouldn't
have problems with them eating your flowers. So anyway, we would always
tease about the flowers and the deer. The hours we drove back and fourth
together late at night, and the functions, and the talks, gave me
insights into what your civilian life was before you became a
legislative, into legislative public service. That's what we both like
to call politics because neither of us liked to call ourselves
politicians. Thank you for those many years you spent  as an educator.
And thank you for touching the lives of so many</p>

special needs children along the way. After over twenty years in
Education you could have retired and spent the next twenty years walking
the beaches, travelling and so many other retirement type joys. But you
chose to dedicate the next twenty years to continuation of public
service. Thank you for that. I was lying awake one night after you
passed away and I was thinking how hard you worked and hadn't gotten to
enjoy retirement, and one of your friends said to me &quot;she died with
her high heels on, she was doing exactly what she loved to do.&quot; And
you did, you worked until you took your last breath. then I started
reminding myself that there's no better place to spend retirement than
in Heaven. We both thought Emerald Isle was as close to Heaven as you
can get, but I'm sure you have found out that there is no comparison.
Enjoy the golden sand, the still waters, the green meadows and all the
wonders of Heaven, because all of us are going to be there someday.
We've lost and angel here in North Carolina, but God has gained a very
special angel. Senator Preston, we love you. I commend the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Daltry please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Jean Preston was a very good friend of mine. She
was a loyal person that you could count on through good times and bad
times and we shared some of both. She was a politician that never
thought she was going to win. She would call me up during the political
season and say that she had taken a poll and she was losing by twenty
points and that she had no money and that this was her last term and she
was going to miss everybody. And we'd feel bad about that and then when
the election was over she'd win by twenty points. She was the most
pessimistic politician I've ever met. And she did not like Pat's Deer,
she told me that several times. I would say to you that you serve down
here as long as I have you meet a lot of people that serve both in the
Senate and the House and you'll get to know them. But there will be only
a few, just one or two, that you can say I served with a real individual
who was the kind of person that's special in every way. She loved her
daughter Susan that was her LA. And we had great times having dinner, we
had great times together just talking and being friends. I miss her from
the bottom of my heart, and I certainly commend a resolution too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer-butterfield please state your

The lady is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. I first met Jean Preston in 1975. We met in a little
town called Snow Hill North Carolina. We served on an inter-agency
council together. And there all the agencies were represented and we had
an opportunity to make decisions about peoples lives who were children
and adults with developmental disabilities. And she was very
knowledgeable of the resources in the area and always came up with
creative ideas about what to do in peoples lives with handicaps or
disabilities. Later we met when we both served on an inter-agency
screening committee for Caswell center in Kinston. We continued that
relationship periodically until she came here and we lost touch with
each other. And finally in 2003 we united here in this body as members
of the legislature. And we vowed that regardless of party differences
and philosophical differences that we would not let that interfere with
out admiration and respect for each other. And we held onto that during
our lifetime of experiences together. So I commend the resolution to you
and say that she was my energized body and she was always there for me
whenever I needed some advice. So I commend the resolution to you.

government.  Some of you guys too.  Senator Preston, she was my Senator
so I didn't work with her up here.  I didn't know her as a fellow
legislator. I knew her as my Senator and she was one of the, I don't
know, she might have been the only elected official associated with
Craven County that I didn't have to go after at some point for some
thing.  I ran for the seat in 2006.  I won the primary and lost the
general election.  Well after the primary her and I kind of hung out a
little bit together while we were campaigning and one of the ladies in
the District called and she had a problem. I really didn't know what to
do on it.  I contacted Senator Preston. She did some research.  We were
surprised to find that there was nothing in the law addressing it.  I'm
not going to mention what the problem was with this lady but the thing
is it was something that really did need to be addressed and both of us
were kind of surprised that it had never been addressed.  Anyway, I
promised the lady, I said if I get elected I will submit legislation
trying to address this and Senator Preston said the same thing. Well I
lost the election, I went on with my life, aggravating elected
officials, and a few months later after Senator Preston won and she was
up here as a Senator, I picked up the paper and it said Senator Preston
introduces bill and it was the very bill addressing the very subject.
And so I called the lady that had called in the first place.  I said
have you contacted Senator Preston at all? She said no, not since I
talked to you last. And so that was what endeared Senator Preston to me.
She said she would do it and she did it. She didn't have to be contacted
over and over by the constituent.  For me, to know someone in elected
office that actually would do what they said they were going to do was a
surprise and I always considered her my favorite politician.  That's
what I used to call her.  There she is, my favorite politician.  So I
just support this resolution and commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  After my first year of law
school I had the opportunity to serve as an intern for
then-Representative Preston and work with Suzanne as well and got to
know them in a very professional way working in her office and she
taught me some very valuable lessons along the way and that summer where
her office was on one side of Representative Preston was Edgar Starnes
office and I got to know Edgar and then on the other side of
Representative Preston's office was Tim Moore and so I got to know
Nancy, his LA.  And so during that summer I kind of got the political
bug.  I was living in Morrisville, we had a neighborhood issue, and so I
was thinking about running for the Town Council where I live and she
started saying well alright.  This is how you do it. And she said ask
your dentist for money and you need to go to get your church list and
get everybody ready to knock on doors for you and send out letters and
if you need me to send a letter, I'll send out a letter.  So there's a
neighborhood in my district called Preston Neighborhood, so I sent a
letter to the women in Preston from Jean Preston and so long story short
she said don't forget to send me a request for a donation and I'll give
you money.  And so she really coached me along and introduced me to
Edgar and Edgar knew some folks in Morrisville and he started making
phone calls and next thing you know I get elected to the Morrisville
Town Council and the next thing you know I'm in the House and seeing her
in the General Assembly knowing that I'm a progeny of her political
pedigree that's kind of one of those special type experiences that I
hope everybody has a story like that. I hope everyone gets to meet
someone like Jean Preston and I think the last thing I'll say about
Representative Preston is I'm not sure who she loved more, her daughter
or her grandchildren.  And that impressed upon me more than anything.
She stayed with them when she was in Raleigh. She waa very active mother
and grandmother.  And you don't have to</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Speaker, Members of the House.
Some of you probably didn't know, but Representative Daughtry was once
my representative.
And he introduced me to Jean Preston about 13 years ago when I came here
and told me how passionate she was about education issues.
And I found that to be true, and I had the pleasure to work with her on
education committees all of these years.
And I really hated to see her leave the house and go to the senate, but
while she was there, I was still able to talk to her about different
issues.
All of the positive things that I've heard said today, I can say that
they're true, I have found them to be true in my dealings with her.
And I miss her very much and I can commend a resolution to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Speaker and Representatives of the house like
Representative Daughtry and some others, I had the pleasure of serving
with Jean Preston when she was in the house, and one of the nicest
things and one of the most sincere things I can say about her is: She
was a true lady.
There are very few people in your life that you can meet, in this day
and time and you look at them and you say &quot;They are a real
gentleman, or they are a true lady&quot;
And Jean was a true lady
There were two issues I could always go to Jean and talk about.
First of all was education and I went to her many times to ask her
advice on what to do about educational issues.
She was always standing up for her folks on the coast.
One time I remember her, we were debating a coastal issue and (It seems
like we haven't done that much this session, but in past sessions we
spent hours talking about fishing issues and that type of thing). And I
remember her looking at me one time and saying: &quot;Dockham: we've
just got to protect those people who just want to go out and catch a
mess of fish. &quot;
And that was her interest.  she looked after her constituents, the
people who menat the most to her.
She loved her family.
She loved this general assembly.
And we miss her very much.
And I certainly commend the resolution too.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and Gentleman of the House, there was never a finer person that
ever walked the halls of the General Assembly than Jean Preston.
She was a true lady, in every sense of the word.
Not only did she have impeccable conservative credentials, but she had
impeccable dress.
You always saw her she looked nice
She spoke nice.
She talked like a lady, she acted like a lady and she was a lady.
And yet she had firm beliefs.
And she never wavered in what she believed.
And she never hesitated to stand for the things that she believed in.
She rose to be the chairlady of the appropriations committee on
education, I think on the House and the Senate as well.
Yet when she would put together a budget, she wasn't looking at numbers,
or a program or a department or an agency.
But when she looked at the education, she could see the faces of people.
She was concerned about the teachers or the assistants or the cafeteria
worker or whoever it was that was going to be affected by the budget
that she was crafting.
She never lost sight that what we do in Raleigh effects people at home
in the real world.
And that was her goal.
To make sure that whatever she did, it was done in a way that would
help.
I think that was the genius of her success as an elected official
She never lost touch with the people.
She enjoyed getting out and meeting people and seeing people and they
responded to her as well.
And they elected her overwhelmingly every time she ever won.
I know that she had it made here in the House.
She had a safe district.
She had a safe seat and she could have lived out her career in the house
for as long as she wanted to be elected.
But then they came to her one time and said &quot;We want you to
consider running for the Senate&quot;
And that was a monumental task because that was not a Republican seat,
that was a Democrat seat.</p>

And it was a huge hurdle.  We'd never had a Republican Senator in that
area.  And so she said, I'm thinking about it.  And word got our, and
Mark Besnok heard that she was considering it, so he called her in and
he said, Representative Preston, you are a good legislator, and you
belong in the House, but I want you to know if you run for that Senate
seat, I'm going to spent $1 million to beat you.  And he did, but he
didn't win that election, Jean Preston won that election, and it scared
her to death, and she really had a hard decision to make.  And I said,
Jean, you have to do what's right, but if you don't run, you'll always
wonder, could I have done it.  So she accepted the challenge, and she
rose to the occasion, and she was elected not because she was a
Republican, but she was elected because the people knew her, they
respected her, they loved her, and they wanted to be represented by her.
 She was a wonderful lady, a great friend.  I can't tell you the times
that we had an opportunity to go out and eat, and she had a beautiful
sense of humor.  I mean, you could sit down at the dinner table and eat
with her, and you would just laugh, and forget every worry in the world
and just have good times with her.  She was a wonderful person, she was
an example that each of us could follow, and I commend the resolution to
you.

matter, a bill that was added to the calendar today for a concurrence

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 543, a bill
to entitle and act to address a permissible guardianship roles for

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speak, for a motion.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, I'm going to ask you to, I going to move to not concur on the
resolution, or excuse me, on the bill.  The reason is, and you may
remember, this is a bill that was unanimous in the House, not
controversial.  It allows uncompensated guardians to serve as providers
of health services to those wards that have mental health disablement
issues.  The Senate actually added a piece to it, and part of it makes
it better, but there was a technical change.  Quite honestly, the staff
saw that needs to be made, a very minor change, but Representative</p>
