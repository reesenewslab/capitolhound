Our page today is Kate Lee Johnson from Harnett County, welcome and our
Sponsors David Louis, our Sergeant-At-Arms today Young Bay, Bill Mars,
Jim Marant, thank you. We have received a request to hear House Bill 143
first so without objection we will hear from Representative Bishop
first, Representative Bishop welcome to the committee, where is he?
There he’s…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members, this bill comes forward at the
request of City of Charlotte to increase the size of Civil Service Board
from seven members to nine and the rest of city with discretion, rest of
city with discretion to increase the size to 11 the purpose being for
the hearing panels that conduct hearings into employment matters in the
fire and police services they are finding they are not able to have
members meet frequently enough to give the hearings on the time limits
that is required by the Charter and so you have like 163 days in access
of the described period. So City Councils seeks permission by modifying
the Charter to increase the size of the board and make more hearing
personnel available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Bishop. Do I have a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report to House Bill 143.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You heard for that motion, all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed, thank you. House Bill 99, thank you Sir, Town of
Polkton/Deannexation, Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I will
bring before you a Deannexation petition for Lutana Polkton it’s a small
community in?? County, if you read your packet it is supported by not
only unanimous resolution by the Polkton Council but also the people
seek Deannexation, it’s a ?? Deannexation property that had a potential
use for the town of Polkton in years back and it never materialized. So
I respectfully ask that you grant them their Deannexation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Favorable report on House Bill 99 with the referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have heard the motion, all in favor say aye, any oppose, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 131: Town of Maggie Valley/Deannexation, Representative
Presnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Yes, I have a Deannexation requested by the home
owners and we have two people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have two people that are going to speak today and they had two
minutes of piece, the first one is the Mayor of Maggie Valley if you
announce your name and you have two minutes to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Ron Desmond, this Deannexation request is based on a petition
of the people in the community two-thirds of which were purchased their
homes in 2011-2014, the premise of the petition is that the road that
they have is too narrow and there is no turn around and that we can
provide service. The reality is that we have provided service for seven
years and that road is typical of roads throughout our community as well
as Western North Carolina. The premises that the road is, because it’s
narrow is unsafe and that backing up trucks up that road is not a safe
thing to do. Well, again this is typical of the way these services are
provided throughout the North Carolina. Our services are delivered to
this community in the same manner that they are throughout our community
and throughout Western North Carolina. They have sewer trash and brush
pickup, white goods removal, police and zoning protection, we do have
our public records that show that those services have been delivered
consistently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Mayor. Mr. Eric Helfrich.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman I’m Eric Helfrich President of…

  are Evergreen Height&#39;s road maintenance group, which is not a
homeowner&#39;s association. In 2008, the town of Maggie Valley
aggressively annexed the 11 houses and additional lots in Evergreen
Heights. They did not annex the road. Though taxed fully, most residents
do not receive garbage and trash pickup. About half the road does not
receive snow removal. We have that part plowed by a nearby woodsman, as
we did before annexation. Our water and sewer&#39;s from Maggie Valley
Sanitation District, and when we were county residents we paid a rate
about 50% higher than town rate. All other services we got from Haywood
County. To receive full services, we are required to upgrade the eight
foot wide road and pay to build the turnaround. In an August 26, 2010,
letter to us, the town noted that they had thought there was an
undersized cul-de-sac, but it was a private driveway and the owner had
decided to end town access. The town has generally been unresponsive to
our needs, despite talking to us when we have asked. On February 23,
2012, the town voted three to two to de-annex the property in the upper
part of our community, as services could not be provided. According to
several aldermen who signed letters to that effect, this was never
implemented as the mayor negated it with our then-legislators. Letters
are in that are in the March 16, 2015, packet I&#39;ve been handing out,
pages 3A3 through 3A8. Two former aldermen, a current alderman, and our
representative know that there&#39;s no place to turn a truck at the end
of the road. The town knew that in 2008 before annexation. Respectfully,
the town is not always right. Representatives, committee members, in
summary, Evergreen Heights, the small community of 11 houses and vacant
lots, request de-annexation from the town of Maggie Valley. Thank you
for the time you have spent considering House bill 131, and thanks to
all the legislative assistants who guided me during this process. You
definitely know how to hire quality. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Helfers. Anything else from
Representative Presnell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll just take questions, if there&#39;s
something.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Representative Floyd. Representative
Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to ask Mr. Helfers a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Helfers, we have a question for you from
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did I understand you to say that the city annexed the
property but left the road out so they would not have to take care of
it? Is that what I heard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct, sir. I believe at the time the laws
allowed them to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any more discu-? Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to ask the gentleman another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You said they do not provide garbage service? I
believe that&#39;s what you said. It&#39;s my understanding that the
option of garbage service is available through their subcontractor, and
that at least five homes on the street utilize that service. The other
homes on the street could utilize that service, but have opted not to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have to sign a hold harmless agreement to allow the
trucks to turn in our driveway, and many of the residents have opted not
to do that. In truth, three houses at the lower end of the road have
opted for some time to have garbage pickup, and they can turn a truck,
because there is a small side road that they can back up safely. Backing
up more than several hundred yards is just not safe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is it not true that, you reference truck as if this is
a standard garbage truck, as if we think about it. But is it not true
that they use a specialized truck for this street that is somewhere
between the size of a Ford F150 and a Ford F250?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would say that it&#39;s a community-size garbage
truck with one rear axle instead of two rear axles, and it is still
quite large, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any more questions from the committee? Representative
Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for a favorable report for House bill 131 with
referral to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You&#39;ve heard the motion. All in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any opposed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Ayes have it. House bill 201. We have a motion
from Representative Boles to bring the PCS of House bill 201 before the
committee for the purposes of discussion. All those in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any opposed? Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I&#39;d like to present this
bill on behalf of myself, Representative John Fraley, Representative Ken
Goodman, and also Darren Jackson who is in court in Pender County this
morning, but wanted me to assure you

  That he hopes the bill passes. The House passed a very similar
provision, a similar bill in another bigger bill I think twice last
session and this version of it addresses at least one concern that was
raised by the opponents and I’ll get to that when I explain the bill.
The current law extremely protects the rights of some adjoining owners
in a rezoning case, an extremely destroys or devalues the rights of
other neighbors and the property owner who actually owns it and is
paying taxes on it. How that happens is this, if as few as one person
with enough frontage files a protest petition than it elevates the vote
from a majority to a 3/4 vote required which on some small boards
sometimes means it has to be unanimous depending on who’s there or all
but one person in some cases. In contrast, North Carolina law requires a
3/5 vote of the House and Senate in order to propose Constitutional
amendments. Federal law requires 2/3 vote of each house of Congress to
do so or 2/3 to override a Presidential veto. We can amend our
constitutions or override vetoes with a smaller vote count than what one
individual can trigger for a rezoning. A little context, for the past 26
years zoning laws changed so that conditional use zoning is available
where rezoning requests can be basically tailored to the needs of the
town and many towns require applicants to meet with all the neighbors
within a large area, say 300 feet I believe in Apex, to make sure their
concerns are addressed and with modern technology neighbors, anybody in
town can access all the information with the touch of a button if they
know how to do it. I’m not that good at it. Notice things have changed a
lot since this zoning protest petition was put in place I belive in the
1920s. If it was envisioned as a means of leveling the playing field and
ensuring notification of and input from adjacent owners, that rationale
has long since expired. A typical rezoning takes months and months and
even years to complete with all the steps that have to be gone through.
In a recent North Carolina Supreme Court case, Highrock Lake Partners,
LLC, about a year and a half ago, they talked about the due process
rights to protect property owners from state delegations of power that
give neighbors the authority to regulate how another person uses his or
her property. The current zoning protest petition has the same defect.
One quick, true, short story before I go to the bill, and that’ll be
short as well. You want a short story, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, I was 7 or 8 years old, lived in
Greensboro, was the Greensboro Delegation near Friendly Shopping Center.
Every afternoon I’d go play at our treehouse a couple blocks from our
house. Wonderful treehouse. We would also go under the culvert under
Friendly Shopping Center. That was pretty dangerous. One day I went to
play in my tree and the treehouse had been torn down and I went home,
they were gonna build a house there apparently, and I went home and told
my mother and cried and complained and you know what she told me, one
day when you’re big you can buy a tree of your own and have your own
land, but that land doesn’t belong to you, Skipper, she said. Okay. And
this is the basic problem. The real property rights is in the owner of
the property, not the people who wanna control somebody else’s property,
so what does the bill do? It does away with this idea that you can
elevate the vote beyond a majority vote just because it’s a rezoning,
but some concerns were raised that, well, how can, people still need to
protest what the council, the city’s gonna do. So the very first part of
the bill says that if people wanna protest that they can still protest
it. File it with the City Clerk and the city, if they do it at least two
days before the council cause they’ve gotta get their agenda out, then
the City Clerk will bring these protests to the attention of the
council. There’s an exception for that for quasi-judicial

  hearings because we can&#39;t let unsworn testimony infect the ears of
the council people. But if somebody wants to testify under oath, they
can still do that in opposition. The second thing it does, since
we&#39;re going down to a true majority, on page two, section five, we
make sure it is a true majority. And this relate to a sentence that
I&#39;ve always despised in 168-175. The second sentence, which says
that in case of a failure to vote by a member who is physically present
in the council chamber or who has withdrawn without being excused,
that&#39;s recorded as an affirmative vote. In other words, if you get
up to go to the bathroom, somebody can cast your vote for you in favor.
Or if in disgust you leave, or if you get an emergency call to come
rescue your child or your dog, then they can count your vote. So
theoretically it is possible for one person to outvote two other people
by casting the votes of two people who aren&#39;t there. This says that
will not apply in rezoning cases. We&#39;re talking about a true
majority of the council, not a pretend majority. If I thought I had it
in my power, I would just repeal that entire sentence, and maybe the
local government committee should be the one to look at that, Mr.
Chairman. But at least in this context, since we&#39;re reducing from
three-fourths to a majority, it needs to be a true majority. Be glad to,
section three&#39;s really just technical, and section two is a
conforming change as well. Be glad to answer questions, or if you want
staff to further talk about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee discussion or questions. Representative
Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I got a quick question. By
submitting this in writing, are you taking away the citizen&#39;s right
to petition or to talk directly to the council? That if it&#39;s a
zoning requirement, they can only do that in writing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, ma&#39;am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Am I misunderstood that? That&#39;s what I was trying
to
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. No, ma&#39;am. This just assures that if they
submit it in writing, that it will be brought to their attention, but
unless it&#39;s a quasi-judicial hearing, which is another case, you can
talk to council members all you want. I mean you ought to. It does not
in any way stop a oral protest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But they could address it. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma&#39;am. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They can address it at a city council meeting?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. Certainly. What it does is we&#39;re not going
to change the vote from majority to three-fourths just because you spoke
up. But you can still talk about it, write about it, do picket signs,
whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Motion when appropriate, but I&#39;d like
to make a couple comments, if I could. I have experienced this issue in
the past as a mayor in a city the size of Burlington where we had a
five-member council. And I know of on at least two occasions where a
property owner was in the process of trying to develop property. The
development of the property was fully within the existing zoning that
was within the city, and in both of these cases, and I&#39;m going to
just use one example. In one case a neighborhood across the highway
filed a protest petition and was able to tie this piece of property up
in the development of this property for two years. In the meantime, the
property owner lost the development opportunity because of the timeframe
involved, and it was really just one individual in the neighborhood that
was causing this issue. On a council the size that we had with five
members, all we had to have was one person absent and it was dead in the
water. You couldn&#39;t do anything. And unfortunately in Burlington,
those that filed the protest petitions knew that we had a small council
and took advantage of that. So for us, in my city, it was almost like a
nuisance, because you had property owners that in all right wanted to
develop the property and were unable to do so. They met all the
qualifications, all the zoning requirements

  but had one person in an adjoining neighborhood that blocked it. And so
for that reason, I fully support making this change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I&#39;m going to speak on the
bill, if you will, and offer an amendment, but I wondered first. I do
know we have at least one representative from the League of
Municipalities that&#39;d like to be heard on the bill, and I wondered
if you&#39;d honor that request?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was waiting until we were possibly finished with
committee discussion, but if you&#39;d like to go now, we&#39;ll do it
now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it would help the debate, sir, if you would
allow that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Anyone wanting to speak for or against
this, please come to the microphone and identify yourself. And you have
one minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and
thank you, Representative Luebke and Representative Stam, and I know our
folks have spoken about this. My name is Rose Vaughn Williams and I am
the Government Affairs Director for the North Carolina League of
Municipalities that represents 540 cities and towns around the state,
and some are on both sides of this issue. And as you know, the protest
petition is a means by which a certain percentage of property owners who
want to petition their government who oppose a potential change in the
zoning map or zoning map amendments may petition that government, in
this case through city council, to oppose this potential zoning change.
And the protection for them in the statute is that if enough people or
enough property owners sign on, a certain percentage of the property
owners, then the city council can only make that zoning change if a
supermajority of the city council votes for it, and that&#39;s the
position there. We recognize that this has come before the General
Assembly for many years, and we recognize that it probably has teeth to
pass, or the push to pass. We recognize we have members on both sides of
the issue, and therefore we support a compromise proposal, if we could.
And I just think Senate bill 285 has been filed that could contain that,
which is to maybe reduce the people that could file that petition, and
maybe change the supermajority down a little for the city council to
have a compromise, so the people still have that little bit more of a
teeth than just a simple majority would give them, that this bill does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Your time&#39;s up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Anyone else wishing to speak for or against, identify
yourself, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I&#39;m Richard Beard, member
of the North Carolina NAIOP Joint Chapters of the Governmental Affairs
Committee. NAIOP is the leading voice of commercial real estate and
development with chapters in Charlotte, the Triangle, the Triad. I also
am a commercial real estate broker and developer with Schulman and Beard
in Greensboro. On behalf of the hundreds of NAIOP members across North
Carolina, we urge you to support House bill 201 as presented by
Representative Stam, Goodman, Jackson, and Fraley. This amendment to the
current legislation is necessary due to the unfair governmental power it
bestows to a very small minority of persons neither elected to a
governmental body nor appointed by a governmental body. Such power in
the hands of unelected citizen is without precedent, it is contrary to
our system of checks and balances on governmental power, it has no
justification, and it is wrong. Please support the amendment as
presented in House bill 201 and make the process which city and councils
receive input and zoning ordinances cases fair for all citizens. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Anyone else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Colleen Kochanek. I represent the Apartment
Association of North Carolina, and we also support this bill. The
reasons, obviously, have already been stated very well by Representative
Stam. But I wanted to give an example of one of our developers who
worked with the neighbors and worked with the whole community around the
development. They made a lot of changes to their plans. They spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars on engineers and lawyers to change
them. And then a couple of the neighbors who didn&#39;t agree with all
the other neighbors filed a protest petition. So now they had to start
all over again. So we urge you to support the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Anyone else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I&#39;m Mike Carpenter,
general counsel for the North Carolina Home Builders Association. We
strongly support this legislation. We have been working on this for
about 20 years, and we appreciate Representative Stam bringing this
forward. What I would say about the proposed compromise that Ms.
Williams, Rose Vaughn Williams mentioned is that seems to make nobody
happy. As I understand, a number of the cities that I&#39;m personally
familiar with, the number of cities across the state who want to get rid
of, as Representative Ross just indicated, this antiquated process that
was adopted in the 1920s when there was very little communication
possible to citizens. We live in a different age, and as you&#39;ve
already heard from some of the examples, Representative Ross and
Colleen&#39;s example, that&#39;s not a

  Problem anymore. This is an antiquated process that needs to go. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Anyone else? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
please. My name is Michi Voyta and I’m a resident here in Raleigh. I’m a
citizen, I don’t, I’m not paid to come here. I came here on my own
volition and I want to support the valid statutory protest petition. I
am somebody in a community. I own a house, a bunch of single family
homes, lower income homes. They’re not the most tech-savvy people alive,
don’t speak English as a first language and the idea that somebody can
come and put a freeway sized bright gas station with 14 pumps
immediately next to homes without the citizens having anything to say
about that is very discouraging. We used the valid statutory protest
petition because we did not find that council was, we did not feel that
council or the planning commission would listen to us without some kind
of clout. In addition, because of our discussions with that last case
that we had the developers who are now interested in developing a
different corner have come to us in advance to speak to the community to
work this out with us civilly and in a democratic fashion. No, we don’t,
I don’t own that big property of land, but I do own land next to it that
would be damaged dramatically by insensitive development so I appreciate
the fact that the VSPP helped us in that it didn’t force the council to
vote in our favor, it forced people to pay attention to the fact that a
lot of citizens in the area, not just one, a lot of citizens in the area
were very much against having something slapped in their back yard
without, that would have such influence on them, that would be built up
above them and also that it helped, the previous case helped bring the
current case to us earlier so that we could talk about it and try to
have some discussions. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Anyone
else? Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Let
me say about this that first of all as Mr. Carpenter has said, this has
been a provision in our statute since the 1920s. Its purpose today is to
protect neighbors from outside development that happens right near where
they are, adjacent to where they are in many cases and what this says is
for example, you have a group of homes, you have a neighborhood and all
of the sudden a 14 pump gas station proposal as was laid out,
increasingly in North Carolina they’re called Sheetz. The Sheetz wants
to come in and really undermine the neighborhood from the standpoint of
livability, quality of life, property value. The neighbors are coming
together to say, under this process come together and say this is really
detrimental to us as neighbors, as citizens of this city, taxpayers of
this city and we need a process whereby we can protect ourselves from
major commercial development whether it’s a gas station, super gas
station, whether it’s an asphalt plant which might offer pollution to
the neighbors in addition to being oversized, this feature, the protest
petition, helps the neighborhood. Now some have said, many have said in
criticism, Representative Stam among them, that this is simply unfair to
have so few people be able to stop a situation from its normal majority
decision by the city council. So, what I think is appropriate and would
ask the members of the committee to consider is a compromise that
increases the number of neighbors really who have to be protesting.
That’s the first part of my amendment and I do, Mr. Chairman, let me
just say I would send forth the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, we
have an amendment before you. It should be at your seat. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It should be AST9 and it’s an act to amend Article 19 to alter
qualification requirement, so we’re offering here a change that
basically goes from 3/4 of the vote of the city council to 2/3 and as I
indicated to Representative Stam, his bathroom break example, I’d
gladly, if the committee will accept this amendment I’ll gladly have a
correcting or perfecting amendment on the floor to take care of that
issue cause I think he has, makes a valid point there. These shouldn’t
have an automatic yes there because you’re out of the room. I think
something of this importance

  It does make a, it does make a good point. But what this does is drop it
from three-fourths to two-thirds. From the, on the council. The second
thing that it does is it increases the number of protests that need to
be established from 5% to 15%. This is in section two, part two of
section one. It&#39;s on line 21. So we have an increase for the
citizens from 5% to 15%. And we have a reduction of the vote required by
the city council from two-thirds, from three-fourths to two-thirds.
Members, I think this is a legitimate compromise. And allows us to go
forward and see if it&#39;s going to allow more development to go
through without the feeling that the neighbors are being obstructionist.
I have ?? this is a, the protest position is something that has been
used effectively by members of, citizens of my constituency, citizens of
Durham. And I know it&#39;s been used by many other citizens to protect
their property values, protect the quality of life in their
neighborhood.
I understand Representative Stan&#39;s bill wants to get rid of that.
But that really is not fair to the residents. This requires the
residents to do more and allows the protest to be overruled with fewer
votes than the current law. Two-thirds rather than three-fourths and 15%
rather than 5%. So Mr. Chairman, I&#39;d be happy to take any questions
from members on about ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, did you
have something to say on the amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do Mr.
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to, first of all, compliment Representative
Lubki. I think this is a step in the right direction. I served seven
years as a city councilman, and we had about 7 to 10 protest petitions
during that time.  However, here&#39;s my concern with this amendment.
Why I would hope the committee would vote against the amendment. The
most important thing we do in city council government is set the tax
rate. It requires a simple majority vote and the citizens can&#39;t
require us to have a super majority vote on that.
You&#39;re requiring a simple, a super majority vote with only 15% if
this amendment passes, of the affected neighbors. If this was 67%, if it
was of a super majority of the neighbors that matched up with the super
majority  required vote, I may be supportive of it. But 15% is still too
low a threshold, I think, it&#39;s still allows for the bad actors on
the other side of the equation.
Home owners try to use this to get a new fence. And I&#39;ve seen that
happen in my town. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the rule, but it does
occur. 15% to me is still too low a threshold. It needs significantly
larger. If you want the city council or town board to have a super
majority vote, it&#39;s ?? a super majority of the citizens protesting
as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah I&#39;m a have to apologize in advance because this is probably a
silly question. But if we go with two-thirds, what is two-thirds of a
city council of five? But then follow up. But that&#39;s four out of
five. That&#39;s 80%. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stan. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] At least two-thirds. Whatever you like consider an override
vote or something. So in case of a five member board that would be four.
And on lines 16 to 17, he&#39;s also striking the language that says
that you&#39;re not a member of the council if its vacant. So he&#39;s
including vacant positions.
So in some cases it would actually be a higher margin. This amendment
was voted down on the house floor last session. Almost the same
amendment by Representative Myer, who offered it. And I would urge the
committee to defeat it because it&#39;s, one person can easily own 15%
in many ?? And it allows that one person to legal, and I&#39;m not
saying criminally, to legally extort from the land owner things that the
city council does not want them to be extorted from. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Question, Representative Stan

  A city is considering the annexation of a five square mile area on the
edge of that city. What is the vote required of the council to pass
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Annexation is a majority vote only. This is really
unique, the three-fourths requirement in city government. I can&#39;t
think of any other vote that set like that other than a majority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I would like to thank
Representative Jeter for raising an interesting point. That should the
neighborhood opponents of a property owner&#39;s use of his property
have the same burden of percentage as that property owner as that
property owner has to get from the city council? And I was wondering if
Representative Luebke would agree to set the super-majority percentage
to pass a protest petition to be the same as the percentage of the
property owners that would be required to initiate that percentage?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold on. Representative Luebke, go right ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Representative Brawley, if I can have your
support on the amendment I will make the adjustment that you&#39;re
talking about, because it saves at least the concept of neighborhoods
worried about what&#39;s going on adjacent to them. The bill that
Representative Stam is presenting to us gives no special standing to the
neighbors who are harmed by an inappropriate, say, commercial or
industrial development. So if you would like to put a friendly amendment
on this amendment, I would gladly accept that, as I think saving the
notion of the protest petition is very important. And I would ask you
back, would you be willing to do that, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask a question of Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you support such an amendment, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir. It has the same basic flaw. Thomas Jefferson
defined democracy, I&#39;ll get this for you out of my books, as
basically, not a republic. What a democracy is, is majority vote. And
you have to have a really, really good reason to require something other
than a majority vote, like changing the constitution, because that
affects people&#39;s fundamental rights. But only fundamental rights,
fundamental rights here are the rights of the property owner, not the
neighbors, and a majority of the council should be able to make that
decision between the adjoining owner and the property owner without it
being jacked up artificially, and in many cases. I&#39;ve seen a lot of
zoning. Sometimes it&#39;s 100 property owners, sometimes it&#39;s 1 or
2. So even 67% of the adjoining owners can sometimes be one unelected
person who is, therefore, on a five member board, has therefore changed
the vote required from three to four, but without ever being elected as
a council-member.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the Luebke amendment before you. All those in
favor of the amendment, say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any opposed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Nos have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment fails.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, that sure didn&#39;t sound like a
majority against.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ve taken the vote. The vote is concluded.
We&#39;ll move on back to the bill. Any more discussion on the bill?
Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just wanted to ask a question of the bill&#39;s
sponsor and the way that he explained the outcome of a vote. So a
council vote, so are you saying that if the meeting occurred, and a
committee of five, and if one person leaves and then casts a vote for
him or her indirectly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s current law. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But isn&#39;t it not true that if the meeting start
with five, the fifth person leave, it does not affect the outcome,
because he or she should have been there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It doesn&#39;t affect the quorum, but it could very
well affect the outcome of the vote, because if that person was against
it and would&#39;ve voted no, it would be one thing. If they would vote
yes, it&#39;s another

  Admitted they didn&#39;t know session was not at 11 so we do have until
10 till. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Now
Representative Ross would like to withdraw your motion we&#39;ll take up
this amendment. If not we will go forth with the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ask the bill sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Have you been consulted about this amendment and do you agree to it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well obviously I&#39;ve heard the previous discussion.
I know that the amendment also deletes lines 15-18 so it&#39;s making it
possibly even worse and even if it didn&#39;t do that we would oppose
the amendment because there&#39;s not a rational reason. I don&#39;t
mean that you&#39;re irrational, there&#39;s no, there&#39;s no, I
cannot think of a real reason why it should take more of a majority to
pass a zoning change than for us to propose an amendment to the
Constitution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair, in consideration of the time that&#39;s available and the fact
that there is another opportunity to present an amendment could we take
a minute just to let Representative Ross maintain his motion so we could
move this out of committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, yes, Representative
Ross. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I&#39;d like to move forward with the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a motion before us to accept the PCS
House Bill 201 as favorable. All those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER
