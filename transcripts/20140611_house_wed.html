The House will come to order. Members will take their seats, visitors
will retire from the chamber, the Sergeant-At-Arms will close the door,
members and visitors will please silence all electronic devices. The
prayer today will be offered by Representative Ruth Samuelson. Members
and guests in the gallery, we please ask that you stand during the
prayer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you all. I had actually a little callout
today for two members who are not here. As you all know, Representative
Horn is very good about making sure we know everything about Winston
Churchill, and Representative Stam is really good about memorizing all
the legal documents the proceeded the year six or seven hundred, but
when I came to the legislature, the way I was prepared was to memorize
passages of scripture, and so this year as I started the short session,
there were a couple of passages that came to mind and I wanted to share
those real quickly with you, and then actually just bless us in the same
prayer that Aaron blessed the people of Israel when they were about to
conquer the promised land. But the passages that I had, the first one
was out of Jeremiah 29, and I hope this will find you comfort. “I know
the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord. “Plans to prosper you and
not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.” And now that we
are in the middle of session and things are tired, there was a passage
out of Matthew: “Come to me all ye who are weary and burdened and I will
give you rest” – something we always like about this time. And then in
John 14, it says “Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do
not give to you as the world gives, so do not let your hearts be
troubled and do not be afraid.” So I’ll close with the prayer of Aaron
if you’ll bow with me. The Lord bless us and keep us. The Lord make his
face shine upon us and be gracious to us. The Lord turn his face to us
and give us peace. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland,
