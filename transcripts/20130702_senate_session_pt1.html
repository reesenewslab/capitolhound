The Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery,
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in
the gallery will please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's pray together.
Heavenly Father we come before you and you know what's on this calendar
today, Lord, way before we did. Lord, why does the gate that leads to
destruction and narrows the path that leads to life. Lord, what is our
path? We seek your wisdom for walking on that path. None of us know that
path. There are so many people here with so many opinions, so many great
ideas, it's hard to hear what's actually the right path sometimes. You
actually are that path, Jesus. You are that narrow little road, and you
have a love for us that shines like 10,000 suns. A love of God that is
the hymn of this road. The crippled can come and they can sing this hymn
so let the needy join this throng, let the widowed here in hope and
bring every wonder on this table that will come. You will not send us
away empty handed. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger is recognized
for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. The journal of
Monday, July 1, 2013 has been examined and is found to be correct. I
move that we dispense with the reading of the journal and that it stand
approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, the journal
for July 1st stands approved as written. Senators, we have leaves of
absence today granted for Senators Jenkins, Robinson and Senator Don
Davis. Senators, we do have a nurse of the day with us today. Our nurse
is Dr. Patricia Queen of Asheboro, North Carolina. Dr. Crane if you'll
please stand and be recognized. Thank you so much for your service to
the Senate today. On the motion of Senator Tamara Barringer of Wake
County the chair is happy to extend courtesies of the gallery to Mike
Dorman, founder of MMIA, Military Missions in Action, an organization
dedicated to helping wounded veterans with projects that include
homebuilding and remodeling for handicapped accessibility to providing
shoeboxes to soldiers. Mike was awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal
in 2012 and the AAAA Edward Kennedy Community Service Award and the 2010
Newman's Own award. At this time I'd like to recognize Senator Ron
Rabin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Mike, on behalf of myself, Senator
Barringer and Senator Barefoot, congratulations to you on the award and
welcome to the balcony and into the gallery. I'd like everyone to know I
had the privilege of attending the ceremony in ?? that honored Mike for
his work with the MMIA. After listening to the testimony of his friends,
his neighbors and his family and coworkers, it was evident that his
being awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal was more than deserved.
His efforts on behalf of wounded veterans and his community service are
in the best traditions of our American way of life. It is an honor and a
privilege to know Mike and I wish him well as he continues with his
work. Mike, just be sure that you can call on me for sure and I know the
other Senators involved, to help in any way that we can. Thank you and
God bless you and America. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Dorman, please stand
and be recognized. Senator Barefoot, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Moment of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor for a point of personal privilege out of
order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Today I would like to
recognize citizens of the town of Garner who have joined us here in
their lovely blue t-shirts. I represent the town of Garner and its been
a real privilege.</p>

Privilege. And, I’ll tell you. Because, that’s where my parents are
from. I never dreamed in a million years that I would represent the area
that my parents grew up in. It has been quite a privilege. What’s
important is that on June the 16th, a couple of weeks ago, Garner, North
Carolina was recognized as a 2013 All America City by the National Civic
League. Garner was one of ten communities across the country to win this
award. Garner is the first locality in the triangle to win the award
since Durham in 1982-1993 and the first Wade County municipality to earn
the award since Raleigh in 1974 and 1975. The award is often called the
Nobel Prize of civic accomplishment. In a video presentation, the 2011
American Idol winner Scotty McReary of Garner, described Garner’s three
best projects that have resulted in significant local impact and action
planning within the past five years. The Garner Veterans Memorial at
Lake Benson Park. The Community of Hope Charity operating out of First
Baptist church of Garner, and the Garner performing arts center among
many other things. I can tell you that I’m extremely proud to recognize
them for their great accomplishments. Garner has a brand, and that brand
is a strong community. With that, Mr. President, I would like to send
forth a Senatorial statement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can send forth your statement, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

of Garner, their staff, mayors, community members, economic development

[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 998, tax deduction act. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger is recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, we now come back to
House Bill 998, if you'll recall a few weeks ago we had this bill in a
different form on the floor, passed it on second reading and from that
point forward we have been attempting to work out differences that we
have with the House on the bill, and I'm not going to go through the
bill in its entirety. What I want to do is give you an idea of some of
the changes from the bill that you heard a couple of weeks ago and how
we've made modification that I believe moves us closer to where the
House is or where the House was when House Bill 998 passed that body.
The first thing is the personal income tax rate. We continue to go with
a flat rate but instead of the ultimately 5 1/4% number that we had in
our previous version of this bill or the 5.9% rate that the House had in
its bill, this current version has a personal income tax rate of 5 3/4%,
again, a movement towards the House position. Secondly, on charitable
contributions, we have moved to the House position on charitable
contributions so that for individual taxpayers 100% of charitable
contributions are deductible against their income.</p>

<p id="020:00">
With reference to social security, we have adopted the house position on
that. We have moved to the fact that social security would not be
subject to taxation, no change in current law. With reference to
mortgage interest and property tax deduction, the provisions in this
bill would provide for a limited deduction of mortgage interest and
property taxes up to 15,000 dollars for folks who are married filing
jointly. Lower numbers for heads of households or for single taxers.
With reference to the 50,000 dollars small business deduction, which is
a provision that was implemented by this body for small businesses. We
would continue that for the 2013 tax year which we are halfway through.
It would be eliminated beginning in 2014. That maintains the Senate
position, the house would have eliminated that in 2013. With reference
to food tax, we make no change to the local imposition of food tax. We
make no change with reference to those local revenues for cities and
counties.  In connection with the corporate income tax, we modified the
position that we had in the original bill. In that bill, we phased out
the corporate income tax over four years. This bill phases it out over
five years. With reference to the franchise tax, and the business
license fee, we continue to eliminate the franchise tax for S
corporations and we make S corporations and LLC’s subject to a new
business license fee that ultimately will be… Starts out at $400 and
then moves up to $500. With reference to the franchise tax on C
corporations, we move that tax down from $1.5 per thousand to 75 cents
per thousand. With reference to local privilege taxes, we adopt the
house position and hold local governments harmless with regard to local
privilege taxes. With reference to a house position which would impose
or expand the sales tax base to service contracts, we adopt the house
position in this bill and do likewise. On the non-profit refunds which a
lot of you heard a lot about. We modified the Senate position
substantially so ultimately we phase down the refund, but we phase it
down to point that non-profits that receive a refund of 2.85 million
dollars or less will receive 100% of their refund. Those who would
normall receive a refund in excess  of 2.85 million dollars would
ulitmately not receive any refund for sales tax they paid above that
amount. This will make a huge difference for the rural hospitals, which
I’m sure a lot of you have heard from. Make a big for most of the
private colleges and universities and I would say virtually every church
and religious institution in the state would receive their full refund
as they do presently. The bill also has an additional provisions and
that additional provision is that it does cap the gas tax for a period
of two years. That’s something that is new to this version of the bill
and not something that was in the house bill. The bill itself, based on
projections from our non-partisan staff, fiscal research staff, would
provide for revenue growth of 3% in 2014-15. 3.1% in 2015-16. 3.7% in
2016-17 and 4.3% in 2017-18. What that means is that the projected
revenue growth on a year over year basis is at least 600 million dollars
per year. That is revenue growth to address any needs for increased
population and inflation with reference to state government
expenditures. What I’d like to say is that there’s been a good deal of
work done on trying to find some common ground between what Senate was
and what the house has been. There is, I think, a substantial movement
in connection with this bill. The bill itself will help North Carolina
in areas that we desperately need help.</p>

...we have heard over and over again about how our tax rates are an
impediment to job creation, that the fact that we have the highest
marginal income tax rates in the southeast creates real problems from a
competitive standpoint for us. And that we have the highest corporate
income tax in the southeast creates those same sorts of problems. It is
my belief and I think the belief of a number of other folks, that
passing this substantial tax reform and substantial tax reduction to
allow the people of North Carolina and the businesses in North Carolina
to keep more of their money is going to have a substantial positive
impact on our economy and a positive impact on job creation. Because as
I said in the Finance Committee yesterday, is what we want to do is we
want to create an environment that is such that businesses, small and
large, can be productive and can be profitable. Because businesses that
are productive and profitable can grow. Businesses that are productive
and profitable will employ people. You don't have employees if you don't
have employers. What we want to do is increase the opportunity employers
to be successful and when they're successful, they will create more jobs
and they will hire more people. I urge your support for the bill, be
more than happy to answer any questions anyone has, and Mr. President, I
understand that Senator Rabin has an amendment.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Senator. Senator Rabin, for what purpose do
you rise?
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. President. To amend the bill.
Speaker Changes: Senator Rabin, you can send forth your amendment. The
clerk will read.
Speaker Changes: Senator Rabin of Brunswick moves to amend the bill.
Speaker Changes: Senator Rabin's recognized to explain the amendment.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment does two
things. In a few places it has purely technical corrections and in three
places it has clarifying changes. I'll go over those clarifying changes.
On page two, line twenty-four, the clarifying change notes that only the
main hospital at UNC Chapel Hill is included in the state tax refund.
Second clarifying change is on page four, I believe, line three, the
clarifying change defines the utilities covered in that section. The
final change is the final part of the amendment. which changes the
length and time of the duration of the gas tax cap to two years rather
than one year. It was... My original intention was to make that two
years than it was written as one year and the change is that the gas tax
will be capped for two years. I'd be happy to answer any questions.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker Changes: Further discussion or debate. Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise?
Speaker Changes: To see if the amendment sponsor will yield to a
question.
Speaker Changes: Senator Rabin, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: I yield.
Speaker Changes: Thank you. Senator Rabin, is there a fiscal note for
this? What is the impact to the general fund if we were to pass this
amendment? On the gas tax, sir?
Speaker Changes: There is no physical note attached to that, but I can
give you off the top of my head, you know the gas tax of course went up
by statute yesterday one tenth of one cent. Of course, a penny on the
gas tax is about 10 million dollars, but that will in six months be
about 3.3 million in revenues.
Speaker Changes: Follow up?
Speaker Changes: Senator Rabin, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: Yes, I yield.
Speaker Changes: So is the only provision that affects revenues in this
the gas tax piece?
Speaker Changes: Yes.
Speaker Changes: Follow up?
Speaker Changes: Senator Rabin, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: Yes, I yield.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Senator Rabin. Just to be sure I understood,
you said it was 3.3 million in the second year?
Speaker Changes: About 3.3 million actually that should be this year,
between now and January.
Speaker Changes: Thank you very much.
Speaker Changes: Thank you.
Speaker Changes: Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none.
Question before the Senate, passage of Amendment One. All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the vote. The
clerk will record the vote. Woodard, aye. Bryant, aye. Tarte. Forty-six
having voted in the affirmative and zero in the negative, Amendment One

further discussion or debate?

<p id="030:00">
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Berger. In listening to your comment, you indicate
that you had changed the cap on the amount of sales tax refunds that the
larger nonprofits would receive, or are receiving currently. Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. We changed the cap from the bill that was heard in the Senate a
couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so now that, you say, will be 2.85 million rather than whatever the
other amount was? Just to complete the question, how and why did you
choose that particular cap?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, in the bill that we heard a couple of weeks ago, what we
did is we phased the cap down from the current unlimited amount of
refund to ultimately the refund would be $100,000 phased in over several
years. What this bill does, is it also phases down the cap, or phases
down the refund, and the refund starts at ten, ten-and-a-half million
dollars. It then goes to $7 million, then to $5 million, and then to
$2.85 million. The reason we selected $2.85 million is that what we
found is that someone would have to spend, I think it's about $40
million in gross spending on sales-taxable items to get to the point
where the sales tax was $2.85 million. We looked around the state at the
various hospitals and the various charitable institutions. And what we
found is that well over 98%, maybe 99% of the nonprofits would fit below
that $2.85 million. The ones that are above, what we found is that they
generally are institutions that are organized as nonprofits, but in many
instances they are institutions that pay their executives and their
employees, particularly their senior management-type employees, six- and
seven-figure salaries. It was our feeling that in many instances that
those institutions, who are organized as nonprofits, don't pay any
property taxes--if they're medical institutions, they have basically a
monopoly under Certificate of Need--that those institutions probably,
when the amount that they would pay in sales tax represents less than 1%
of their operating budgets, could probably withstand this modification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So as I understand it, there are two universities and 10 or 12 health
systems that fall within what you just described. So you're specifically
targeting it toward that group as opposed to the other nonprofits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we did is we tried to address the smaller nonprofits that may be
running on particularly small gross revenue margins and were not
necessarily those institutions that have executives with six- and
seven-figure salaries. And what we found was that there were about 15 or
so that were above that figure, and it was our feeling that those 15 or
so were organized in such a way that for them to receive a taxpayer
subsidy, which is the refund of their sales tax, was something from a
policy standpoint we felt needed to be changed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. And ladies and gentlemen, I'd just like to
point out a very few things. Number one, Wake Med is one of the biggest
employers in Wake County. They have four or five thousand employees,
primarily in my district. It is a nonprofit, used to be a county
hospital, a nonprofit agency took it over. And you have to understand
what nonprofits do. Nonprofits do exactly what the name says. Nobody can
take the profits out. They have to rededicate the money that they
receive back to the charitable ??. Now it seems to me that if you've got
a nonprofit that is quite successful</p>

<p id="035:00">
They keep pouring the money back in to the charitable purpose, then they
get better at it. Now, let me give you a case in point. We talked about
Wake Mid, just, you know, twenty years ago.  Just a local Wake county
hospital owned by the tax payers and the commissioners were wise enough
in this county to organize a non-profit and it's still totally
controlled here in Wake county. Organized a non-profit to deliver health
care services better. To provide greater care to the energent population
of this county. That was part of the deal that they made when they
converted it to a non-profit. And if you look at the start of the
numbers, Wake Mid is consistently among the leaders in hospitals across
the state that deliver charitable, non-compensated care. So, if in fact
they are getting this benefit back by not having to pay sales tax on the
additions, and by the way, they've made some very extensive additions at
Wake Mid. What do they do? They're the leading heart hospital in the
state. They do more heart operations than any other hospital in the
state. What was a county hospital, now this non-profit. So, if  they
made a hundred million dollars or whatever the amount is, they gotta
turn it back in to deliver better charitable care, health care for the
citizens of Wake county. And I raise a question several weeks ago, and I
don't know because I haven't seen it specifically in this bill, Wake
county is blessed in many ways. Probably to a degree that no other area
in the state is. We have three major health systems operatin' in this
county. Three major health systems. The only county in the triangle that
does that. And, those hospitals compete with each other. I don't know
how the UNC hospital is treated in this scenario, but I guarantee you,
Rex  hospital will be building facilities that are valued at more than
two hundred plus million dollars. Because, their specialty in this
market is cancer care and those are very expensive hospitals to build.
Go a little bit further. Because of the success of these big hospitals,
they create jobs. Now, I believe you when you said you wanted to create
jobs, but I will assure you that if you put this strangle hold on these
health systems, you're going to destroy, probably in the neighborhood,
four, five thousand jobs immediately in this state. Because the money
just doesn't pop out of thin air. And, so, I urge you to think about how
you get new discoveries coming out of these hospitals in the triangle,
whether it's Duke,whether it's UNC. Which raises another issue. Why
should Duke and UNC be competing on different playing fields? They go
for the same patients. They treat the same patients. They have similar
charity care amounts. They deliver care to the energents, not only in
Duram and Wake county and Orange county, but all of those hospitals
serve people in the surrounding counties, whether it's Granville county,
Franklin county, Caswell county. And just look at the service of these
hospitals in the triangle. And so, as you destroy these jobs that
they've created because they've been very successful in upping the level
of care to most of the people who are treated at these hospitals, you
also destroy something else. Again, we're fortunate in the triangle and
it's got quaternary care hospitals. You know, those are the hospitals
that people travel from across the world to come get treatment, not
primary, secondary, tertiary care, but do the exotic things; transplant
lungs and hearts and every other organ and you. At Wake Forest, which is
one of the universities that you've targeted in this bill, you know,
some fellow down there learned how to grow organs and so they're growing
organs. For several years we helped fund their program to grow organs so
that they could then be transplanted into people. How do you think they
get the funds to do these exotic things? So, you improve the overall
health care. You improve the ability of the state to compete, not just
with rural North Carolina, but places around the country. So, you
compete with Austin, Texas. You compete with San Francisco. You compete
with Boston. And so, now this region is one of the major bio-tech
regions, one of the four major bio-tech regions in the country because
of what goes on in these hospitals and their... [end]</p>

[Speaker changes.] ability to do research and deliver ????? care and
again they do it because these things that you call profit are poured
back into the institutions.  It's not sittin' up on somebody's balance
sheet for shareholders so that somebody makes a private profit from it.
It has to be rededicated to the same charitable purposes that these
non-profits were created for anyhow.  Ya'know there was a lot of
discussion and a lot of pride, I think, in this area several years ago
when Senator Ted Kennedy chose to come to Duke above the Harvard
hospitals, the hospitals in California and the others that had
tremendous brain research going on.  These institutions don't get that
way just by being mediocre so you might not like the fact that they get
funds that you don't quite understand how it fits into the process but
these additional revenues substantially increase our sense of who we are
around the world and what the ability of these hospitals are...the ones
I know about.  And that same thing applies not only in the triangle but
I see that Wakeforest and Duke Universities are the only universities
effected by this and any given time, those health systems and
universities will be building 3-400 million dollars worth of facilities
in order to do the cutting edge research and the kind of stuff that's
necessary for them to stay on the forefront. I think we passed earlier
this self-liquidating bill for UNC. Go look at UNC and I will bet you,
in addition to what we're doing with the 50 million dollars a year for
the cancer center...that those kinds of facilities cost you between two
and five hundred million dollars and so, what are we doing, punishing
them for building things because they've become excellent in what they
do.  Punishing Wa??? for building a state-of-the-art heart hospital with
the hotel and things along with it so that people have somewhere to stay
when they come from other sections of the state to have heart surgery.
Ya' know one of the things that becomes rather obvious in what we're
trying to do here is to punish success and, for the life of me, I don't
understand why you want to do it and you guys are the last ones I
thought would punish success...because that's really what we're talking
about here and so I hope that you'll reconsider.  I know it won't change
your vote or anything but I hope that you'll reconsider what you're
doing to these institutions that are managed in the multi-billion dollar
annual range and you...you're angry at 'em because they pay an executive
a million dollars...or some number in that neighborhood. They are
competing for the very best people who do that kinds of things they do.
Now whether those people are in the private sector or the public sector,
they still have to compete for them and, if in fact, we're gonna keep
moving ahead with these institutions, especially the ones that are
world-class that we have in this state now, then you're gonna have to
get over it and realize that a million dollars, while a big number, is
insignificant to a four, five billion dollar annual operation and the
kinds of decisions that they have to make and the kinds of liabilities
associated with it. So I hope you'll rethink this somewhere along the
road.  I know you won't in your vote today but I do hope that you
reconsider what your attitude is toward these institutions that do such
a great job for North Carolina as they provide healthcare to the degree
that most places would be very envious of.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Stein has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you Mister President, Members of the
Senate...with all due respect to the bill's sponsor, this bill is not
tax reform.  This bill is a tax cut for the wealthy and large
out-of-state corporations on the backs of middle-class tax payers and
working families.  We've heard that this bill's simply returning money
to the tax payers.  Sounds nice but which tax payers?  Let's look at the
winners and losers of your tax bill here today.  Remarkably this plan
raises taxes on 80% of the state of North Carolina. Fifty-six percent of
the benefit of this tax plan goes to the wealthiest one percent. A
hundred percent goes to the top twenty percent.  Who pays for this shift
to the top? Well, it's the middle class because their taxes are ...</p>

?? up. Who else? Well, patients. We just heard Senator Blue talk about
the hospitals. Hospitals are going to have to eliminate services,
eliminate programs, lay off health care workers, and cease providing
critical health services to the people of this state. Who else?
Middle-class families trying to send their kids to college. You
eliminate the credit for the 529 program; 30,000 North Carolinian
families avail themselves of that to help afford college education for
their children. We've already raised tuition. You've eliminated
need-based financial aid for 9,800 students. And now you're making it
harder for people to afford a college education with this tax bill. Who
else? Home builders and renters. You propose to eliminate the state tax
credit that helps to construct work-force housing. It eliminates in
2018. This is particularly hard on rural economies where they can't
support high rents. This program creates about 7,000 jobs a year in the
construction trade and it generates $6 of private real estate
development for every $1 of public money invested. It adds millions to
the tax base, and as I said, supports jobs. Who else?
Nine-hundred-thousand hard-working taxpayers who benefit from the
earned-income tax credit today will no longer get that assistance with
this tax bill. You know that there are 64,000 military families in North
Carolina who draw the earned-income tax credit? That is often the
difference between living in poverty and being able to rent a home, buy
health insurance, provide child care for your family. Who else?
Retirees. You all are raising taxes on retirees. You got rid of the
Social Security fees, where you were raising taxes on Social Security in
the last bill. Guess you all caught a little too much heat. You get rid
of the $4,000 deduction that goes currently in North Carolina law for
retirees. You're raising taxes on retirees. But the biggest cost is
borne by the people of North Carolina as a whole. Because you all are
doing the easiest and most irresponsible thing an elected official can
do. You're claiming the political credit today but you're putting the
cost on the future, down the road. In the first two years this bill
costs the state about $670 million. We factored that into the budget,
which we voted on a couple weeks ago. In years three, four, and five, it
gets up to 2.8, 2.9 billion. It's over $1 billion for every year
thereafter. Senator Berger said that's enough. It's enough for the
state. How do we get the baseline number that you all have in your
projections? Two things: population growth and inflation. That's it.
Some of you all are business people, you understand the concept of
inflation. If you earn more money but you're having to pay more for the
inputs you haven't made any money. That's inflation. You understand the
concept of per capita. The more people in your state, the more kids you
have to educate, the more seniors you provide services to, the more
people who travel on your roads, the more prisoners, unfortunately, you
have to incarcerate. The more people, the more costs. Everything in this
projection is per-capita and inflation-adjusted. Anything that you take
off of that number, you're taking off of zero. It's zero growth. So
you're taking a billion dollars off of zero. It would be great if we
could ignore inflation and we could ignore the hundreds of thousands of
people who move to our state. But we don't have that luxury in the real
world. We've seen the consequences in your budget for this biennium of
the $700 million you all are proposed to cut in the next two years:
4,500 teacher assistants fired, 4,800 teacher positions eliminated,
increasing tuition on community-college students, eliminating thousands
of pre-kindergarten slots, eliminating need-based financial aid for more
than 9,000 students, and eliminating proven economic development
programs. We've been told that this giveaway is necessary for economic
development. There's no evidence that giving a tax cut to the wealthiest
1% is going to create jobs, particularly when you're cutting critical
government services to fund that tax cut. As I mentioned, 90% of the
corporate income tax credit cut will go to out-of-state shareholders.</p>

If you're concerned that our corporate income tax marginal rate is too
high, then lower it.  You don't have to go all the way to zero.  When
you go to zero, you're takin' one point two billion dollars out of our
general fund.  Which, by the way, is more than the entire community
college budget.  That's the choice you are making by going down to zero.
 How many more thousands of teachers you wanna' fire? How much more do
you wanna' raise tuition? How many more prisons do you wanna' close? How
many more need-based financial scholarships you wanna' eliminate? Will
we ever give the teachers of North Carolina a pay raise again? They are
currently 48th in the country in pay.  Do we want them to be 50th??
This bill is nothin' more than a political check to the tune of one
billion dollars per year that you all are signing, paid out to the
wealthiest and out-of-state corporations, drawn on the account of the
average tax payer in the form of higher taxes, larger classroom sizes,
worsening infrastructure, degraded universities and community colleges

legislation. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, to speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker changes.] You just heard a grand level democrat speaking the
grand level theme of &quot;we won't have enough money to run the
government&quot;.  If you wanna run on that folks, you go right ahead.
We don't have enough money to fund the government programs. You just
heard another conglomeration of half-truths...we're not increasing the
class size one student, we're not firing a single teacher, and the last
raise in four years that the teachers got, we gave it.  It was 1.2%.
Senator Stein, if I believed half of what you said, then I would believe
we'll have no growth by cutting taxes, by putting a billion dollars back
in the taxpayer's pockets. That money will be spent in the economy. That
money will be used by healthcare.  That money will be used any way that
the taxpayer wants to use it. And we will not be pickin' and choosin'
liberal giveaway programs because you think government needs more money.
 That big billion dollar tax cut is going into the pockets of people
that vote and that work and that pay taxes in this state. And, if you
wanna run on the &quot;we don't have enough money to run
government&quot;, you go right ahead.  When you tried that, we came in
here with a three billion dollar deficit.  We're just now working our
way out of it and a budget that will balance...that will make
sense...and a tax plan that will improve the economy.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Speak to the bill...
[Speaker changes.] Senator Brown has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President. Senator ????? I have a
ton of respect for...you know, talking about penalizing success?  When
we talk about penalizing success...look at our tax rate and talk about
penalizing success for the business community in this state for how many
years now? 6.9% corporate rate, highest in the southeast.  7.5% income
tax rate, highest in the southeast.  Unemployment rate? Fifth highest in
the nation. And you ask why?  And you look at policies that have passed
in the past few years and wonder why businesses don't like North
Carolina, don't wanna come to North Carolina?  We've talked about it and
there's no question in my mind, when you're not competitive on the front
end, you don't go there!  You go somewhere else.  And that's exactly
what has happened to businesses lookin' to relocate when they compare
North Carolina to other states in this nation.  We're not competitive.
That's just a flat fact.  Then you put the franchise tax on top of that
so we just added another tax, that we created not long ago...a ???? that
adds another burden to the business community on top of those
overburdening tax rates that we have now.  So if you wanna talk about,
you know, hurting success...that's exactly what we've done to this
business community in this state for many, many years.  Then we talk
about the growth of government, ya'know, the bill that you're lookin' at
now...increases growth by about six hundred million the first year, bout
eight hundred the second year, over a billion the following year.  How
much is enough? What's that answer?  Is it over a billion every year??
Is it two billion more a year? How much more government growth do we
need to sustain this state? I mean I think that's a good question.  Six
hundred million a year's not enough? I think it's enough.  I mean,
what's what's..the right answer?  How far do you wanna go? And then we
talk about what we've done to....

The least fortunate. You know, one good thing in what we've done
probably in the past 2 years is that about 1.2, 1.3 billion more dollars
to medicaid. I would say that's taking care of the less fortunate.
That's how much more we'll spend in 2 years, 2 years, on our Medicaid
costs in the state of North Carolina to take care of the less fortunate.
I think that's doing a pretty good job. So we talk about being
competitive and what we can do to get this state on the move, it's going
to be the smart businesses in this state that's going to make a
difference, I can promise you that. And when it comes to recruiting, if
you're not competitive, you don't win, you lose, because then what you
have to do with incentive money is you have to say what's it going to
take? How much have I got to give you to come to North Carolina. That's
how you promote your state because you're not competitive on the other
end, so now it's just how much have I got to buy you off for to get you
to come here, and that's why businesses say I want $50 million, I want
$60 million, because you're not in a negotiating position. Because you
can't sell your tax policy because you're out of whack, that's if they
even give you an opportunity to bid on the chance of them coming to your
state. I think this bill does a lot. I think it will help our
unemployment rate. I think it will make us competitive for first time. I
think it will start a whole lot new small businesses in this state. I
think it will put us at the front of the line when businesses look to
relocate. I think this will do a great service to this state. [SPEAKER

Mr. President, members of the Senate. Sometimes the arguments get a
little ridiculous around here. Sometimes people make statements like
100% of the benefits go to the top 20%. Find $1 that's not true and
that's a false statement. Moving forward, sounds a lot like what the
Budget and Tax Center seems to be saying about this bill you have before
you. We can make it a $4,000 loss and ignore the fact that everyone now
has a $15,000 standard deduction and say it's some kind of cut or
elimination. We can somehow say a reduction in the rate, even the bottom
rate in this state is a tax increase. We can somehow look at the
proportion of benefits and not compare that to who pays taxes but to
who's getting the benefits and say this is a skewed plan, all of which
are false. We can hear a lot about 10 businesses in the state and how
devastating it is to those businesses to not receive 6.5% of their
purchases over $48 million back to that business that sales type portion
and we can hear about how that's destroying innovation and the people
that are going to be laid off. I tell you to look at every major
corporation in the state then that we are charging 6.9% of their income
and ask what is not happening in this state. Not the select 10 that file
themselves as non-profits, but every other major corporation in this
state. What is the same innovation we're destroying? What is the same
businesses and jobs that are not able to be created because what we're
doing to all those other industries that exist in this state? This is
how we make a playing field in North Carolina that makes us competitive.
We take those corporations and we put them on a level playing field of
privileged businesses in this state. They all do great work for this
state, and they're all important to the economic future of North
Carolina. It's time we get out of the business of designing a tax code
for winners and losers, friends and buddies and it's time we look at
this system and say it's time we unleash economic power in North
Carolina. I believe firmly that this bill takes great strides in moving
in that direction. I believe that we underestimate revenue coming from
this bill simply because we do not factor for the growth we expect from
it. If we are ever going to solve our budget problem in North Carolina,
we're going to have to get our unemployment back down to 6</p>

I've heard an awful lot about leveling the playing field. The problem is
we've leveled that field we're you've back field it with sinking sand.
So those folks that are well off individuals. Those that are part of the
middle class, they're not better off they're sinking. They're financial
prosperity the wealth they have today is decreasing. They're spending
power will go down not up. Eighty percent are gonna be paying more not
less. That sinking sand people can't stand upon it. If you happen to be
one of those persons who has to go out there and buy manufactured
housing mobile homes. If you happen to be one of those who could only
afford the modular homes in this state and may I remind you over two
thirds of our residents fall in those categories. You're gonna pay more
not less. If you happen to be one of those individuals that qualifies
for low income housing, the low income tax credits that exist today well
if you're in an urban area, there's no incentive to even want to build
them there. They'll only be eligible in the tier one and tier two areas
that's it. Not only that but there gonna be gone. Twenty five year of
your reduction every year until it's completely gone. So what happens to
those occupants of those low income housing that would have had a place
to stay before. Incentives are gone. What happens to those buying the
manufactured housing and the modular homes that are worse off they're
sinking. What happens to all those individuals that in this state we
agreed to create kind of that safety net of opportunity. To provide that
door that they need to prosperity. That ladder that takes them from the
middle class and beyond. We haven't helped them. We can talk about
employers coming. We can talk about what's going to incentivize them. On
every list I've ever seen dealing with attractive sites for manufactures
to locate dealing with those environments that were absolutely conducive
to them creating jobs. They look at a good strong public education
system and we haven't done anything to help our K thru twelve education
system those that are in our public universities but most importantly
those employers that are considering North Carolina ?? skilled labor
force. We want to make sure they get the right jobs. But if we don't
invest in education we can't get them there so it gives me concern and
yes I've heard a lot about the non profits and I appreciate with the
rural hospitals and for those non profits that will be helped by raising
that floor up to the two point eight five million. But the problem is
there're major hospitals such as Dukeoever in Durham and yeah they're
gonna be hurting for two point four million dollars and you look at
what's gon' on there in the last several years during there sanction and
what do they do? They went out there and built a new six hundred dollar
investment in one facility three hundred million in another. Producing
substantial jobs. ?? spends six hundred million dollars not just the
impact within Durham but within the whole Piedmont area of North

impacts to the tune of a hundred million dollars. A hundred million
dollars approximately and what have they produced in recent years of
eleven thousand jobs additional jobs. As a result in their belief to
reinvest in the economy. Those are real numbers those are things we
should be concerned about. If you happen to be in that hospital trying
to absorb that ?? expense it's gon' be a true hardship. And most

You’re going to be worse off. And if you look at our economy as a state,
we will basically create a $1 billion hole.  A $1 billion hole. And if
we don’t see the growth occur in our economy that’s anticipated, to the
tune of about 4.4 percent average, typically you’re going to get about
4.1, 4.2, if these things don’t materialize the hole will be even
deeper. And we’re just going to keep cutting and cutting and cutting. I
respect the fact that we had to cut when the economy was bad. I respect
the fact that we can downsize and make intelligent decisions, but to
keep cutting and cutting and cutting on the backs of people that are
hurting, working class individuals and the middle class, that are
putting their stake, in many respects, in less competitive positions
because we’re not investing what we need to to make ourselves attractive
to these businesses. That’s a mistake.
[Speaker Change] Mr. President --
[Speaker Change] Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change] To debate the bill.
[Speaker Change] Senator Kinnaird has the floor. Speak to the bill.
[Speaker Change] We heard a drumbeat over and over and over that we need
to cut the corporate tax to attract business. But let’s look at the
facts. Year after year after year North Carolina was declared one of the
best business climates in the country: Forbes Magazine, Site Selection
Magazine, ChiefExecutive.net. Christian Science Monitor named us the
best for business on criteria that included taxes. Progress Energy on
their website even encourages business to move here because of our low
business cost. We even have on McCrory’s [sp?] website that this the
best state to do business. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy
did a side by side comparison of nine states with a high tax rate with
states with no income taxes on three dimensions of economic growth. On
two dimensions, real  per capita growth and real median household
growth, the high tax states outperformed, repeat, outperformed the low
tax rate. So what states have the lowest taxes and how are they doing?
Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska. Are these really the economic development
engines that we want to emulate? We have hoped for years for real tax
reform and we thought we were started down that path. This is not tax
reform and it doesn’t do what we really need it to do.
[Speaker Change] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change] To speak to the bill.
[Speaker Change] Senator Newton has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker Change] Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues of the Senate,
when I ran in 2010 I ran on a promise to fight for jobs. I ran on a
promise to fight for our economy, to improve it. I ran on a promise to
  fight for these things by reforming our tax code, cutting taxes,
providing tax relief to our businesses and employers in this state. I
ran to make us more competitive nationally and in our region here in the
south. Because you see, when I ran, for those of you on the back row who
have forgotten, when I ran we were the highest tax state in the
southeast and one of the highest in the nation. We were in economic
freefall. What was your solution? Raise taxes. Spend money. Raise taxes,
spend money. Regulate, raise taxes, spend money. That’s why I ran, was
to run against that, to do something about it. As has already been
stated, when I got here there was a 2 and a half, almost 3 billion
dollar shortfall; 2 and a half billion dollar debt on unemployment
insurance, basically our state credit card run to the max on a lot of
debt that wasn’t voter approved. We’ve already fixed that. Our
retirement plan was underfunded. State health plan was underfunded. We
were overregulated with ridiculous rules that we’ve already made a good
stab at replacing, of fixing twice with regulatory reform. Because of
the horrible shambles that the minority party had left this state, we
had to spend the last two years basically fixing your mess and  righting
this state and trying to get it on the right track. Finally now we have
gotten to the point where  we can actually provide some substantive tax
relief, some sub--…</p>

To the citizens of this state, I am so pleased to finally have an
opportunity to vote for a bill like this. Now does this bill do enough?
No, actually I wish this bill did more. But I'll take what I can get,
because this is the best we're going to get.  We'll come back next year,
we'll come back the year after that, and we'll try to do it some more. I
applaud all my colleagues who have worked so hard to get here. I
certainly hope the governor in the house will take this legislation,
chew on it, mull on it and listen to their citizens and vote yes on this
bill. Because it's about time that we put this state new again. It's
about time that we got this economy going. It's about time that we do
something to fix the mess that we were left. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further discussion of it. Senator Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, members of the senate. We
hear a lot of talk about economic development, jobs, etc. etc. The truth
of the matter is this is all about tax cuts for the wealthy, that’s what
it’s about. This isn’t tax reform, this isn’t economic development. It’s
giving tax cuts to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. I
looked at it. Same song, third verse. It's not any better but it
couldn't get worse. The worst is the one you all created a website for.
And you constantly tried to nibble around the edges and make this thing
get better but you keep coming back with the same thing. Raise taxes on
the middle class families, give massive tax relief to the wealthy; every
time the world descends on you, the uproar is so loud that you can hear
it. You go away and you come back and do the same thing over again. The
plan today raises taxes on the bottom 80 percent in order to give tax
cuts to the top 1 percent. That’s the same thing that you had in your
first bill and you’re creating a billion dollar hole that someone’s
gotta dig out of. It's my understanding the governor is the number one
critic of that billion dollar hole because he’s gotta govern this state.
Now i'll tell you, you can keep doing it but it's not fooling the people
of this state and the working people of this state and the unemployed of
this state deserve better. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Abodaca for what
purpose do you rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton you’re exactly right we inherited a
mess, y'all buried us in three to four billion dollars worth of negative
revenues and just kept spending, kept taxing, kept spending, kept
taxing. Now we still have some of the highest. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s
that simple. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to speak the second time briefly
on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger has the floor to speak the
second time on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Senate, I
listened, as you did to a number of the things that were said about this
bill and about the consequences. And I was reminded of something that
President Reagan said when faced with a similar situation he said you
know the problem with some of these folks is they just believe so many
things that just aren’t so and I have no doubt that folks on the back
row fervently believe what they’re saying but they’re just not so. To
say that what this bill will do is reduce the money the state will
receive by a billion dollars of what we’re currently receiving is just
not so and the first year under this plan the revenues will increase by
600 million dollars. 600 million dollars and the second year it’ll
increase by about.</p>

[Speaker changes.]  ...until about the fourth year, the increase is
almost a billion dollars over...over the previous year so what we're
looking at is not a question of reducing the revenue available to the
state, now, quite frankly, I've got some constituents and I'll bet
you've got some constituents who say that we oughta' be spending less
and not more.  What we're talking about is a tax plan that actually
increases revenue but at a more reasonable rate so that we don't end up
with the kind of &quot;run away growth&quot; in government that we've
seen in the past. The kind of tax and spend policy that we've seen in
the past, the kind of thing that has been fueled by some of the
arguments that we've heard today in the nature of class warfare...some
of the arguments that we've heard today that just are not based on
factual information. What I would ask you to do is look at the bill,
consider the reality that we've got people and we've got businesses out
there that are hurting and one of the reasons they're hurting is because
this government has got too much of a hand in their pockets and what
this bill does is it leaves more money in the pockets of small
businesses, large businesses, middle class people and just about
everybody in the state of North Carolina.  I ask you to support

Senator Brown is recognized to explain the amendment.
Thank you mister president. What this amendment does is basically say
that before counties and cities shall not in the course in the process
in recording technical review
of an application for a permit or a plan submitted for approval. Require
revisions to that part of the application or plan that constitutes the
practice of engineering that has been part of the application or plan
that constitutes or that supervise...I'm sorry let me get this straight,
revisions that are part of the application plan that constitutes the
price of engineering and that has been supervised and sealed ?? plan
that you need an engineer or intern that's supervised by an engineer to
change that plan. I'll be glad to answer any questions.

Senator Brown do you yield?

I will.

Maybe everybody in the room knows what you're doing except me. But I
don't and who are we limiting and why do we not want to review
engineering work and who are we limiting from reviewing that why are we
doing that?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
We're not limiting the review at all. But what we are saying is that if
an engineer has sent in a plan, put a stamp seal on it. Before a city or
county could change that. It needs to be looked at by another engineer
or an intern under the supervision of an engineer not just an employee
that duttin' have an engineering degree at all that duttin' know
anything about how a plan was put together.

that daily I get many many emails and letters and calls concerning
fracking and what it will do to Chattam county. And one of the areas
that they are most concerned with is what happens to their water supply
and in this bill on page six they particularly take out the section in
which the chemicals that are used in the process will be revealed to the
public. This is of great concern to the people in Chattam county and I

that are in these chemicals, and, interestingly, I'm not the only one
who shares this concern. So does the Mining and Energy Commission, and
they have even written a letter objecting to this. This is only one of
many of the parts that are bad under this, but this to me is the most
egregious for the people of Chatham county, and for this reason I am
voting against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Jackson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill again and explain it.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to go ahead. I didn't not get through the whole
deal here, so let me go do that and then, Sen. Kinnaird, I'd like to
address your question which is a valid question. I'll go ahead do that
now. Basically what this you're talking about referring to in Section 7,
it is not that they do not report the chemicals. They are reporting
every chemical that is used in the fracking process. What they have
asked  -- and ?? asked requested this -- they do not want the recipe.
They want all the chemicals so if anyone was to ask, they could supply
the names of the chemicals that are being used, but they do not want the
recipe as they're being mixed together, as I understand it. So following
up on that Part 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 25, 30, 33 and 35 are all
recommendations that have been run through ?? and through the House and
through the Senate staff, and I'm agreeable to those. And then the new
parts of the bill are Part 7, as we've just briefly spoke on, Part 8,
Part 11, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 31 and 34. And I'll be glad to attempt to
answer any questions, and I have staff on stand-by should you have any,
and I understand there is still a couple more motions amendments to come
forth on this bill. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. McKissick has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I do have some deep concerns about this bill,
and I'm sure those who are involved with the Mining and Energy
Commissioner are very concerned about it, too. It appears that they have
sent a letter in that's gone out to those here in the House and the
Senate basically saying that they do not like the provisions here
dealing with the fracking chemicals being trade secrets. We do not need
to undercut the authority of this commission. We charge this commission
with doing extraordinarily important work and trying to craft
appropriate rules and regulation dealing with fracking in North
Carolina. If they are in the process of coming up with appropriate rules
that govern the use of the chemicals that are used by the companies that
will be involved in fracking, then we need to give them the opportunity
to do so. We need to allow them to craft it. We need allow them that
opportunity to listen to whatever experts they need to, conduct whatever
public hearings they may choose to --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] -- but most importantly --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Sen. McKissick will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. McKissick, will you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. McKissick, you still have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, and I guess that as a result of looking at what
I understand to be their dire concern, which was apparently the
consensus of a majority of the board, we need to listen to them. That's
what we charge them with. We need to give them that authority. We do not
need to be in the process of trying to shield and protect what these
chemicals are. We need to make certain that information is publily
available, protected in terms of appropriate confidentiality, but it
needs to be provided to ?? so that we know what we're getting into.
Because these are some serious chemicals going into the ground that do
have the potential to contaminate groundwater in this state. There are
other provisions in here that I get concerned about. There's a provision
here that says there's not going to be a physical note required when it
comes to fracking restrictions. Well, we require physical notes when it
comes to other rules and regulations. There's no reason why we should
not apply when it comes to horizontal drilling and fracking. There are
provisions in this bill that talk about repealing the Mountain Resources
Planning Act. Well, they are doing good work. Those up in the mountains
of this state have a reason to be concerned about the environment. They
have extraordinarily steep slopes. They have environments that are
unique, that are uncharacteristic to other parts of our state. We don't
need to be repealing the Mountain Resources Planning Act. It's [CUTS

Talk about provisions in here that talk about extending the boundaries
that are applicable to areas for groundwater quality standards to going
all the way out to the outer perimeter of the property line rather than
500 feet that currently exists, that gives me concern. Talking about the
opportunity when their water permit is issued to decrease the time when
there will be an opportunity for people to contest the issuance of those
kinds of permits, we need to be careful. We need to protect what we can
in North Carolina. Our environment is one of those things that all of us
appreciate. It gives us a quality of life which we all share, which
brings people here to this state whether it's to our coastlines, to our
mountains, to our Piedmont area. We should be very careful about
compromising our environmental regulations here in North Carolina. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Newton, you can send forward your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Should be
?? on the dashboard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Clerk will read. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Newton is recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate hearing for Senator
McKissick and Senator Kinnaird about their concerns about their concerns
about future energy sector that we're going to have in this state and
hydraulic fracturing and there seems to be a great deal of
misunderstanding about what the proper role of our state is in this
process of the materials and substances that are used in hydraulic
fracturing fluid, and the Mining and Energy Commission as well seems to
misunderstand what the role of the state should be, so this amendment
would clarify what we've already got in law and make it clear that the
state will not take possession or ownership of trade secrets. Now
Senator Kinnaird, you don't need to worry. The Mining and Energy
Commission and DNR will know what the materials are. They will know what
the substances are, they just will not know what the recipe is. Now let
me put this into context for everybody who's listening. I like
Coca-Cola. I drink Coca-Cola on occasion. It goes into my body, if it
was bad for me other than it might cause me to gain weight I would hope
that we might be able to figure out what was in it that was hurting me,
but we don't know what the recipe is. Now on the back of that can, they
tell you what's in it. They don't tell you what the formula is, they
don't tell you what the secret recipe is, but they tell you what's in
it, and that's what this amendment would do. Would make it clear that
the state does not take ownership of these trade secrets, and let me
tell you why I think this is important. First of all, if we did it in
this area, it would be different from all the other trade secrets that
the state deals with and second of all, I don't think the state, Senator
McKissick, should have to defend the trade secrets of any company, I
think that's their job. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To see if the amendment sponsor will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand Coca-Cola, that they put every
single ingredient including the chemical name and what's the secret
sauce is their relative ratios of those products, ingredients, and yes,
that is a trade secret, but every single ingredient is listed, and I'm
looking at this amendment on page 2 lines, essentially start on line 3
or 4 where it talks about chemical families  and then it says or other
suitable description of those chemicals and constituents, and chemical
family means a group of chemicals that share similar chemical properties
or have a common general name, so the way I've heard it talked about out
in the halls is if it's rat poison, it'll say it's rat poison, but it
won't tell you what rat poison it is, so I think there's a big
difference between the two if my understanding is correct, and I was
hoping you could speak to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stine, the
substances that are used in this process are generally found underneath
your kitchen sink, it's the ratios that are the trade secret. The intent
of this is to make it available to DNR for them to know whatever it is
that they need to know. It is clear that that has to be turned over if
there was a need of, a public need for that, so as far as your getting
into the chemistry of chemical families, I'm not sure I can answer that
question directly, but that's the intent of this amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
have a follow up question if I may, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Newton, do you yield for a follow up question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the Mining Commission have a position on your
amendment?</p>

No idea.  This amendment.  Senator Stein is to make it clear what their
charge should be and what it was all along and what it was intended to
be.  They seem to not quite understand that.  But there has been a great
deal of conversation with DENR on this, and DENR is, as I understand it,
asked for a similar type amendment.  I'm not sure if they've looked at
the actual language of it or not, but there's been a great deal of
conversation with them on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I think for those two reasons I'm going to be
voting against this amendment.  One is, we don't know what the actual
composition is.  I think it's not quite right to say it's like Coke, cuz
if we knew what all the chemicals were, I think that would be one thing,
but this board language under chemical family weakens it substantially.
And I think that the expertise in the mining commission is the place to
decide this.  They've been very articulate with their frustration.  You
know, I can quote them.  You can't have industry come in and say it is a
trade secret so I'm not going to disclose it to the chair of the
commission.  Someone needs to verify that.  He, the chair of the
commission, said that he was blindsided by this effort, so I will be
voting against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage of amendment 4.  All in favor vote aye,
opposed will vote no.  5seconds will be allowed for the voting.  Clerk
will record the vote.  Apodaca.  Apodaca no.  35 having voted in the
affirmative and 12 in the negative, amendment 4 is adopted.  The bill as
amended is back before the body.

Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate, you can send forward your amendment.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.  This amendment is much narrower in scope than
the ones we've been hearing, and I hope that I can shortly sit down.
Session log 2013-50 which passed recently, transfers Ashville's water
system to a metropolitan sewage district.  When this law passed, it
included a provision limiting its application to public water systems
that had not been issued an interbasin transfer certificate.  House Bill
94, however, eliminates this provision from the law, thereby making the
transfer provisions applicable to Greenville's water system.  That's
Greenville, which is 330 miles away from Ashville.  This creates a
threat that Greenville's water system will be transferred to the ??
sewerage district.  A small, metropolitan sewage district located in
Pitt County.  The ?? sewage district has a limited staff, and the
transfer of the Greenville water system to such a small entity is
neither practical nor a reasonable action.  The Greenville water system
is a tremendous asset to the Greenville utility service area, and having
it transfer of the assets and liabilities occurred by operation of law
without any compensation to the city of Greenville would not be
beneficial to Greenville or its citizens, nor any of the persons served
by Greenville utilities.  Senator John Davis of Green County, who also
represents Pitt County with me, is absent today, but he called me today
to let me know that he supports this amendment, as I hope all members
will.  Thank you Mr. President.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send forward your amendment, the clerk will

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade moves to amend a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade is recognized, explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. This amendment directs the
Commission for Public Health to clarify its rules that prohibit smoking
in bars and restaurants. By doing this is will ensure consistency in
interpretation and enforcement, and it also would have them clarify the
definition of enclosed areas for this purpose. I'd be happy to answer
any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In bars and restaurants. Right now they need to be
clarified so that they're enforced and they're consistent in the same
manner in every area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the senator a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is this the same amendment that was defeated in
committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No it is not sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the amendments sponsor will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I'm looking in the amendment on lines 19
through 22 and there are a lot of statutory cites, which is rules
adopted pursuant to the sixth section shall be exempt form the
requirements of, and then are not subject to, and there are a lot of
statutory cites. Can you explain what those provisions are and why they
have those exceptions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I can. The first one will exempt them from a
fiscal note, the second exempts them from rules reviewed by the
commission and the third one would send them back for legislative
review.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant did you have a question? For what
purpose do you rise senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To be heard on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You want to speak to the amendment? Senator Bryant has
the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just wanting to, it looks like this may be okay,
but I just, because of all these statutory references I know I'm wanting
to object the third reading so I can make clarify what it actually does
since this is the first time I've ever seen it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We don't have third reading on amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is just an amendment senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I Understand this is an amendment, I'm talking about
on the bill. Obviously I mean if this passes and it's in the bill, I
would be concerned about having more time to understand what it really
does, that was my only point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn't mean object to third reading to the amendment
of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator. Senator Nessbitt for what purpose
do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. President, would the lady yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why do we want, why all of a sudden are we taking this
set of rules and exempting them from everything? Exempting them from
rules reviewed. There's a process, and just let me make a statement.
There's a process by which you adopt rules and the public has a chance
to have input and it goes through a process, we don't have to worry with
it and it works pretty well. So why are we saying that these rules
aren't subject to any of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think they need to come back before the legislative
body just to make sure it's an open process.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[00:12] is recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate I have been watching
and maybe we are doing it all the time but I hope not. We have a rules
process so that we don’t have to do all the steps. We pass a law and
give it to the agency to implement rules and the only way you can
delegate that responsibly is that if the people have a chance to watch
it and make the rules and object and then if something wrong bring it
back to us so can fix it and we let the process work but this is a
convoluted way of getting at here and I think those things to do is not
passes amendment now and if it’s imperative or it’s a good thing we can
put it on another bill where it can go through a committee and we can
see it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson what purpose you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I hope I wanna make this clear I will do my best to ask you some of the
questions that this amendment basically will clarify that the public
health department has the final authority to make rule on whether you
can smoke inside or outside but currently there seems to be there are
rules all over the place as in the lot of cases in the state and this
bill basically, this amendment excuse me will just clarify that the
public health department has a final say on what the rules will be and
how they will be administered and I would appreciate this forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[01:54] what purpose you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson yells to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson do you yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reluctantly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you draw us an amendment that says that so I can vote for it
because I’m not sure that this one says a whole lot more than that. It
says they are gonna write the rules and there is not gonna be proper
side of those rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President to respond, Senator ___[02:18] that is not the intent of
this amendment I assure you with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[02:27] what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Jackson a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson do you yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is going on now in the way of rules are local public health
departments writing rules I mean what is existing system now that this
would be replacing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President to respond, Senator ___[02:53] the best I understand I
have been told personally is that they are all over the board, one
county may have one set of rules another county may have another set and
municipality may have a totally different set within the same county.
So, this was an effort to make it uniform all across the states so folks
would know what the laws are and the county folks and city folks would
know how to enforce it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President in my own county we had an issue related to what Senator
Jackson was just talking about where a local restaurant operator a
number of different franchises across the state and it so happened then
in my county they interpreted the statue much more narrowly and actually
either know they will operating an outside smoking area with so many
egresses and entrances and exits and a wall here but not a wall on three
sides, they ended up interpreting it completely different than anybody
else in the state and shutdown their outside smoking area and I do think
from what I saw happen and so what I felt like it was arbitrary of local
entities getting into this and not having any laws that were actually
setout, I can definitely see a reason for it for what I experience in my
own county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer has an excuse to absence for the remainder the
afternoon. Senator Raid what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Raid has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanna to clarify a couple of things to commission for public
health already has rules and there will be an interpreted differently,
in different counties and they are not being enforced to saying, “This
is merely telling not changing the rules but telling them to amend and
clarify the rules so that they can be interpreted and enforced
consistently throughout the state of North Carolina.” It’s not writing
new rules it’s clarifying…

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask Senator Wade a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is just a simple question. Why don't they bring people together and
have a meeting or a seminar and tell them what the way these rules
should be interpreted as opposed to going back through the process. It
sounds like the rules are already, generally in place. Why are we going
back and administratively establishing a new process of procedure for
doing so because it would seem to be easy just to disseminate either a
flyer or a sheet in the mail or something that would provide appropriate
information for consistent application as opposed to going through this
process. Have they attempted doing that and that effort has failed or
why are we resorting to this as what I would consider to be a last
effort to address what appears to be a problem. I don't know how
frequent this problem has occurred or whether it's occurred on a
widespread basis or that there's one or two incidences where simple
clarification would do the job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, may I answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, you have the floor to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, first, obviously there's some problems with interpretation so
we need to clarify those. Sending the flyer out or getting together with
a group is not going to be able to straighten that out for generations
to come or people coming behind that staff. We need to have it written
so it's clarified and you can go through the law and the rules to see
what and interpret it the same. We don't need to have one group of
people interpret one way and another the other. You need to have it
written out. Any rule should be able to be interpreted somewhat the same
with consistency and I think this is what this is morally trying to do.
Have consistency since we already know that different localities are
interpreting it differently therefore we need to clarify that there's
that problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I just want to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would seem to me we already have rules and regulations in place that
just simply need to be completely understood. There may be an occasional
misinterpretation but I think that could happen anywhere dealing with
building codes and regulations or anything else. You simply clarify it
and there may be some local interpretation that may not be consistent
with what the intent was so I'm not completely convinced that this is
something we need to do. I certainly don't want to think that the goal
here is to undermine, in any respect, the prohibitions that presently
exist on smoking in bars and restaurants. If there's any goal here
that's an undercurrent to undermine that then that would deeply disturb
me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson has the floor to speak on the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I didn't know I was going to spend more time on this amendment than the
bill but I just wanted, and it came back to me, I was refreshed, staff
refreshed my memory. They currently only have three rules and they
really need to clarify those. They're so broad they're being interpreted
totally ever how you see fit. Senator McKissick, I'm sure you might
interpret it differently than I would. So we're asking them to go back
and make some more rules and clarify those rules with this amendment.

Qualifies as a material revision to a charter application. Section one
would define the term sibling to include half siblings, step siblings,
and children residing in a family foster home if they all reside in the
same household. It will allow a charter school to give enrollment
priority for children of full time employees. It would add a limitation
for the enrollment priority allowed for children of full time employees
and children of the initial members of the board of directors in the
first year of the schools operation to 10% of the schools total
enrollment. Create a new class of enrollment priority for students who
were enrolled in the charter school within the two previous school years
but left the school early for one of two reasons, to participate in an
academic study abroad program or a competitive admission residential
program, or because of the vocational opportunities of the students
parents. It would allow a charter school to enter all siblings into a
lottery together under one surname.
Section two would expand to offer grades four and five if the charter
school has previously been authorized to offer grades kindergarten
through grades three. Expand to offer grades seven and eight, if the
charter has previously been authorized to offer grade six, and expand to
offer 10, 11 and 12 if the charter school has previously been authorized
to offer grade nine. And Mr. President at the appropriate time I'd like

simply would do one thing, it would allow these charter schools to only
expand one grade higher than the charter school currently offers. And so
if they currently offer ninth grade they would only be able to go to
tenth grade the next year, the year after that eleventh, the year after
that to twelfth.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Sanderson do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm assuming that would be about 100 per grade?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can't give you those exact numbers, I really don't
have those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Sanderson do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Have they expressed concern about the dilution for the
high school population?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, the local school board has expressed a great
deal of concern about what this Arapahoe Charter School would like to
offer and any other charter school that finds themselves in a similar
situation, they have adamantly opposed this from the very beginning. But
to me this comes down and to my constituents, especially the parents of
the charter school, that this comes down to a school choice issue for
parents. This particular charter school only wants to be able to offer
an additional grade so that the students who are already enrolled in
that charter school, the students who are already in grade nine, will
have grade 10 available to them so that they do not have to change
schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none the question before the senate is the passage of amendment one. All
in favor vote aye, opposed vote no, 5 seconds will be allowed for the
voting, the clerk will record the vote. 38 having voted in the
affirmative and 7 in the negative, amendment one is adopted the bill as
amended is back before the body. Is there any further discussion or
debate? Senator Tillman for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To offer two simple amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you can send forward your amendment. Did you
say two amendments senator, what's the first one you want to offer up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's take the one on top.</p>

?? Senator Tillman moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Tillman is recognized and explain the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
This amendment simply says that after one year of operation, the charter
school will make an effort to have a population that will reflect the
ethnic and racial makeup of the LEA or the surrounding area that it
draws from. That's all it does.
[Speaker Change]
Is there any discussion or debate?
[Speaker Change]
Senator Anderson, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President, I would support this is a good amendment and I
would support this amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
To see if Senator Tillman will yield for a question.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Tillman, will you yield?
[Speaker Change]
For you, anything Senator.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. There was a concept like this in the original bill that was
moved from one part of the bill to the front, and I don't have the paper
in front of me. How does this differ from what's in the underlying bill?
[Speaker Change]
This simply restates, and I believe the other legislation's language may
be out of the, the House has done a lot of work on this charter bill
since it's been over there, Senator, and I understand this needs to be
back in there to make our intent clear that that's what we want to do
with the makeup of the school.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up question.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Tillman, do you yield for follow up?
[Speaker Change]
I do.
[Speaker Change]
So, I'm looking at page one, lines 25 through 32, is it different than
that?
[Speaker Change]
Well the House bill sponsor thought we needed this. What page are you
on?
Senator, Mr. president, what page are you on?
[Speaker Change]
I was on page one. I'm sorry. I was on page one of the bill, lines 25.
My astute colleagues have pointed out the difference, Senator Tillman,
if you'd like me to answer my own question.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Stein, why don't you go ahead and answer your question to
Senator Tillman.
[Speaker Change]
What the amendment does is lower the standard for achieving diversity by
making it 'try to do it' rather than 'they shall do it', and for that
reason I'm going to be voting against the amendment, although I'm sure
offered in good faith.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Tillman, you are recognized.
[Speaker Change]
To respond.
[Speaker Change]
To respond.
{Speaker Change]
Pick on the amendment. You can not guarantee a new charter school or any
other charter school that will be able to quickly make these things and
ratios hard and fast. We can not do that. They just can not adapt to do
that. And this says that we'll make every effort to do so. That's all it
does, it just clears it up enough to make it something that is a goal
worthy of trying to do.
[Speaker Change]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the is the passage of amendment two. All in favor vote 'Aye',
opposed vote 'No'. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the
court will record the vote. 34 having voted in the affirmative and 11 in
the negative, amendment two is adopted. The bill, as amended,is back
before the body. Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Tillman?
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President, to send forth the second amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Senator, you can send forth your second amendment. The clerk will read.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Tillman moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Let's wait one second, Senator, while that amendment- There it is.
Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President, I believe everybody's got it but Senator Bingham, but to
explain the amendment, that will simply say that we're going to continue
to try to expand this bill a little bit to say that those children
eligible to be taken in  automatically would be employee's children. The
original bill just had principals, teachers, and teacher assistants.
This says all employees. We've got some charter schools with like 15, 20
kids, and if you had 17 kids and you only had 10% that you could allow
in, that would be 1.7 children. Solomon might could've handled that but
we need to at least have it 20%. That means that you could take in a
couple. If we have it 20%, if you had 20 kids you could take in 4 and
that just gives us a little more leeway to take in another</p>

Clerk will read it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 296 -- Omnibus Wildlife Resources
Commission Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Tucker is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, thank you. Members of the Senate, I
bring you this Wildlife Resources Commission Act. This bill will allow
the adjustment in fees for hunting fees, fishing fees,  et cetera. It
also incorporates  a bear stamp. It also allows the charge of the
Wildlife Commission to manage bears and bear hunting over bait. I've
become an expert in that in the last four days. All of you have received
a number of calls from these very civil folks that are objectionable to
that, and there will be an amendment, Mr. President, by Sen. Hise on
this before we get into discussion of the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Hise, you can send forward your amendment. The
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Hise moves to amend to bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Hise is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate.
The purpose of this amendment, really looking at the licenses we sell,
this will remove the increase on the lifetime licenses for individuals.
This includes those licenses available to infants, children, adults,
adults over70, as well as disabled individuals and disabled veterans,
all of which have different rate categories. This keeps those lifetime
licenses at their current rates, except for the non-residents. It lets
the non-residents continue to go up as moving forward. It also
eliminates the increase in the Mountain Heritage Designated Trout Waters
three-day. This is something that is used a lot in my district, purchase
a lot by children who are learning to trout fish and others and moving
forward. The entire impact of this amendment, when research came out
with their analyst for this, they did both a 10% and a 20% resistance.
If you look at a 10% resistance, the total impact of keeping these rates
the same would be about $161,000. If you go to a 20% resistance, keeping
the rates the same would actually be a $133,000 increase. So I guess
it's somewhere between those two numbers pretty close to zero if you
would average those two together. So I'd appreciate your support of this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Tucker has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank [CUTS OFF]</p>

Sir, Senator Hise and I have worked together on this and I would
certainly be in favor of this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Any further
discussion or debate on amendment one? Hearing none, the question before
the Senate is the passage of amendment one. All in favor will vote aye.
Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The

Tucker, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President, to
speak the second time on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Tucker has
the floor to speak the second time. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr.
President. Just to go into a bit more length on the bill it does adjust
the fees, it does establish a black bear stamp, it also allows the
Wildlife Commission to set the rules for controlling the bear
population. The bear hunters are not in favor of this, let me just go
ahead and state that. They have a great deal of concern.  About the
Wildlife Commission taking over. The management of the bear population
argument on the other side is is that they manage almost everything else
in the state. We have received assurances from the Wildlife Commission
executive director and also their board, that they will do everything
that they can to be amenable to the bear hunters. This discussion has
been going on a number of years, so we want to take this opportunity to
put it up under Wildlife so that they can begin to manage the bear
population. We’ve all seen them on t.v, the side of the road, and we
have a bear sanctuary state. The bear hunters to a great job feeding the
bears. The population has grown and grown and grown. It’s my hope that
the Wildlife Commission and the bear hunters will be able to work
together. It also moves the age when you can receive a license from 65
to 70. So I’ll have to wait on that. Also, too, it provides that no more
than 25% of the Wildlife Resources Commission authorized operating ??
shall be kept in reserve. We have also, in this budget process, both in
the Senate and the House, have reduced their budget, in some cases
substantially, to raise these fees gets to a better situation from
revenue stand point for the Wildlife Commission so that in time they
will become self sufficient and less dependent upon the state. I’ll be
glad to answer any questions. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there any

Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, I'd like to thank Senator Parmon for bringing this
forward.  Just making the body aware.  Senator Bingham brought this up
in our committee meeting.  We have over 500,000 incidents of people
passing school buses a year in North Carolina documented by the school
bus drivers.  And I know we're strapped for money, but there is
technology available that can take a picture of the vehicle coming
toward the school bus with the stopped arm out.  As the individual
passes, it takes a picture of who is driving the car, and then as it
goes back behind the school bus, it takes a picture of the driver's
license.  I know we can raise and reduce fines, but I can tell you these
children are in danger and one of these days we'll have to spend the
dollars because those cameras will stop it.  We've had a study plan in
place in Rowan County, and they have gotten over 80% convictions.  A lot
of time people just I give, they got them on tape.  It's no question
about the fact of the violation, so the technology is available.  So
thank Senator Parmon for moving forward.  I'm sorry about that student
in Forsyth County.  Thank you.
