  Welcome to HHS everybody, good morning. First of all let&#39;s start by
introducing everybody our sergant at arms today on the hose side are
Young Bay, Bill Morris, Jim Moran. From the senate side Jim Hamilton and
Anderson Medows. We also have some pages today and from the house side
we have Abbie Martin from Wilson representative Susan Martin. Brianna
Moore who&#39;s sponsor is Mike Hagar and Kiera Newsome from Mcklenberg
Kelly Alexander. From the Senate side the pages are Regan Weights
Senator Chad Barefoot is sponsor and Racheal Bass senator John
Alexander. Today we&#39;re going to be talking about the budget as you
all know and I&#39;d like to go ahead and introduce Pam Copatrick of the
office of state budget and management for presentation. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning to the chairs and to the members of this committee. Do I
have to hold the button the whole time? There. We thank you for having
the state budget office here this morning to present to you some
highlights from governor Mccrory&#39;s recommended 2015, 2017 state
budget for the department of Health and Human Services. We have about
twenty five slides and I don&#39;t plan to spend the whole time talking
I want to be sure we leave plenty of time to answer questions that the
committee members may have. We&#39;ve got our team from the state budget
office here on this row with me and we also coordinated with the
department of Health and Human Services to be sure that key
representatives are here should your questions go further into the
details of agency specific activities and operations. So again thank you
for having us and I&#39;ll go ahead and get started. So the total
recommended budget for the department of Health and Human Services is
close to nineteen billion dollars in the current year from total
spending from all sources. The departments budget is heavily federally
and other receipts supported and in the current year has a net
appropriation of five point one billion dollars. The recommended budget
is presented in the two right hand columns of the slide that we&#39;re
looking at and the percent change that you see is a calculation of
change as compared to the current authorized budget. Spending over the
biennium grows to more than twenty billion dollars by 2017 and the total
investment over the two year period is then point eight billion dollars.
So focusing on the state appropriation investment in DHHS again first
year funding is recommended at five point three billion dollars and it
grows to five point five billion dollars in 2016-17. Seventy three
percent of the appropriations that are enacted for DHHS go to Medicaid
and health choice, mental health mental disabilities and substance abuse
services represent about seven hundred and fifty I&#39;m sorry seven
hundred and ten million dollars and then the balance of everything DHHS
does which includes public health, public health infrastructure, social
services, services to the ageing, the blind, the deaf, the hard of
hearing, the disabled, and vocational rehabilitation comes out of that
remaining portion of the states investment in DHHS.  Overall DHHS is
just under twenty four and a half of the total state budget of twenty
one point five billion dollars. Investments in the budget represent
administration priorities. The governor&#39;s budget makes investments
in mental health, community mental health initiatives, state facility
needs and makes further investments in the DOJ settlement so that people
with mental illness can live safely in their community. The
governor&#39;s budget also addresses chronic shortfalls in the state
operated facilities. The governor is recommending major investments in
public health infrastructure through the medical examiners system, vital
records, and also funding a shortfall in the public health lab. The
governor&#39;s budget contains

  Continues an appropriation enacted by this body in the current year from
nonrecurring funds to continue slots in the pre-K program. By way of
explanation when we approached developing the recommended budget rather
than looking just at division by division, and we know that the
legislature enacts distinct appropriations for each of the divisions of
the Department of Health and Human Services, but as we looked at
prioritizing funding for the department our first cut of priorities was
on things where there is a mandate on state law where we address funding
requirements and the state law requires in the governor’s budget there
is an inclusion for changes in enrollment in education and in
entitlement programs, so that would include the Medicaid program as well
as foster care and adoption assistance. The second prioritization that
we made was to look across the funding requests that were presented to
the governor and ask where is it that the state is already in progress
of making a commitment and are those commitments already fully funded,
so that type of budget recommendation would include absent policy shift,
that we operate state facilities, we need to fully fund them, continuing
in investing in the department’s information technology structure to
support services, the DOJ settlement, another requirement, and then
third, the third cut of looking at funding requests and options was to
look at priorities and thus you see recommendations again for community
mental health services, to continue to build that system, to continue
pre-K slots for more than 26,000 children and to make some other
investments that you see recommended in the budget. In our presentation
today we won’t go over every item that’s in the book. The book was
released last week and the Health and Human Services section includes
and itemizes every recommendation that the governor is making to this
body for consideration. We won’t go over them all but we’re happy to
answer questions about any of them. So, again, how we put together this
$5.3 billion budget and $5.5 billion budget that you see, in state law
we start by developing a baseline budget and it’s a fairly prescribed
process. We take the enacted budget that the General Assembly has
appropriated, we distribute any statewide reserves and that represents
the current year authorized budget and then in terms of making
adjustments from that authorized budget, we are required to go in and
make certain adjustments which are itemized in the next couple of
slides, but essentially it’s limited to a very few number of changes.
Overall, the DHHS budget was adjusted downward by $125 million. So what
are the changes that we made in this budget? The three changes that
affect the appropriations and tie out to the $128 million change is
taking appropriations made in the last section and annualizing the
impact of them if the General Assembly enacted new positions for less
than a year or significantly in the case of Medicaid where savings
measures were provided for in the budget, some of those were less than a
full year so we go back and we annualize the impact of those. Across the
department annualizing programs and/or new positions authorize
represents just under $18 million in the state’s DHHS budget. Removing
non-recurring decreases, and a lot of those are where we identify
leveraged Federal funds or other receipts subject to reevaluating them
annually, so those are nonrecurring appropriations, we restore the
appropriations in the budget because they were enacted as nonrecurring
and then to remove nonrecuring increases, that’s the largest share of
what has affect appropriations in the recommended base budget, and I’ve
itemized there in general statute in the state budget act those items
that are allowed to be changed in the base, so effectively the baseline
budget becomes a fairly neutralized starting point to begin the
discussion for major change, for reduction or expansion, all of which
are itemized in the governor’s recommended budget document. So I won’t
read the items on the slide here. I really included this in the
presentation

  <p id="10:00">
  There&#39;s 30 items that are related to General Fund appropriations
that were adjusted from the baseline budget.  Again, Medicaid represents
the largest share of those, and you&#39;ll see, particularly item is
annualising unnecessary expansion that the General Assembly appropriated
for Child Protective Services.
The next items, 2 through 9 are taking out, either in 2 through 8,
further annualising savings.  So, if a first year&#39;s savings, for
example, the Mental Health Drug Management was enacted at the six month
mark of the current state fiscal year so it should be effective January
1st.  It was a $6 million reduction in the current year, it has to be
doubled, so that&#39;s what you see in these items spelled out here.
So, this page is all of the items that were annualising one time, either
non-recurring expansions, I&#39;m sorry, annualising appropriations
either for expansion or for savings measures in the budget.
The next slide, the remaining 13 through 30, are all the items where
there was a non-recurring appropriation.  Say, for example, Senior
Center Capital Funding item 16, that was one time appropriation, so we
take it out of base budget.  The swap out of block grants to lessen the
demand on state funds, for example the Tannis Swap for pre-K, that
budgeted receipt save appropriations this year, because it&#39;s
non-recurring we build back , $128,491,661.
So, moving into some of the priorities for funding that the Governor is
recommending to the General Assembly for the biennium is an investment
in a comprehensive array of prevention, intervention, and treatment
services at the community level.  There&#39;s funding in the second year
of the biennium to increase 3-way psychiatric beds, this would increase
the capacity by 30, and bring to a total 195 3-way psychiatric beds.
Behavior Urgent Care and Facility Crisis services, again, and
appropriation of $2 million for outpatient residential services for
children and adult.  The Governor&#39;s budget recommends funding a
fourth Start Team, and extending coverage for NC-Start services to
children and adolescents, that&#39;s recommended from state
appropriations in the second year in the biennium.  In the recommended
budget there is reference that if there is funding available from
proceeds of the sale of the Dicks property, then it would be recommended
that those proceeds be used and that these initiatives could start
sooner rather than later.  TASK is funded in both years of this request
$1.9 million in the first year and the second year recurring to reduce
case load and accommodate for increases in referrals.
An item not reflected in the slide, but another investment in community
mental health is continued investment of about $7.8 million annually,
increasing each year to continue funding the DOJ settlement for people
with mental illness to live safely in their communities.  All of those
items in mental health build on an enacted base line budget of just
under $1.4 billion.
On the facility side of mental health, the Governor&#39;s budget
recommends a one-time non-recurring appropriation in the first year of
the biennium of $16.6 million to bring online the new Broughton
Hospital.  If you&#39;ll recall, those funds were enacted in the
biennium we&#39;re in now, but because of construction delays and
timing, the General Assembly was able to take back that funding in the
current year and we&#39;re requesting that it be re-appropriated to
bring the facility online this year.
Chronic budget shortfall in the state facilities, there&#39;s special
provision language in the current year budget bill requiring a report,
looking more closely at the state facilities, what&#39;s driving the
shortfall, the history of shortfalls, this has gone on for the immediate
past five years or so.  And what the Governor&#39;s budget is
recommending is an

  Million dollar recurring appropriation and this appropriation is what is
considered, what is assessed to be adequate after DHHS implements the
measures that were brought before the committee that would bring down of
their own accord $9.2 million in savings that the department is
committing to deliver to balance the facility’s budgets through a number
of measures that were outlined in the report. The next slide is further
discussion on the facility shortfall, some of the factors that have
contributed to this. Over time, delayed transition of patients and staff
to Central Regional Hospital when it opened several years ago, increased
expenses due to the patient acuity and increasing cost in providing for
the food and medical care of the patients being served and finally
patient mix and the variation in Medicare recoveries, third party and
other sources. I’ve included a current year outlook, so we know that at
June 30th of last year that the mental health budget ended with
outstanding liabilities of about $13 million. Those liabilities were
brought into the current state fiscal year so they have to be addressed
and in addition in a report as late as last night the department is
currently estimating that their anticipated gap in this year will be $20
million. That’s greater than what was provided in the oversight report
to joint legislative oversight during the interim, so when you look at
that combined with outstanding liabilities being brought forward and the
current year estimate of the gap between spending, receipts and
appropriations to support it, the liabilities at June 30, 2015 would be
approximately $33 million. Historically there’s not a non-recurring
appropriation recommended in the governor’s budget. It has historically
been that at year end the department has reversion or appropriation out
of their $5 billion budget that we have in the past been able under
executive authority to carry forward, the process of carrying forward
unspent cash into the subsequent year to liquidate unfunded, unpaid
liabilities at June 30th. Other investments in core public health
include further funding building on investments this body made last
session and has made in the last couple of years, tremendous investments
in the office of the chief medical examiner. The governor’s budget would
add $335,000 in the first year of the biannum, $4.2 million in the
second year. The recommendations that you see here were certainly
informed by a legislative oversight report earlier this year in the
fall. We were not able to fund everything. I think what you see here is
an investment in the medical/legal death investigators to add to what
the medical examiners are doing to improve the medical examinations
taking place. The governor’s budget funds two forensic pathology
fellowships. It adds funding so that all medical examiners would go
through required medical examiner training and it supports costs
associated with becoming nationally accredited and further there is
funding to bring, I think the goal of the department in requesting
funding for the medical examination fees and autopsy fees is to, in the
case of the autopsies, fund them at closer to what the cost is actually
being incurred, something around $2,800 per autopsy. Electronic death
record system. This is also referenced in the NC Gear report. This
recommendation would provide funding to develop an electronic death
record system. It would eventually replace the state’s paper-based
system. The vital records agency handles about 83,000 death records per
year and we know there’s delays in people being able to receive those
records and we expect that this appropriation would improve this
turnaround, increase the security of data and also help with public
health data and analytics

  In terms of supporting families and children in the current year the,
for the past last year and this year the foster care program
unfortunately is experiencing caseload growth. The program is projecting
that the caseload growth will be 6% in the first year of the bianuum and
3% in the second year of the bianuum and the governor’s budget
recommends the funding that’s needed to make payments on behalf of these
children to the families and facilities where they are fostered and also
makes a recommendation for adoption assistance. The trends are not
showing the increases in the first year. We’re looking for growth in the
number of children finding permanent places in the second year of the
bianuum and this recommendation is to fund that. For clarity it does not
increase the amount of the payments being made, it covers the volume in
caseload being projected. In the current year the General Assembly
funded additional slots in the NC Pre-K program for high quality
preschool services to at-risk 4 year olds. That was funded from
non-recurring appropriations. The governor’s budget recommends
maintaining those slots, continuing those on a permanent basis and funds
them from a combination of increased lottery proceeds, about $2.7
million and $2.3 on a recurring basis here. Continuing to invest in
information technology supporting the development and operations and
maintenance of NC Fast and NC Tracks. We know NC Fast is families
accessing services through technology. That’s replacing multiple legacy
systems and is the main system being used for our citizens to become
enrolled and access social services and, of course, NC Tracks replacing
the Medicaid Management Information System and paying our providers for
services rendered through multiple medical programs, primarily Medicaid
HealthChoice but also through the mental health system and other safety
net healthcare purchase, medical care programs in the department. So
funding here the governor’s recommending for the IT development and
implementation, NC Fast $5.8 million and $13 million in the second year
of the bianuum. It continues rolling out modules and functionality for
NC Tracks and NC Fast, and NC Tracks, this funding here, $2.3 million is
for ICD10 compliance by October 2015 and then in terms of operations and
maintenance the recommendation is that the NC Fast project receives an
increased appropriation, itemized in the recommended budget, but this is
funded through block grant receipts which is why the total reflected
here is 0 in terms of state funded appropriations, and NC Tracks,
$400,000 to augment the funding that already exists in the department’s
budget to support the ongoing staff at DHHS and operations for NC
Tracks. We’ve also included in this budget savings from information
technology. The governor’s budget is proposing savings of $4.7 million
from the transition from the old NMMIS contract to the current one. This
is in addition to incremental savings that have been identified in
previous appropriations bills but I included those here for your
reference. Medicaid, the first slide is really just to introduce the
concept of Medicaid spending and what Medicaid spending looks like over
a period of time. Medicaid is funded with federal dollars matched with
state appropriations and other revenues. Federal dollars make up about
2/3 of the total spending and a not insignificant state investment of
the balance. To, I think what I hope to demonstrate by the slide is not
just that Medicaid spending in 2014

  is just over 8 billion in total requirements and in excess of 13 billion
by the end of 2014. But also how the non-federal portion of Medicaid
gets provided. The bottom darker blue is the state appropriation and
then the next piece, the middle bar, demonstrates how this program
relies very heavily on other receipts that act as state match in the
Medicaid budget. That&#39;s provider assessments, drug rebates if you
look at the year of 2012 a big jump up in total spending, implementing
retroactively provider assessments, budget shortfalls. Other receipts in
that category would be the transfers that had to be made from other
state agencies to act as the match for the Medicaid program. So it&#39;s
in this context that we&#39;d like to talk about the Medicaid rebase
recommendation here. And certainly hope that this body would acknowledge
and consider the governor&#39;s recommendation for a Medicaid risk
reserve outside of the Medicaid agency. It&#39;s recommended in the
governor&#39;s budget as recurring and non-reverting, so that it could
create a reserve outside of Medicaid to help mitigate against the impact
of fluctuations, both in how this occurs and both in how it is managed.
So in developing the Medicaid rebase, the first step is always the
Medicaid rebase necessarily builds on an estimate of where Medicaid is
for the current state fiscal year. So I thought we&#39;d put in a slide
to give you a snapshot of where things stand in Medicaid through the
financial reports as of February. So the authorized budget in the
current year is the $13.7 billion receipts of ten, and enacted
authorized appropriation of $3.688 billion. So as Medicaid closed the
books for February, the actual expenditures are reflected in the middle
column, and then the percent of budget that has been expended is
what&#39;s reflected on the far righthand side. This is total Medicaid
spending, I would point out. So it&#39;s payments for all activities of
Medicaid, not just provider payments, but supplemental hospital, current
year, prior year adjustments. It includes the salaries, the payroll, the
contractor cost, and the receipts you see reflect the matching federal
funds, drug rebates to date, and all other collections. So folks that
follow Medicaid often look at Medicaid checkwrites. And checkwrites
refer to those payments that get made out of NCTracks to providers. It
includes LMEMCO, capitated payments, fee for service payments. It
excludes, obviously there&#39;s none of the salaries or contractual
obligations for administrative support of the agency. So I wanted to
give you a look-see at where Medicaid is as of March 3rd on their
checkwrite budget. The checkwrite budget is just under $10.9 billion.
Checkwrites reported by Medicaid through March 3rd, $7.488 billion. So
the share of the checkwrite budget that&#39;s been expended is about
68.9%. We wanted to take a look at, because obviously at this point
we&#39;re still trying to estimate the remaining months of the state
fiscal year. We looked back at four previous years and said, Well, in
the first week in March, what percentage of total expenditure through
June 30 was the first week of March? So the average, the four year
average percent of budget expended through the first week of March is
68.8%. And there was about 3/4 of a percent variance from the low to the
high. And of course we do our back of the envelope. If this, depending
on what percentage we are at this point in the year, this would put us
either slightly over budget or under budget. I will tell you that the
Medicaid agency right now is estimating to end 2015 with a positive cash
balance. I say that because it&#39;s not just a function of what happens
  </p>

  With the claims and the check writes but also a function of all of their
other accounting adjustments. Any repayments of federal funds that have
been received and owed back, any overcollection of receipts that would
help contribute to the bottom line of cash that remains in June 30th.
Moving into the rebase, so to transition from the last slide, for the
rebase DHHS, the scenario that was provided and that was used for the
governor’s recommended budget projected that the current year Medicaid
budget would come in $124 million under budget. I will tell you that I
think as these, the model is updated with more current year to date
expenditure activity and revenue activity that that amount will come
down. That it will not be as high as $124 million under budget. This is
the first year that DHHS has prepared a Medicaid forecast using their
new model. Their model is a collaboration between the department and
Alvarez and Marcel. They have used it to help them with forecasting the
2015 expenditures and to develop the 2015-17 forecast. The model
incorporates historical data, expected program changes resulting from
legislation or policy and incorporates that they have made every effort
to externally validate the model. Their objective, of course, is to
provide a forecast that has the best assumptions and informations that’s
currently available. In terms of outputs, so far state budget, we have
received 2 iterations of the model that are produced by DHHS, one using
actual expenditure data through October 31st and a second using actual
data through December 31st. The model’s heavily influenced by enrollment
scenarios and incorporates SASS forecasting. It looks historically, it
looks at economic considerations fueled by IHS Global Insights to help
inform what they think will happen around economic conditions and then,
of course, looks at what the model refers to as shocks. Those are things
that have happened that are extraordinary within the Medicaid budget and
attempts to try to smooth for those and forecast forward. An example of
that would be the movement of 70,000 plus children from HealthChoice
into Medicaid. So the variables here, of course, are what assumptions
are being made about the trends, the current trends and where we’ll go
on enrollment, services consumed, which ones and the cost of services.
The Medicaid experts are here to talk in detail if you’d like to about
how we’ve arrived at the recommended rebase that you see here. I will
tell you that the methodology is essentially looking at every program
aid category whether that’s Medicaid Infants and Children, AFDC
population or newly eligible, all of the categories, then it is looked
at each category of expenditure across medicaid and made a forecast
about enrollment, what services, consumption and mix. So they are
prepared to talk further on that. The governor is recommending a rebase
of $287.5 million in the first year of the biannum and $460.6 million in
the second year of the biannum. I think we would again say that this is
an early estimate. We have to go early in the process and we’re basing
this on 6 months, actually there’s 30 months worth of forecasting in
this, 6 months of this year and 24 months of the biannum going forward,
so we fully expect a robust conversation about assumptions updating for
the current year and further refining the rebase estimate. The next
slide provides a greater amount of detail on the rebase. It gives us

  Removed the one time appropriation of $136 million and annualized for
savings that are meant to be achieved at the direction of the General
Assembly. The major assumptions around enrollment growth are listed on
this slide as you can see. For the biannum, 4.6% growth in the first
year, 3.6%, that’s down quite a bit from what’s being experienced in the
first year. We’re over 106,000 new recipients have been added again.
What’s driving that? ACA process changes, North Carolina process
changes. HHS can help us talk in greater detail about what’s driving
that. How when the rebase was received in the Office of State Budget and
Management the approach was to work within, there were multiple outputs
and options to choose within the Medicaid forecast. We, the governor’s
budget incorporates the scenario that has the highest degree of
confidence within the Medicaid agency and then underwent just a couple
of changes when it got to the State Budget Office and those changes
were, we had been given a proposal for savings, to itemize savings in
Medicaid from a policy change that’s being implemented in the current
year so we asked that that be incorporated in the model. It was a
utilization issue and didn’t require an action of the General Assembly,
so that’s been adjusted in this $287 and $460 million that you see
respectively. In addition, the model looks at every expenditure in
Medicaid and we don’t rebate state appropriated salaries and we don’t
rebate priorly earned revenue so we adjusted for those effects and
finally for the first time Medicaid built in to their model forecast a
1% risk reserve based on 1% of the claims budget. The governor is
recommending not to fund that in the Medicaid budget, but to set aside
the $50 million and $125 million in a reserve outside of the Medicaid
agency. Medicaid reform, the governor is recommending that the
administration be authorized to proceed with Medicaid reform that is
patient-centered, provider led with the goal of improving the healthcare
for citizens and to contain healthcare costs. To facilitate that there
is a recommendation of $1.1 million in appropriations in each year of
the biannum and that would fund staffing to get the department staffed
up to proceed with reform and the funds that are necessary to hire the
actuaries to establish the benchmarks and to do more of the heavy lift
on Medicaid reform is assumed to be funded within the Medicaid budget
from their substantial existing contract budget. Finally, HealthChoice.
Again, less detail here on HealthChoice, but again, same process, same
model was used. Also heavily enrollment centric. This slide represents
the detail of the governor’s recommendation at this point in time for
the Medicaid rebase prior your actual expenditures reflected. The
forecast for the current year, DMA is estimating that the, that the
HealthChoice budget will come in actually overbudget this year with the
current estimate that it would require about $750,000 in state funds to
keep the HealthChoice payments through June 30th. Recommended rebase of
$5.5 million in the first year of the biannum, $6.4 million in the
second year of the biannum and the same adjustments were made to this
budget as were made to the Medicaid budget and that is implement
policies into the rebase rather than itemize them as change and remove
the effect of the model for funds like salaries and contracts that don’t
get an automatic increase or decrease in the rebase process. Again, we
very much appreciate the opportunity to be here

  Today to share with you recommendations from Governor McCrory in the
2015-17 budget. We’re pleased to report these investments in access to
healthcare, mental health, public health infrastructure, support for
families and children and we look forward to working with you I hope not
just today but through this process, working to update and provide
information as needed to this committee. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Miss Kilpatrick. We’re gonna move on to the committee
discussion starting with Senator Hise’s questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you Miss Kilpatrick for your
presentation and I do hope we continue to work together quite a bit and
I suspect that we will. We’ve got quite a long way to go kind from this
purpose forward. The first question that I wanted to ask, on page 7 from
your presentation looking at continuations from the previous year, and I
have, I have a similar question about several of these coming through,
but specifically looking at number 5, the single base rate, we have
projected for a 6 month period a $10.8 million savings. We expected that
to continue on but as the spa was actually submitted to the feds it
actually became a $1 million increase each year, so if we’re gonna
continue that $10.8 million is it the recommendation of the governor’s
budget that we actually resubmit the spa as originally intended and
originally calculated so that we only have a single base rate and didn’t
have multiple base rates for other facilities? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Senator Hise. Certainly the base rate, implementation of the base
rate has been an item of discussion between the department and the
legislature and acknowledging that the way it has been implemented has
not achieved the savings that was envisioned by the General Assembly but
instead has actually resulted in a net increase in the budget. I think
from, I’d like to take a state budget perspective for a moment. The
savings have been removed from the budget. The forecast that meant that
Medicaid has provided would indicate that they are seeing a trend of
achieving savings. In terms, I know that this body has suggested helping
the department with additional language on how to achieve the base rate
savings the way that they were enacted and envisioned and I think that
that will continue to be a point of discussion in this committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Next thing I
wanted to ask and I’ll get some other things on that in a moment.
Looking at NC Fast and NC Tracks, we’re given some cost here for the
development and implementation as well as the operations and
maintenance. Is the assumption for the development and implementation,
the numbers we show here as state dollars or are we actually continuing
to receive a 90% match for development on those, so if we’re talking
about a $13 million, it’s really $130 million investment, state and
federal funds? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, we are continuing to receive
90% federal funding on the Tracks system. Would you allow me to defer to
my staff for more detail on that, Joe White with the Office of State
Budget and Management. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Joe White with OSBM. NC Fast,
there are some projects that we assume will qualify for 90/10 which is
the project 3. The project 4 which is the social services projects will
not qualify for 90/10 so we will not make that assumption, so you can’t
assume that all that will be matched 90/10. So it’s a little bit of a
mixture and we can get the detail to your staff so that they can take a
look. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Appreciate it. One final follow up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Let’s make it quick. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
The last one I wanna ask is on the risk reserve where we have a $50
million added into the risk reserve. This current year we have $186
million risk reserve, so are we adding 50 to that or are we taking the
full

  hundred and eighty six away and replacing it with a fifty dollar risk
reserve without the triggers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator it&#39;s the later the governors recommended budget is adding
the hundred and eighty six million dollar recurring risk reserve making
the proposal that the hundred eighty six million dollar risk reserve be
added back to availability and then be appropriated in the form of fifty
million in the first year one hundred and twenty five ongoing. I think
the bigger difference is the one hundred eighty million dollars is
earmarked and appropriated but reserved for Medicaid risk and the
governors recommendation would make the risk reserve accessible to the
executive branch outside of Medicaid but accessible if necessary with
reporting and accountability back. And also to start accumulating a
balance which would be similar under either well actually it&#39;s
slightly different than the legislative since it&#39;s not appropriated.
But it is not in addition to it is in place of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good thank you. Senator Barringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair and thank your very much for your report. I&#39;d
like to call your attention to slide number fourteen probably no
surprise that I&#39;ll be asking questions about that. First of all I
thank the executive and the governor for paying attention to our extreme
need on foster care and adoption. I wanna make sure I understand this
adoption assistance zero. Does that mean there will be no funding for
adoption assistance or no increase in funding?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator it&#39;s the latter there is no increase recommended in the
first year but there is an increase to account for growing case load in
the second year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s really more of a comment than a question. Adoption assistance
is very important and in some regards it will actually drive adoptions
and the increase in adoptions and it&#39;s not that people adopt
children to get the money it&#39;s that many of these children have
severe needs that are being covered by Medicaid and other services in
foster care supplements and assistance. And the decision to actually
adopt you have to be able to parent a child and if you don&#39;t have
enough resources to be able to parent the child then your not going to
adopt it would not make sense to adopt. And so I would like for us to
take a look at that zero dollars increase because I think it will have a
chilling effect on adoption I think it will be a part of what will hold
adoption steady and it is far more efficient both long term and short
term to get these children in permanent homes and I&#39;m sure we all
agree so I&#39;d like for us to continue looking at that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Your welcome. Chairman Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman I have a couple of questions. I to would like to
move to slide fifteen regarding the investments in information
technology and just for my information the modules you refer to in
rolling out an NC fast could you enumerate a little more clearly the
specific projects contributing to the cost over the biennium?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure I&#39;ll be glad to Joe ?? again. There are going to be three
different projects associated with this project. One is project seven
which is the federal change in operability and their closing that out.
Project three will be a new project that deals with subsidized child
care, low income energy assistance, and the crises intervention program.
And there will be third project known as project four which deals with
social services case management. So what we&#39;re looking at is ninety
ten funding for project seven and project three but not the ninety ten
for project four.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and follow up if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On project four not for discussion here but I&#39;d like a little more
detail about what that&#39;s encompassing if you don&#39;t mind. And
also in terms of the certification for NC tracks what is our current
status on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I know is I might need to defer to the department for the specifics
I think it was initiated in the last couple of months I might defer to
them to give you a fuller update.

  Recommendation on certification at the end of March and so we’re still
on schedule for end of March to hear back from them. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, great, and one last follow up. On slide 20 we talk about that
fairly significant jump in the rebase. Could you go back over and maybe
enumerate a little more about what types of assumptions are driving
that. I know you were talking about we’ve got a significant bump in
enrollment just recently because ACA changes. What other factors
specifically are attributed to that increase? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
ma’am. Mr. Chairman, can we have staff try to provide a little more in
depth as well as potentially try to have the department help on some of
the more specific. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can somebody answer this question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sarah Grimsby, OSBM, with respect to the large jumps
in enrollment that we’re seeing specific to this fiscal year and in the
previous 6 months, the Affordable Care Act policy changes as well as NC
specific policy changes are driving the spike in enrollment that you
see. With respect to the federal changes that were made, the, I
apologize. My apologies, I just wanted to make sure I was looking at the
right page. The Affordable Care Act as enacted eliminated asset and
resource eligibility determinations for the program 8 categories that
are magi program 8 categories. They increased the income eligibility
limits as well as excluding certain assets in that eligibility
determination. As a result and by example, in the AFDC program 8
categories we were seeing that significant jump because individuals who
would otherwise be ineligible because their income or they possess
certain assets making them ineligible were now eligible for Medicaid. If
you, with respect to the net impact for enrollees for just that program
8 category, the net impact was you have 33,000 more enrollees in AFDC
alone. These effects of the Affordable Care Act changes trickled down to
the other program 8 categories as well, but the AFDC is where we’ve seen
the most significant jump as far as detailed analysis on each program 8
category I can certainly follow up with your office and give you a more
itemized list of how those changes impacted each program 8 category.
With respect to the North Carolina policy changes, as a result of
changes to, well, the policy changes that were enacted and I apologize,
an individual having to come in and bring in their documents for a
renewal of Medicaid eligibility. We no longer, we have the capacity now
to do exparte renewals where an individual no longer comes in. We’re
able to mine data so to speak to pull that information out of our data
system so that they are automatically renewed and I think that that
explains a lot of it with respect to the AFDC growth and, like I said, I
can follow up with your office and the rest of the committee with more
specifics on the other program 8 categories. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, before you go any further I wanna make
a point that we’ve got to be out of here before 10. We’ve got a lot of
questions, we’re going slowly, so I’m gonna ask that we keep our follow
ups to a minimum or at least that the questions be expeditious and
short. Next question, Chairman Tucker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
  </p>

  <p id="55:00">
  Not that we’re going slow, it’s just you come from a place where you
talk fast. Quickly here, Miss Kilpatrick, you mentioned that there’d be
a $33 million shortfall, is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry,
senator, how much? [SPEAKER CHANGES] $33 million. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, typically we see
reversions in DHHS across all of the budget codes. It varies from year
to year, yet last year we saw about $100 million and excluding Medicaid,
about half of it, $60 million was Medicaid. The priority for funding
critical needs in DHHS from OSBM’s perspective, we would see sufficient
reversions to support a mental health shortfall. The department will
also tell you they look at other unfunded liabilities across the
department. So the question is that historically there’s been more than
$33 million in reversions across DHHS. Our priority for addressing those
would be to carry forward for the mental health liabilities. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? So that would be a yes I think. Based on the 106,000
enrollees in January and February, what’s the annualized rate and what
would we expect that to cost if it were to trend out throughout the
year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So I think the answer to that is that the annual
enrollment growth is 10.2%. I don’t have a calculation that extends
enrollment at that level. Right, right. We can get that for you,
senator. We can ask in this new model that can be input with different
scenarios to run a model that would take a 10% plus enrollment growth
and extend it over the bianuum and report that back. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last question, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yeah we need to look at that cause that’s real, that’s a
smoking gun. We all need to look at that. Let me punt this over to Joe
Cooper. Mr. Cooper, a question if I may, Mr. Chairman. The LMEMCO
payments that were in arrears, have they all been cleared? All of them
are cleared and paid through the 3rd of March? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Tucker, about 80% was paid in the last capitation payment in February
and the remaining 25% will be paid in the April capitation payment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pendleton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
ma’am. Mr. Chair, can I address Miss Kilpatrick? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
go right ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. I have, as most of the
committee knows,  I have, my business is installing corporate health and
non-profit health insurance plans and managing them. You’re recommending
the ACO model and I like the ACO model. PPO model’s been around about 25
years and we’ve had double digit increases on the average every year,
but it, there are not enough networks established now to be able to do
that in the state of North Carolina. I mean, it’s really tough even in
Wake County on the networks, so they have to be developed, but I was in
favor of that cause I’m leading my clients there as the networks become
available. But I heard a presentation from the state of Florida, and I
just wanna ask you are you familiar with the Florida model because it
gives a cafeteria approach, you can be in a PPO, you can be in an ACO,
you can even be on Medicaid if you want to and for me that has a lot of
appeal. Have you looked at Florida’s approach? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you for the question. In terms of the state budget office’s involvement,
we’ve certainly tried to follow what other states are doing in terms of
Medicaid reform and reform options. Leading the way in the North
Carolina recommendations on Medicaid reform is the Department of Health
and Human Services and if I may I am certain that Dr. Robin Cummings,
the Director of Medical Assistance could address that question more
specifically about if they have looked at that particular model and
could inform this if I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you get that for
Representative Pendleton off book a little bit later on in email or
something like that or visit with him? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will follow
up, yes, sir, with all measures. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. You’ve got
a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I address Senator Hise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go right
ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar tells me you’re the in
house expert

  General Assembly on Medicaid and I feel like I’ve been left in the dark
on this. What are we moving towards on Medicaid? What’s the game plan to
do something about it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess I’m kind of on the spot
on that one. It’s coming through. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s make this
quick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would say that you would see that the Florida
model that you spoke about is very similar to the Senate proposal that
came across last year and is part of a lot of discussions that are going
on, but we are meeting with individuals in the House and others and
would love to come to a conclusion on this, but I think your support for
that type of mixed use model, you have a lot of colleagues in the House
that need to hear that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Farmer-Butterfield, you’re up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
My question is about [sliding in?] and it’s kind of programatic and
fiscal in terms of the treatment alternatives for safer communities.
You’re reducing the caseloads and you’re accommodating increased
referrals, I think that’s wonderful. Can you give me a specific way that
people will be impacted because of this $1.9 million? Is it gonna be
case management or what? Is it for people with psychiatric concerns or
just who are they? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dave Richard with DHHS, thank you,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer-Butterfield, back over
here. Thank you. The task program is a program that supports people that
are leaving our jails and prisons who have mental health, who have
substance use disorders and often co-occurring mental health needs and
the reason for our reduction in the caseloads in that in these
individuals, what we know is that if we can provide this intensive work
with our probation and parole officers along with these task counselors
we can keep people from going back to prison and jail and it is a good
thing for both public safety and for the mental health system and
frankly for the state. So that’s the goal of it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you for that response cause that’s an excellent thing to do in my
opinion and I’m very familiar with people who are coming  out of prison
and do not have any benefits and actually do not have a place to live,
so hopefully this will help with that as well, directly and indirectly.
My second question, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go right ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is on the expanded staff, 22 full time equivalent
positions and I believe that was for the Medicaid program for
transitioning. What is the total cost for those positions in terms of
the Medicaid budget or the percentage. The 22 full time equivalent
positions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So the total that’s recommended in the
governor’s budget is the grand total for all the staffing and that
recommendation of $1.16 million is their salaries, their fringe benefits
and associated operational expense. In terms of a percentage, 1% of the
total Medicaid budget, 1% of $5.3, $1 million as a percent of $5.3
billion, and we’re gonna get the total that they spend on salaries
already. If we can have just a minute, we can follow up and hand that to
you before we walk out of this room. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick
isn’t here. Senator Robinson, would you like to ask your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a couple. Some of my
questions have been answered, but if we look at slide, the HealthChoice
rebate page and that’s next to the last one I believe and can you tell
me for the rebates for both years what the estimated number of children
entering HealthChoice, what is the estimated number based on that
increase in the rebates? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Robinson. Sarah Grimsby from OSBM. When we’re talking
about the number of children in the HealthChoice program, the average
monthly enrollment for the first fiscal year of the bianuum

  Is 125,284 and for the second year of the biannum it’s $163,856.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go right
ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
So are any children transitioning? You know, I know that before we
transition a lot of children into HealthChoice we finish with that
process I’m assuming, so is that just new children entering who are not
in any healthcare system or where are they coming from? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Those are the new enrollees to the HealthChoice program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one other follow up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go right ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And if we flip back to the Medicaid
rebase I heard what you said to Representative Avila but I still don’t
understand the increase from the $287 million to the $460 million in the
second part of the biannum. That’s a tremendous increase in rebase
amount, so I don’t understand how 33,000 new enrollees could, you know,
could calculate up to that amount of money. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go right ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator,
so the Medicaid rebase in the second year combines the total of the
first year and builds and adds for the second year so that’s why the
number looks like that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You good? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman could I answer the question that  I didn’t follow up with
which is the total amount of the administrative budget if I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go right ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So the total salary
budget for the Division of Medical Assistance is $27.3 million, so we
have a $1.1 million increase. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I actually don’t have any questions I just want to get some
additional information and one is I’d like to request, I don’t know if
anybody else wants this or not, but if other people have requested
information I would like to receive that too. I’m especially interested
in the request that Representative Avila made. I would like to know the
cuts to any mental health services, either state funds or Medicaid, over
the past 10 years. You can, I think you can provide that, cuts to
Medicaid services, and I would also like the average per patient cost in
the Medicaid patients for the last 10 years, average cost per year per
Medicaid patient. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. We’ll follow
up and provide that and share it with the committee as well. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I don’t see Senator McKissick. We still have a little bit of
time left. Does anybody else have any questions? Representative
Pendleton, seeing as we’ve got a little extra time you had a question I
suggested we talk about off-book, but I think we certainly have the time
to have that answered here now. I was a little worried about time but
we’re moving along. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Beg your
pardon? [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Okay, yes, Dr. Cummings if you could
answer. Or if you want to restate the question, Representative
Pendleton? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll try cause I lost my train of thought.
Thank you. Doc, would you please tell me if you all have looked at the
Florida model versus just recommending an ACO because it allows people
choices. They can be on either an ACO or they can be on a PPO or they
can be on plain old Medicaid. They can make their choice, so have you
all looked at the Florida model? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Over the last few
months, and that’s a good question, Representative. Of the last several
months the department really has looked at a lot of states. We’ve looked
at Colorado, we’ve looked at Oregon, we’ve looked at Minnesota, but
Florida is a state that we have, we’ve looked at. Our model is a
provider-led ACO model and that’s the model that we proposed back in
March of last year and it’s the one that we feel that we have the
strongest support by our providers and that we can implement and we
believe that it will give us the sustainability and predictability in
our budget that the General Assembly is looking for and again, we feel
like it’s the one that our providers can support. It’s very
patient-centric, provider-oriented so that’s the model that we’re
proposing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I
realize, I know that the North Carolina Medical Society and the North
Carolina Hospital Association are in favor of that

And from being in that line of work, by the way I partnered with your
good friend George Little, so he can answer these things, too.  But I
just think being able to get choices would be a good, to give people
choices, it would be a good way to go after it, so I wish you would look
