<h1>About</h1>
<p>Capitol Hound is a searchable audio archive from the 2013-2016 legislative sessions of the North Carolina General Assembly. Its searchable archives contain audio and transcripts from the House and Senate floor, as well as key committee meetings. <b>As of 2017, it is no longer being updated.</b></p>

<p>Capitol Hound was a product from the Reese News Lab, initially explored in the Summer of 2013. Thanks to a $35,000 grant from the <a href="http://reesenewslab.org/2014/04/23/reese-news-lab-wins-35000-knight-foundation-grant-to-launch-searchable-n-c-general-assembly-archive-and-alert-system/" target="_blank">Knight Foundation</a>, Capitol Hound launched in May 2014. In 2015, with the $50,000 <a href="http://reesenewslab.org/2015/01/28/48607/" target="_blank"> C. Felix Harvey Award for Institutional Priorities</a>, Reese News Lab offered Capitol Hound to all North Carolina news outlets at no charge.</p>

<p>Capitol Hound was designed with journalists, lobbyists, lawyers and advocacy groups in mind. It allowed users to stay up-to-date with the General Assembly and to navigate hours of session audio quickly.</p>

<p>Using transcription services, Capitol Hound was able to make hours of audio from the General Assembly searchable by quote, allowing users to search for any phrase that may have been spoken in an N.C. General Assembly session. Though it is no longer updated, the audio archives remain available to the public.</p>
