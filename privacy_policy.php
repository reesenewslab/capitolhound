<p>Last Modified: May 8, 2014</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for www.CapitolHound.org (the “Site”) of the Reese News Lab ("Reese," "we," "our," "us") of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. By visiting or using our Site and related services (the “Services”), you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on our Site and applicable Services and update the "Last Updated/ Effective Date."  By continuing to use this Site or other Services after we post any such changes, you have accepted the Privacy Policy as modified. This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into our Terms of Use Agreement (“TOU”) by reference. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same meaning as defined in the TOU.

<h3>Types of Information We Collect and Use</h3>
<p>
We collect and/or use information in three (3) categories: (1) personally-identifiable information (“PII”) that you voluntarily provide when you register or participate in any features or activities on this Site or offline, (2) information that we passively collect as you navigate or use our Services such as IP Address, unique device ID, or transaction and viewing history; and (3) non-personal information that cannot be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as anonymous and aggregated information. We may also collect and use PII about other people when you participate in certain programs and features or when you submit news stories or nominations for community awards or recognition that involve other people.
</p>
<p>
Reese will use an independent third party to conduct a payment transaction in a secured manner and that entity will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, storage and disposal of your PII such as credit or debit account number. We do not collect or receive credit or debit card account or other online payment information. Your payment transaction will be governed by the payment provider’s privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
We ask for your consent prior to collecting or accessing PII and location-based information. You may withdraw your consent by changing your options or disabling a service according to your device settings.
</p>
<p>
We may also share individual or aggregated PII with third parties such as data analytic providers, and operational service providers.
</p>
<h3>Monitoring Technologies</h3>
<p>
In order to manage and evaluate usage of our Site and other Services, improve our content and operations and protect the security of our Site, we monitor your activity and usage via your IP Address and/or unique device ID.   Like most standard websites or online services, the Site and other Services may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology that improve the user’s experience by allowing the website to recognize the user’s computer or device. You may configure your browser to reject cookies. If you do so, you might not be able to log-in to your account, access important functions, or other Site features.
</p>
<h3>Disclosure of PI to Third Parties</h3>
<p>
Information about our customers is important to us and we will not sell this information to others. We will not rent, sell, or share your PII with unaffiliated companies or people except: 1) as necessary to provide you with products or services you've requested; 2) when we have your permission; or 3) as follows:
<ul>
<li>We will disclose your PII to trusted partners and service providers who work on our behalf under confidentiality agreements. These entities will use your PII to help us serve you. However, these entities are not allowed to share your PI without authorization.</li>
<li>We will disclose your PII to conform to legal requirements or may do so to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process, irrespective of applicable law.</li>
<li>We will disclose your PII to enforce our TOU, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Reese, other users and visitors, the public, or our employees and students. </li>
<li>In the event that all or some of our assets are acquired by another entity, PII may be among the transferred assets.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Safeguarding Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>
Our Services are generally targeted to adults.  Unless we indicate otherwise, you must be at least 18 years old to register and to use the Site and Services.  Generally, we will not knowingly collect online PII or any other identifying data from children under 13 years of age. Should we discover that a child under the age of 13 submitted PII to our Site, or other Services without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, we will immediately reject any such entry and delete that information from our database (to the extent technically feasible), unless such information meets an exception under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
</p>
<h3>Your Communication Choices</h3>
<p>
Users who no longer wish to receive alerts, notifications, or promotional messages from us via email may choose to unsubscribe via www.CapitolHound.org. All emails also include opt-out instructions. Alerts sent via text message also have an opt-out mechanism.  Please be aware that we may continue to contact you for administrative, transactional or informational purposes related to your use of our Services, including follow-up messages regarding transactions you have undertaken. By law, such messages are not considered to be unsolicited commercial messages.
