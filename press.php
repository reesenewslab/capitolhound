<h3>Quote from Senator Ellie Kinnaird's weekly activities news letter:</h3>

<p>"My second event of the day was a presentation at the UNC Journalism School on their projects to create breakthrough media innovation.  They had three criteria: feasibility, viability and desirability.  Could it be done, could it make money and would people like it.  One of the presentations was of personal interest: an instant alert system for journalists, lobbyists, and advocates when a legislative bill that would affect them came up.  This would eliminate their sitting in committee meetings on the chance that something came up unexpectedly, such as the abortion bill that arose at 8:00 p.m. without notice.  Again, I was impressed by the energy and ideas of these young people."</p>
